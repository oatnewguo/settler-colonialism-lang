  <div id="pub_extinguished" class="analysis">
    <p>One of the verbs most strongly associated with indigenous peoples in the published books was "extinguished." We looked into the texts and found that extinguishing indigenous peoples' claims to land by means of treaties was an oft-mentioned topic for decades.</p>

    <blockquote>The lands in which the Indian title is <strong>extinguished</strong> and which are now purchasing under the United States . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>The First Map and Description of Ohio</cite>, 1787</p>

    <blockquote>The first purchase of land in the State of Ohio, after the Indian title was <strong>extinguished</strong>, was made by the Ohio company.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>A Topographical Description of the State of Ohio, Indiana Territory, and Louisiana</cite>, 1812</p>

    <blockquote>The Indian title, by various treaties, has been <strong>extinguished</strong> to about 70,000 square miles . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Brown, <cite>The Western Gazetteer; or, Emigrant's Directory</cite>, 1817</p>

    <blockquote>The Indian title to most of these lands has been <strong>extinguished</strong>.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Dana, <cite>Geographical Sketches on the Western Country</cite>, 1819</p>

    <blockquote>. . . the estimated amount of unsold lands, on which the foreign and Indian titles had been <strong>extinguished</strong>, within the limits of the new States and Territories, was 227,293,884 acres . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Peck, <cite>A New Guide for Emigrants to the West</cite>, 1837</p>

    <p>Sometimes, these passages were accompanied by descriptions of indigenous peoples leaving and moving into other lands, leaving their former homes wide open for settlement.</p>

    <blockquote>After the establishment of peace by General Wayne, at Greenville, in 1795, at which time large tracts of land were ceded to the United States, nearly all the Indians who resided on the lands, to which their claims were <strong>extinguished</strong>, retread back, and found new places of residence.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>A Topographical Description of the State of Ohio, Indiana Territory, and Louisiana</cite>, 1812</p>

    <p>With phrases such as "the Indian tittle [sic] must, at all events, be extinguished" and "When the Indian claims are extinguished," some authors emphasized the imperative and inevitability of extinguishing indigenous land claims in the future.</p>

    <blockquote>. . . the United States will probably have no objection, as the Indian tittle must, at all events, be <strong>extinguished</strong> . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Brown, <cite>The Western Gazetteer; or, Emigrant's Directory</cite>, 1817</p>

    <blockquote>The western part of the state might, in its turn, have the same control over the eastern part, whenever the entire <strong>extinguishment</strong> of Indian titles should take place.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Darby, <cite>The Emigrant's Guide to the Western and Southwestern States and Territories</cite>, 1818</p>

    <blockquote>When the Indian claims are <strong>extinguished</strong>, this state will possess 28,480,000 acres of land . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Darby, <cite>The Emigrant's Guide to the Western and Southwestern States and Territories</cite>, 1818</p>

    <p>By repeatedly describing the extinguishing of indigenous land claims, the authors of these books painted the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains as an open, unclaimed land where settlers could find new homes. This turned a blind eye to the fact that the people who signed treaties ceding indigenous lands often did not represent the entire communities that laid claim to those lands. Many indigenous people did not consider their right to their lands extinguished, despite the outcome of treaties, but this nuance was often passed over in the books read by settlers, which cast the question as a simple binary of extinguished or not extinguished.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pub_purchased" class="analysis">
    <p>Purchasing land from indigenous peoples was a common theme in the published books. In addition to communicating to potential settlers the lands available west of the Appalachian Mountains, we found that purchase of land was also used to argue for the legitimacy of claims laid by the United States to land, as in the first example below.</p>

    <blockquote>The validity of the right of Virginia to this extensive western territory has been disputed by some, but without reason. The western boundary of that state, by charter, restricted by the treaty of Paris, in 1763, is fixed upon the Ohio River. She has <strong>purchased</strong> the soil from the Indians, has first settled it, and established wholesome laws for the regulation and government of the inhabitants . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Filson, <cite>The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of Kentucke</cite>, 1784</p>

    <blockquote>Notwithstanding the greater extent of soil <strong>purchased</strong> from the Indians in the west . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Brown, <cite>The Western Gazetteer; or, Emigrant's Directory</cite>, 1817</p>

    <blockquote>. . . the area included within its limits, having been <strong>purchased</strong> from the savages at the time of the creation of this territory . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Darby, <cite>The Emigrant's Guide to the Western and Southwestern States and Territories</cite>, 1818</p>

    <blockquote>The province of Virginia, in 1768, at the treaties of Lancaster and Stanwix, <strong>purchased</strong> the claim of the Six Nations; as did Col. R. Henderson that of the Cherokees, in 1775.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Dana, <cite>Geographical Sketches on the Western Country</cite>, 1819</p>

    <p>The quote below shows how the lands purchased from indigenous communities were often portrayed as a "wilderness", rather than as the home of many distinct communities of people.</p>

    <blockquote>. . . the whole country across, to lake Michigan is yet a wilderness, and recently <strong>purchased</strong> of the Indians.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Peck, <cite>A New Guide for Emigrants to the West</cite>, 1837</p>

    <p>The many references to purchases of indigenous lands attempted to legitimize westward migration of white settlers from the United States. As the passage above by American surveyor John Filson explains, a state's claim to land could be deemed legitimate if the land was purchased, settled, and governed by laws. In reality, purchasing the land was not so straightforward as these authors made it seem. Often, when land was sold, the ones selling it did not represent all those who lived on the land being sold; sometimes, a few members of a tribe would sell lands without consensus from the rest of the tribe, and sometimes, one tribe would sell lands belonging to another. Purchase of land was not the simple path to legitimate claim to a territory portrayed by these authors.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pub_fled" class="analysis">
    <p>Most instances of the word "fled" refer to indigenous people losing battles and running away. This one, describing the outcome of the American settlers' retaliation against the Shawnee for the allied indigenous victory at the Battle of Blue Licks in 1782, caught our attention.</p>

    <blockquote>The savages <strong>fled</strong> in the utmost disorder, evacuated their towns, and reluctantly left their territory to our mercy.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Boone, "The Adventures of Col. Daniel Boon; Containing a Narrative of the Wars of Kentucke," from <cite>The Discovery, Settlement, and Present State of Kentucke</cite>, 1784</p>

    <p>In Boone's narrative, the taking of indigenous lands by force is justified by the harms they have inflicted upon white American settlers. He frames event the Shawnees' abandoning of their territory as a permanent part of their declining influence in the area, later writing that due to his campaign, "Their connections were dissolved, their armies scattered, and a future invasion put entirely out of their power."</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pri_treating" class="analysis">
    <p>Treating registered as a word strongly associated with indigenous peoples in the private letters. We looked into the texts, and most instances referred to treating, as in conducting diplomacy, with indigenous groups.</p>

    <blockquote>After despatching Morris with letters to you, <strong>treating</strong> with the neighboring Indians, &amp;c, I returned to this place</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Clark, <cite>George Rogers Clark Papers</cite>, Vol. III (1771-1781)</p>

    <p>Several instances derived from Governor Harrison's title as Commissioner Plenipotentiary for Treating with the Indians.</p>

    <blockquote>a commission constituting me Commissioner Plenipotentiary for <strong>Treating</strong> with the Indians northwest of the Ohio</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. I (1800-1811)</p>

    <p>Occasionally, instances of the word treating referred to treatment of indigenous people.</p>

    <blockquote>Governor Harrison during this last effort to open a negotiation, which was sufficient to show his wish for an accommodation, resolved no longer to hesitate in <strong>treating</strong> the Indians as enemies.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. I (1800-1811)</p>

    <p>The presence of treating among the significant collocates in the private letters indicates the importance to American settlers and governments of diplomacy with indigenous groups. Settler communities and indigenous communities co-existed west of the Appalachians—often horrifyingly violently, and never simply. It was not the clean-cut image often depicted in our published books, of indigenous communities ceding their lands and leaving for American settlers to move in. Tellingly, the published books contain ten instances of the word "treating," but none of them are "treating" in the sense of diplomacy, as was the most common usage in the private letters.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pri_neighboring" class="analysis">
    <p>Often discussed in private letters were neighboring tribes and groups of indigenous peoples. Sometimes, these mentions were mainly descriptive, such as in the first example.</p>

    <blockquote>Those Indians used to visit and return visits with the <strong>neighboring</strong> whites on the opposite side of the river.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Clark, <cite>George Rogers Clark Papers</cite>, Vol. III (1771-1781)</p>

    <p>However, particularly in the letters of Goveror Harrison, mentions of neighboring tribes conveyed a great deal of urgency and importance.</p>

    <blockquote>We consider the acquisition of Louisiana highly important, not only to the interest of the western people, but to the United States in general. While it has greatly enlarged our boundary, it has secured to us the peace and friendship of the <strong>neighboring</strong> Indian tribes, and removed a danger justly to be apprehended, from its being possessed by a powerful and ambitious European nation.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. I (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>A restless and dissatisfied disposition has manifested itself among some of the <strong>neighboring</strong> tribes, and a few individuals are believed to be decidedly hostile.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. I (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>It gives me great pleasure to inform you, gentlemen, that there is every prospect of a continuance of that harmony and good understanding with our Indian <strong>neighbors</strong> which is so mutually beneficial and which it has been my constant endeavor to preserve.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. I (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>As the late murders upon the frontiers of this and the neighboring Territories leave us little to hope of our being able to avoid a war with the <strong>neighboring</strong> tribes of Indians . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. II (1812-1816)</p>

    <p>Discussion of neighboring tribes expressed the importance and urgency of understanding and managing the messy relations between settler communities and indigenous communities. The term "neighboring" contained within itself an acknowledgement of the existing and continuing inhabitancy and proximity of indigenous communities to the settlers. Governor Harrison's letters in particular emphasize how crucial neighboring indigenous communities were to a delicate balance west of the Appalachians: securing their peace and friendship not only lessened the danger of settler-native violence but also removed the danger of ambitious European nations, whereas hostilities escalated to wars. In contrast, our published books contain no instances of the word "neighboring" that refer to indigenous communities neighboring settler communities.</p>
