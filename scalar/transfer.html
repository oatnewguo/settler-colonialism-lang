  <p>From our investigations into our collocation analysis, and from our close readings, we argue the following. <strong>In comparison to our corpus of private letters, the published books we examined</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>contain proportionally more characterizations of indigenous peoples disappearing,</li>
    <li>present less evidence of their current and continuing presence in the region, and</li>
    <li>de-legitimize to a greater extent their indigeneity and their right to land.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We can begin to trace this in our verb collocates. Let's take another look at them.</p>

  <p>Notice that in these lists of verbs most significantly associated with indigenous people, 8 out of 30 are in the past or past participle tense in the published books, compared with only 4 out of 30 in the private letters. Many of these are verbs referring to the disappearance of indigenous people, such as "extinguished," "purchased," "fled," and "resided." In numerous cases, these verbs painted <strong>an over-simplistic picture of settler colonization</strong>, one in which <strong>indigenous lands were ceded, sold, conquered, or simply abandoned as the indigenous populations inhabiting them left or disappeared</strong>.</p>
  <p>In contrast, in the published books, just 2 out of 30 verbs are gerunds—words ending with "-ing," implying a continued action or state of being—while in the private letters, 4 out of 30 are gerunds. That's twice as many, and they express not only the continuing inhabitancy of indigenous people—as with "residing" and "inhabiting," which are in fact significant words in the corpus of published books as well—but also the <strong>continuing difficulty and urgency</strong> of the existing situation in which settler colonizers lived next to indigenous communities, one that required <strong>constant diplomacy and understanding of messy settler-indigenous relations</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Narrative transfer (II)</h2>
  <div class="quotebox">
    <blockquote><strong>Narrative transfer (II):</strong> when a "tide of history" rationale is invoked to deny legitimacy to ongoing indigenous presences and grievances. This transfer focuses on "fatal impacts", on indigenous discontinuity with the past, and typically expresses regret for the inevitable "vanishing" of indigenous people. If they have had their last stand, if their defeat is irretrievably located in the past, their activism in the present is perceived as illegitimate.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Veracini, <cite>Settler Colonialism: A Theoretical Overview</cite>, 2010</p>
  </div>
  <p> By the strategy of narrative transfer (II), settler colonizers distinguish a past that included an indigenous presence from a postcolonial present in which indigenous people have disappeared. While the current presence of indigenous communities was certainly well-known to most white Americans between 1771 and 1837 and could not be wholly erased in this way, narrative transfer (II) worked in nuanced ways in our published books to deny legitimacy to indigenous presences and grievances. In particular, we discovered that our published books depicted the vanishing of indigenous people as an inevitable, ongoing, and natural process. In doing so, they also often claimed that indigenous people had simply vanished, whether by disease, violence, or migration, from specific areas of land they had once inhabited. The portrayals of the western frontier that these books presented to readers were ones in which great quantities of land were newly empty and unclaimed for white Americans to settle, and more lands would be available in the future as indigenous people vanished.</p>
  <h3>Vanishing by treaty</h3>
  <div class="quotebox">
    <blockquote>The Indian title, by various treaties, has been extinguished to about 70,000 square miles . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Brown, <cite>The Western Gazetteer; or, Emigrant's Directory</cite>, 1817</p>

    <blockquote>When the Indian claims are extinguished, this state will possess 28,480,000 acres of land . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Darby, <cite>The Emigrant's Guide to the Western and Southwestern States and Territories</cite>, 1818</p>

    <blockquote>After the establishment of peace by General Wayne, at Greenville, in 1795, at which time large tracts of land were ceded to the United States, nearly all the Indians who resided on the lands, to which their claims were extinguished, retread back, and found new places of residence.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>A Topographical Description of the State of Ohio, Indiana Territory, and Louisiana</cite>, 1812</p>
  </div>
  <p>Often, in our published books, indigenous people were described as vanishing as they ceded or sold their land in treaties with the United States. Sometimes, these descriptions were straightforward, as in the first quote above. Sometimes, they particularly emphasized the amount of land for sale, or the inevitable future availability of more land, both present in the second. Other times, these descriptions emphasized the supposed neatness with which these land transfers took place; in the third passage above, American officer Jervis Cutler claims that "nearly all" indigenous people who resided on lands ceded after the loss of the Northwest Indian War simply left and found new homes.</p>
  <p>While it is true that a large quantity of indigenous lands were signed away to the United States in treaties, this was by no means as simple a process as one would have gleaned from our books. Indigenous representatives who ceded land to the United States at treaties often did not have the recognized authority to speak for all indigenous people who inhabited that land. And many indigenous people did not recognize the authority of treaty documents to deny them their right to land. As a result, transfers of land did not consist simply, as these books often portrayed, of negotiation followed by indigenous people leaving and settlers arriving. Take this excerpt from one of William Henry Harrison's letters to the Secretary of War, in which he refers to a murder committed by settlers on three indigenous people:</p>

  <div class="quotebox">
    <blockquote>Whenever I have ascertained that the Indian boundary line has been encroached on by the white people I have caused the Intruders to withdraw. But as the boundary line seperating the Indian land from that to which the title has been extinguished has not been run nor the manner in which it is to run precisely ascertained either at this place or in the country on the Mississippi called the Illinois it is impossible to tell when encroachments are made on the Indians at those two places.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and Letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. III (1800-1811)</p>
  </div>

  <p>As Harrison's letter shows, the border was a place fraught with violence and uncertainty. Borders frequently changed, and it took time and money to "run" them. Especially near borders, horrific violence was committed by indigenous people and settlers alike, and it was often impossible to tell who was encroaching on whose land. In reality, though our published books advertised vast expanses of unclaimed land gained from treaties for white Americans to settle, treaties were neither so legitimate nor so effective as they were made to seem.</p>
