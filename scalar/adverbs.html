  <div id="pub_formerly" class="analysis">
    <p>The word "formerly" appears numerous times in passages about indigenous people. It is most often related to the decline of an indigenous population, frequently caused by disease, as below.</p>

    <blockquote>They were <strong>formerly</strong> more numerous, but the small pox has made its ravages among them.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>A topographical description of the state of Ohio, Indiana territory, and Louisiana</cite> (1812)</p>

    <blockquote>They were <strong>formerly</strong> a very numerous and powerful nation, but are much reduced.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Cutler, <cite>A topographical description of the state of Ohio, Indiana territory, and Louisiana</cite> (1812)</p>

    <blockquote>Natchitoches tribe <strong>formerly</strong> numerous and much attached to the French . . . They have been reduced by war and small pox to about 30 souls . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Brown, <cite>The western gazetteer; or, emigrant's directory</cite> (1817)</p>

    <p>Sometimes, the decline is caused by violence, whether from European nations or other indigenous groups. Interestingly enough, none of the instances of "formerly" in out published books relate the United States or American settlers directly to a decline in an indigenous population.</p>

    <blockquote><strong>Formerly</strong> there were several Indian tribes situated on the western side of this Lake; and the Ontaonais occupied the other side: but the Iroquois, a fierce, bloody, and restless tribe, have long since dispossessed them.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Evans, <cite>Evans's pedestrious tour of four thousand miles</cite> (1818)</p>

    <blockquote>The Natches Indians, <strong>formerly</strong> a powerful, and, in many respects, a civilized people, were exterminated by the French in 1730.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Evans, <cite>Evans's pedestrious tour of four thousand miles</cite> (1818)</p>

    <p>The following example, rather different from the others, asserts that Kentucky was home to a civilization of white Europeans before the current indigenous inhabitants.</p>

    <blockquote>There are several ancient remains in Kentucke, which seem to prove, that this country was <strong>formerly</strong> inhabited by a nation farther advanced in the arts of life than the Indians. These are there usually attributed to the Welsh, who are supposed to have <strong>formerly</strong> inhabited here; but having been expelled by the natives, were forced to take refuge near the sources of the Missouri.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Filson, <cite>The discovery, settlement, and present state of Kentucke</cite> (1784)</p>

    <blockquote>The burying grounds, which were mentioned above, under the head of Curiosities, form another strong argument that this country was <strong>formerly</strong> inhabited by a people different from the present Indians . . . it may perhaps be worthy of enquiry, whether these repositories of the dead do not bear a considerable resemblance to the ancient British remains.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Filson, <cite>The discovery, settlement, and present state of Kentucke</cite> (1784)</p>

    <p>By focusing on the decline of indigenous populations due to disease and war, white American authors portrayed indigenous communities as vanishing from their lands. The implication of this was that a great quantity of land that had once been inhabited was now open for settlement.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="pri_frequently" class="analysis">
    <p>One of the words frequently used in relation to indigenous people in the private letters was, well, "frequently." While the word was used in many different contexts, a common theme was the frequency of grievances between settler communities and indigenous communities, such as horse stealing and retaliationâ€”to the point where William Henry Harrison wrote that horse stealing and violence committed by Indians was "no news here worth communicating."</p>

    <blockquote>It was necessary to stop <strong>frequently</strong> at the Indian Villages, to have conferences with them, furnish them with necessarys, and engage a few to accompany us.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Clark, <cite>George Rogers Clark papers</cite>, Vol. III (1771-1781)</p>

    <blockquote>. . . the authors of all those falsehoods which so <strong>frequently</strong> agitate the Indians . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. III (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>The Indians <strong>frequently</strong> steal horses that they are unable to catch by shooting them through the upper part of the neck . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. III (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>For as our people will generally pursue the attacking party and it will be impossible for them to distinguish the several tribes the innocent will <strong>frequently</strong> suffer for the guilty . . .</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. III (1800-1811)</p>

    <blockquote>We have no news here worth communicatingâ€”the Indians in small parties are <strong>frequently</strong> seen, and they commit some depredationsâ€”their chief object appears to steal horses.</blockquote>
    <p class="citation">Harrison, <cite>Messages and letters of William Henry Harrison</cite>, Vol. IV (1812-1816)</p>

    <p>The private letters of white Americans living west of the Appalachians such as Harrison and Clark expressed the frequency with which interactions and, specifically, violence, occurred and continued to occur between settler communities and indigenous communities. This stands in stark contrast to the narrative of decline and vanishing pervading the discourse of the published books (see "formerly" in the table for published books).</p>
