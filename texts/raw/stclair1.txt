 Let us take a look at StSt. Clair's record while with the army, making use of his own too brief narrative where it will answer our purpose
 "Although I was, for a consid- erable time, suspended from command, I never left Gen- eral Washington nor the army, and, before the battle of Brandywine, I suggested to him a measure similar to that so happily executed at Trenton, and would have been at- tended with similar effects
 It had before occurred to him- self (who rarely indeed missed observing any advantage that could be taken of the enemy), and he then showed me General Greene's division in motion to put it into exe- cution, and desired me to attend him to General Arm- strong's quarters (about two miles from Chad's Ford, where the body of the army was posted) who, with the Pennsyl- vania militia, which he commanded, was to have had a share in it; but the Pennsylvania militia were not in readi- ness, and he was obliged to abandon the project
 It was this: while Sir William Howe was ascending the Brandy- wine, to cross it near Birmingham church, General Knyp- hausen had been left with a strong corps in front of our army at Chad's Ford, clearly to keep it in check until Sir 7

 William had made good his passage above; to carry or disperse that corps was the object
 Greene's division was to descend the river to General Armstrong's quarters, and that movement would be concealed from Knyphausen by the thick woods on the river's bank, and being joined by his division, cross the river there, and fall in the rear of Knyphausen, while the General, with the corps at Chad's Ford, should cross at that place and attack him in front, which would infallibly oblige Sir William to retrace his eteps: for the loss of that corps he could not bear, and it was certain he would run every risk to prevent it
" It fell out at Brandywinc fur otherwise than Washing- ton had hoped for, through false information transmitted by Sullivan to him
 That officer had been dispatched with three divisions to intercept Cornwallis, who was trying to reach the American rear, while Knyphausen should threaten the front by way of Chad's Ford; but, being de- ceived as to the real movements of the enemy for a time, was late in coming up and forming his line of battle
 While deploying he was attacked by Cornwallis, his troops thrown into confusion, and a retreat rendered nec- essary
 Thereupon, Greene brought up the reserves, checked the enemy, and covered the retreat
 The main part of the army being thus drawn away, Knyphausen seized the opportunity to effect the passage of Chad's Ford, which Wayne was unable alone to successfully re- sist
 The Americans withdrew to Chester, the next day to Philadelphia, and thence to Germantown, where, in a few days, they met with another reverse
 The British loss at Brandywine was six hundred, and the American con- siderable more
 In this affair StSt. Clair had a horse shot under him, and Pulaski, who served as a volunteer, showed such zeal and courage in collecting the scattered troops and covering the retreat, that, upon Washington's recom- mendation he was appointed to the command of the horse, with the rank of Brigadier-General
1 In the skirmishing that followed the battle of Brandy- wine, StSt. Clair had his share, but in the action of German- 1 Hildrelh, Vol

 town he had no part, as he had received permission to visit his family
1 Another object which this absence embraced, was to try and get a hearing before Congress
 In writing to Presi- dent Hancock on the movements of the army, General Washington took occasion to refer him to General StSt. Clair, " who has been constantly with the army for some time past," for fuller information
2 We find him with the army again in November, render- ing General Washington such service as he could without the command of a division
 The Commander-in-Chief, in a letter to the President of Congress, dated at White- marsh, 17th November, referred to him in the following terms: "As the keeping possession of Red Bank, and thereby still preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de- frise before the frost, obliges their ships to quit the river, has become a matter of the greatest importance, I have determined to send down General StSt. Clair, General Knox, and Baron de Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to endeavor to form a judgment of the most probable means of securing it
 They will, at the same time, see how far it is possible for our fleet to keep their station since the loss of Fort Mifflin, and also make the proper inquiry into the conduct of the captains of the galleys mentioned in the former part of this letter
" The report of the officers was to the effect that keeping possession of the Jersey shore at or near Red Bank, was of the last importance
 In accordance with this, rein- forcements were sent under the command of General Greene
* StSt. Clair shared in the trials and sufferings of the army at Valley Forge,4 and during the winter, at the request of 1 StSt. Clair s Narrative

 "Washington, in common with other of the general officers,- submitted suggestions for the reform of the Quartermaster and Commissary Departments, which, owing to the in- efficiency of General Mifflin, head of the former, and the interference of Congress in the latter,1 had been thrown into the most deplorable condition
 The reforms recom- mended by the officers were generally adopted, and Major- General Greene being appointed Quartermaster-General, and Colonel "Wadsworth Commissary, order was restored to their respective departments, food and clothing were obtained, and the clouds once more disappeared—to return later, blacker than before—for the Americans
 That he should succeed in keeping together an army under such circumstances, is evidence of the genius and tact and marvelous personal influence of Washington
 Phila- delphia being in possession of the enemy, the demoraliza- tion of the people was wide-spread, and, but for the timely assistance voted by the French government, it would have left but a few devoted patriots here and there to sustain the cause
 Sir Henry Clinton anticipated the arrival of the French fleet,2 and withdrew from Philadelphia in June, following the usual line through the Jerseys leading to New York
3 "Washington followed in pursuit, hoping to improve some favorable opportunity to strike a blow
 La Fayette, who was most zealously in favor of active operations, was given the post of honor, and instructed to press hard on blood
 Yet at this very time we are told, 'hogsheads of shoes, stock- ings, and clothing, were lying at different places on the roads and in the woods, perishing for want of teams, or of money to pay the teams- sters

 • The French fleet under Count D'Estaing arrived off the mouth of the Delaware, on the 8th of July
 The assistance rendered this season was disappointing
 * His army was about twelve thousand strong, and was not incum- bered with any except necessary baggage and provisions
 The rest of the baggage, and about three thousand Pennsylvanians who adhered to the royal cause, were sent around to New York by water

 101 that part of Clinton's army moving on the high grounds
 General Charles Lee, who had recently returned to the army, had opposed an aggressive movement, but thinking better of it, by virtue of his rank, extended his command over the troops under La Fayette in the advance
 On the 28th of June, "Washington sent word to Lee to attack the enemy, who were encamped at Monmouth Court House, and promised to support that attack with the whole army
 Upon advancing in accordance with this plan, he met Lee retreating
1 Sharp words ensued between the two Gen- erals, and the line was reformed by Washington's com- mand
 A sharp engagement ensued which lasted until dark, without advantage to either side
2 The British with- drew to Nevisink, and took up a strong position, from which the American General thought best not to attempt to dislodge them
 StSt. Clair participated in this engage- ment, and continued with the army without regularly assigned duties, until, restored by the vindication of the court-martial and the action of Congress, he was placed in command of a division composed of the Pennsylvania line
 The winter of 1779 found American affairs at a very low ebb
 Washington's headquarters were at Middlebrook in the Jerseys; Putnam was at Danbury, and McDougall in the Highlands
 This starving, suffering army was about all that was left of the "United Colonies," having organ- ized form, and it, owing to neglect and arrearages in pay, 1This led to an ill-tempered correspondence on the part of Lee, to his arraignment and trial on charges preferred by Wayne and other officers, and suspension from command
 Thus another of the Cahal was eclipsed
 Mifflin had been retired, Conway's resignation accepted, and ere long Gates was to meet with defeat and disgrace
 Even in these dark days there was a God in Israel, and virtue, though often sorely tried, was trinmphant
 2 The American loss in killed, wounded, and disabled, by heat was two hundred; that of the British three hundred
 But this march proved very disastrous to the British, as over fifteen hundred Ger- mans, who had been so pleased with Pennsylvania as to contract mar- riages or form other attachments there, deserted, and afterwards be- came good citizens of the commonwealth of the Penns

 which were attempted to be liquidated in worthless money,, was on the verge of dissolution
 Congress was only the shadow of a legislative hody; corrupt, without ability, without means, without power to levy taxes or to control the action of the Colonies
 In a word, there was no gov- ernment, and the lawlessness and injustice inseparable from such a situation were manifest on every hand
 This is clearly shown in the StSt. Clair MSS
 One of his corre- spondents, who had an invalid wife, was unable to go to Philadelphia because of the terror created by banditti who infested the country
 Pennsylvania was filled with dissen- sions
 There were the Constitutionists and the anti-Cou- stitutionists, jealous of each other, striving to get control of the State, whose strifes produced a condition of anarchy
 A few men like James Wilson, Edward Diddle, and Joseph Reed, are seen to rise superior to their environment, and patriotically struggle for a restoration of law and the forms of government
 Ifeed is chosen President, and henceforth during the war there is vigor in the Executive Council
1 The effect ofthis change on the Pennsylvania troops will be seen from the correspondence of StSt. Clair, printed in this work
 lie and other officers in the Pennsylvania line were stoutly opposed to the Constitution of 1776, which they thought defective, and as containing "principles unfavorable to liberty, which must inevitably, sooner or later, end in a tyranny of the worst kind;"2 but they regarded as impoli- tic all attempts to change it while the people were engaged in a contest with Great Britain, and, though anti-Constitu- tionists, their influence was given to the party of the Con- stitution as the party of law and order in a time of great danger
 This influence was sufficient to compel the Assem- bly to recognize and support the form of government under 1 The services of President Reed were so important to the cause at this period as to entitle him to a high place among the patriots of the Revolution, and condemn as ungenerous all attempts to revive the suspicion, one time entertained, of his loyalty to the Commander-in- Chief

 103 the revolutionary Constitution
1 We shall see that when the war was over, and StSt. Clair and Wayne were restored to civil life, they labored to amend the Constitution, but for some time without success
 The letters of StSt. Clair at this period show a manly, pa- triotic spirit, a freedom from captiousuess and ill-tem per rarely met with at a time when there was so much to com- plain of, so little to keep alive faith in the justice of Prov- idence
 In letters of the 5th and 6th of March, to Presi- dent Reed, describing the sufferings of, and the spirit of defection among the Pennsylvania troops, his devotion to the cause is made clear
 "I am sure," he says, " I need not press you on this head, but give me leave to repeat that it is necessary something should be done immediately, or there is too much reason to fear the dissolution of our part of the army
 No exertions of mine shall be wanting to prevent so great a calamity; and, though it is a misfor- tune to have come to the command of it at this trying period, if I can steer happily through it, and render any service to my country, I shall not regret any pains it will cost me
" The subordinate officers were, at times, almost mutinous, and the impatience of such splendid soldiers as Butler and Ilurmar would be injudiciously displayed in correspondence
 In the midst of all of the trials, St
 Ciair remained serene, and, by his kindness and tact, not only kept the Pennsylvania line from dissolution, but its num- bers in excess of others of the army
 It was from StSt. Clair's division the soldiers were taken to head the column that assaulted the works at Stony Point
2 1The first Assembly refused to appoint a Council, and in that body, in 1778, there was an active minority pledged to a change in the form of government
 They refused to take the oath except with the reser- vation that it was not to prevent the adoption of measures for calling a Convention to change the Constitution
 A resolution was adopted to submit the question to the people, but that resolution was the cause of the defeat of the scheme
 Before the time fixed for the election, the Assembly, which had met in February, 1779, had received so many remonstrances from the people as to be influenced to rescind the reso- lution providing for the election by an almost unanimous vote

 The story of that most brilliant exploit of the War of Independence is familiar to every reader, and need not be repeated here
 Immediately upon receipt of the pleasing intelligence of the success of the assault, StSt. Clair congrat- ulated his friend General Wayne and those who shared in the glory
 StSt. Clair's correspondence with General Washington will show that his division held the post of honor through- out 1780, and that his services were arduous and valuable
 Detachments of the enemy having crossed over from Staten Island on the ice to the Jersey shore, and entered Eliza- bethtown and Newark on the night of the 25th of Janu- ary, surprised the small garrison,1 captured four officers and sixty privates, burnt several buildings, and plundered the inhabitants, General Washington directed General StSt. Clair to repair to the lines and make a thorough investiga- tion into the causes of the " misfortune and disgrace
" He also instructed him to endeavor to find out whether it would be possible to retaliate upon the enemy
 On this latter head StSt. Clair ascertained that the British garrison on Staten Island had been reinforced so that it was two thousand strong, and that so long as there was an easy passage between the Island and the city a successful offen- sive operation from the Jersey shore was impracticable, as was shown when Lord Stirling attempted a surprise on the loth
 He suggested that the intercourse between the in- habitants of Jersey and the British on the Island should he stopped
 The disgraceful surprise at Newark and Eliza- ant-Colonel Lewis Fleury, a very brave French soldier, whose defense of Fort Mifllin is known to every reader of American history, the right
 At the head of each was a forlorn hope of twenty mon
 Lien- tenant James Gibbons, of the Sixth Pennsylvania regiment, com- manded that under Colonel Flenry, and entered the work with three men, having lost seventeen
 Lientenant Knox, of the Ninth Penn- sylvania, led the other, under Colonel Butler, and was more fortunate in saving his men
 Lientenant-Colonel Meigs, who commanded the Eastern troops in the assault, was destined to come forward more prominently, though not more gallantly, in the future

 105 beth was due to negligence in not having a patrol out at the proper time
 Early in March, Major-General StSt. Clair and Lieutenant- Colonels Edward Carrington and Alexander Hamilton were authorized to meet commissioners on the part of the en- emy for the purpose of settling a general cartel for an ex- change of prisoners
 
 The British government having failed to obtain additional recruits in Germany, Sir Henry Clinton was instructed to use all available means for effect- ing an exchange of all of the prisoners
 There were those who entertained hopes that, under the pressure of their necessities, the enemy would make a just recognition of the independence of the Colonies in an honorable exchange, but Washington was not one of these
 His instructions to the commissioners were to "transact nothing but upon principles of perfect equality, and on a national ground
" When the commissioners met at Amboy, it was soon as- certained that the enemy would not treat on mutual ground, and the American commissioners at once put an end to the negotiation
1 Afterwards, there was an informal conversation as to an exchange on admissable terms, and, after separation, this discussion was continued, in an in- teresting correspondence, by General St
 Chiir, on the part of the Americans, and Major-General Phillips, on that of the British
 Courtesies, as to individual officers, were ex- tended on both sides, and something accomplished towards a better understanding
 In the movements to check Sir Henry Clinton, after his return to the North from victorious fields in Georgia and South Carolina; and in the discussion of plans for the re- duction of New York and Canada, in conjunction with the French allies, StSt. Clair had his full share
 A reference to "Observations " on the situation, submitted to the Comman- der-in-Chief, will show how thoroughly he understood the situation, and the conservative character of his opinions
 When the country was startled by the treason of Arnold, General Washington immediately directed General StSt. Clair 1 The report of the commissioners was communicated by Washing- ton to Congress, on the 31st March

 to take the command at "West Point, and to put the several posts in a state of defense to guard against a possible move- ment by the enemy
 It became his sad duty, as a member of the Court to try Major Andre, the victim of Arnold's treason, to declare that that meritorious and virtuous offi- cer had incurred the penalty of death
1 Undoubtedly it had been Washington's intention to leave StSt. Clair in command at West Point and the district on the east side of the North River, but Greene asked for it, and it was never the policy of Washington to deny him any thing
2 A re-arrangement of troops became necessary
 Greene was given two divisions, consisting of Jersey, New York, and New England troops, and was requested to march and relieve the Pennsylvania line as expeditiously as possible
 "StSt. Clair waits till he is relieved by a Mnjor- General," wrote Washington, and he "is directed to move the second Pennsylvania brigade and Meig's regiment to lThe Court to try Andre was composed of Generals Greene, Stirling, StSt. Clair, La Fayette, Howe, Steuben, Parsons, James Clinton, Knox, Glover, Puttprson, Hand, Iluntington, Stark, and Lawrence
 General Greene was made President
 A solemn stillness fell upon these officers as the young and graceful Adjutant-General of the British Army was ushered into their presence
 "It is not possible to save him, and yet we would gladly save him
" said Stenben, after the verdict
 How could it be done? The brave young man, scorning a lie or subterfuge, promptly denied that he had entered the American lines under protec- tion of a flag, and so each member of the Court, under military law, was constrained to pronounce jndgment in these words: "He (Andre) is to be considered a spy, and according to the laws and usages of na- tions ought to suffer death
" 2Greene to Washington: "A new disposition of the army going to be made, and an officer appointed to the command of West Point and the district on the east side of the North River, I take the liberty just to intimate my inclination for the appointment
 Your Excellency will jndge of the propriety, and determine as the
 honor of the army and the good of the service may require
 I hope there is nothing in- delicate or improper in the application," and therenpon proceeded to show that the freedom of the country and Washington's reputation nnd glory were inseparably connocterl
 Greene was as accomplished as a courtier as a soldier

 107 the army, as soon as a sufficient corps arrives to replace them
"1 In the preceding month, however, "Washington had paid StSt. Clair a handsome compliment, in offering to him the command of the Corps of Light Infantry2 which was be- ing organized
 He had formed a plan to attack New York upon Sir Henry Clinton's departure for Rhode Island, a scheme in which La Fayette took a deep interest
 "The command of it for the campaign," said Washington, "is promised to the Marquis de La Fayette, for reasons which I dare say will be to you obvious and satisfactory
 If we attack Xew York, the part which this corps will take will make it a most desirable command
 Should it be agreeable to you to take it until the return of this gentleman, which is uncertain, it would give me great pleasure
 I wish you, however, to consult your delicacy, and determine without the least restraint
" The offer, said StSt. Clair, a quarter of a century later, in his reminiscences, " was most joyfully accepted, nor could he have contrived to have done me a more grateful favor, nor in a more gracious manner
 The sudden return of Sir Henry prevented the attempt, and the Marquis soon after returned to his command
" About this time, a serious cause of embarrassment arose in the Pennsylvania line, which threatened to put an end to the long-time friendship between Generals StSt. Clair and Wayne, and leave the regiments without officers

 The first brigade of the Pennsylvania line had marched to join the army some days before
 *" The Corps of Light Infantry consisted of six battalions, each com- posed of eight companies selected from the different lines of the army
 These battalions were arranged in two brigades, one of which was commanded by General Hand, and the other by General Poor
 The Light Infantry was stationed in advance of the main army
"—Sparks
 3 " There is a matter now in the Pennsylvania line, which originated by the appointment of Major McPherson to the command of one of the Light Infantry battalions, that I fear will be attended with some serious and disagreeable consequences between General StSt. Clair and General Wayne

 McPherson, a meritorious officer, had been appointed to the command of a corps detached from the Pennsylvania line, by General Washington
 This gave great offense to the officers in line of promotion, and they had the sympathetic support of Generals Wayne and Irvine, and Colonel Rich- ard Butler
 Their resentment extended to StSt. Clair, who stood loyally by the Commander-in-Chief,1 although in sym- pathy with his subordinate officers
 To Colonel Butler he wrote in persuasive, but earnest words
 He could not rec- oncile himself to the thought that so many brave, virtuous, and good officers proposed leaving the service of their country, and throwing their well-earned laurels to the ground, and sacrificing their future peace to a punctilio, He declined to ask Major McPherson to resign, and said that the Commander-in-Chief ought not to recede;2 but he suggested that the officers address a memorial to Gen- eral Washington, setting forth their grievances, and offering their services until the campaign was over
 This sugges- tion was adopted, harmony was restored, and the Com- mander-iu-Chief presented the matter to Congress
 The result was the adoption of new regulations, and the correc- tion of some of the abuses that existed in the army, which prevented the dissolution that threatened
 It is impossible for one at the present day, living in the midst of a vast and wealthy country, surrounded by inex- haustible supplies of the necessaries and luxuries of life, to conceive of the extent of the destitution and suffering of the Revolutionary army in the years 1779, 1780 and 1 General Wayne, who had aided in fomenting the difficulty, when he found that General Washington remained firm by the principle he had established, felt called on to vindicate himself, and thought the best way to do that was to insinuate that StSt. Clair was unfriendly to him
 This mischievous effort was properly rebuked by Washington, in a letter which will be found elsewhere in this work
 Wayne's char- acter was not as frank and manly as one would wish to meet with in so good a soldier
 He was envious, ambitious, and given to intrigue
 Sparks says: ''General Wayne and General Irvine had used all their efforts to quell the storm
" We are satisfied this is untrue, so far as Wayne is concerned

 There was no money, and no provision of law for taxation; the imaginary value of the paper issues was de- stroyed by enormous volumes of counterfeit promises to pay; the crops were poor, and other resources were un- available; extortion run riot and sucked up the life-blood of the poor, until labor could not command enough paper to buy the bare necessaries of life; those that had been wealthy were plunged into the depths of poverty, while the few corrupt became possessed of houses and lands
 With- out means, how could the army be fed and sustained in the field? If patriotism had sufficed—if it had been provisions and clothing and powder and ball, no army had been better provided
 But alas! this could only endure cold and hunger in camp, and bleed upon the field of battle
 "I can assure you with great truth," wrote General Irvine of StSt. Clair's division in May, 1780, "that many officers have lived some time on bread and water rather than take any scanty allowance from the men
" Whole regiments had spent the winter—the coldest for many years—without blankets
 Even Washington had about ceased to hope: "I see nothing before us but accumulating distress," wrote he to a friend
 "We have been half of our time without provisions, and are likely to continue so
 We have no magazines nor money to form them
 We have lived upon expedients until we can live no longer
"1 Said Greene, at that time: "The great man is confounded at his situation, but appears to be reserved and silent
"2 Out of this re- serve came plans for the future, and appeals which finally brought the leading men in the different States to the front again
 New measures for supplies were adopted; new financial legislation, not always wise, was devised; and bills were drawn on agents in Europe
 France herself, with de- ranged finances, and the accumulated wrongs of centuries threatening chaos, was America's salvation
 It is not surprising that out of this poverty and suffering there came revolt
 On the night of 1st January, 1781, the Pennsylvania troops, under General Wayne, stationed at 1 Rimsay's Life of Washington, p

 Morristown, broke into open mutiny, and after a struggle with some of their officers, in which cue was killed and several wounded,1 marched for Princeton under the leader- ship of a board of sergeants
 "Wayne furnished them with supplies to keep them from plundering, and with Colonels Stewart and Butler became a voluntary prisoner, hoping to obtain some influence over them
 The avowed cause of the mutiny was a difference- between the men and the officers as to the term of enlistment
 The former held that the enlistment was for three years or the war; and the latter that it was for three years and the war
 The men demanded, in writing, a discharge to all that had served three years; an immediate payment of all sums due; and that in future all who remained in service should be paid in real money
 This demand they purposed to lay before Congress, with arms in their hands to enforce it
 StSt. Clair aud La Fayette, who were at Philadelphia, has- tened to the scene and were admitted within the lines, but were not permitted to have any intercourse with the men, and were soon afterwards commanded to leave by the board of sergeants
 To prevent a further spread of the defection, General StSt. Clair proceeded to Morristown, and gave as- surances to the soldiers that remained of future considera- tion
 He directed them to be collected and marched to Persipenny; sent the remaining artillery and ammunition to Luckysunny, and then reported to General Washington,2 who approved of what had been done
3 Immediately after the revolt the British showed great activity, and Sir Henry Clinton sent a considerable force to Staten Island, whence two emissaries were sent to the camp of the malcontents
 These, however, were given up through the influence of two of the sergeants, bribed thereto by General Wayne, and were subsequently tried and executed as spies
 Meanwhile, a Congressional Committee, at the head of 1 Captain Billings was killed and Captain Talbot mortally wounded

 Ill •which was General Sullivan, accompanied by President Keed, proceeded to Trenton and opened negotiations with the sergeants
 The situation was truly alarming, as it was uncertain how far the defection extended to other lines
 On this account, "Washington abandoned his first formed purpose to proceed to Princeton, and, instead, resolved on severe measures
 He directed General StSt. Clair to proceed to the Pennsylvania side opposite Trenton and send for the Congressional Committee to meet him fora conference
 If there were no reasonable hopes of a compromise, then get the opinion of the Committee as to what policy should be adopted
 If coercive measures were decided on, then make ulterior arrangements for militia with President Eeed and Governor Livingston to co-operate with a thousand Conti- nental troops which he should send from the army
1 This painful course was found not to be necessary, as terms, which included the demands of the mutineers, were con- ceded by the Congressional Committee and President Keed
 These were communicated to General Washington by Gen- eral Sullivan, who assured him that no concession had been made that the critical situation of affairs did not warrant and justice dictate
3 Men and means not being forthcoming from the States, as promised, Washington put forth the most earnest appeals and resorted to measures which showed the desperate straits to which the cause had now fallen
 The recruiting was put into new hands
 To StSt. Clair he intrusted the work of fill- ing Pennsylvania's quota
 The order was loyally obeyed, although the field was more inviting
 The difficulties, de- lays, and vexations, will be found fully described in the StSt. Clair papers
 When finally enrolled, clothed, and equipped, the troops were sent to Virginia to join the Marquis de La Fayette
 StSt. Clair still hoped for active work immediately under Washington, and he confidently expected the command of lStSt. Clair Papers

 his own words: ""When the army marched to the southward, I was left in Pennsylvania to organize and forward the troops of that State and bring up the recruits that had been raised there

 After having sent off the greatest part of that line under General Wayne, and on the point of follow- ing them, Congress became alarmed that some attempt on Philadelphia would be made from New York, in order to divert General Washington from his purpose against Lord Cornwallis, and they ordered me to remain with the few troops I had left, to which it was purposed to add a large body of militia, and to form a camp on the Delaware: of this I immediately apprised General Washington, who had written to me, very pressingly, to hasten on the reinforce- ments from that State; informing me of the need he had of them, and, as he was pleased to say, of my services also
 He wrote again, on the receipt of my letter, in a manner still more pressing, and I laid that letter before Congress, who, after considerable delay and much hesitation, revoked their order, and I was allowed to join the army before Yorktown, 1"September 21st, 1781

 I waited on the President of the State of Pennsylvania at his house in Market street, and mot there Mr

 This conference lasted a considerable time, and in its consequences took up the rest of the day
 T gave it as my opinion that Sir Henry Clinton did not intend for this city; nevertheless, as the inhabitants are alarmed and uneasy, I agreed to the propriety of being prepared, although I lamented the expense such preparation would put us to
 I advised the placing a garrison at Mnd Island, and putting that place in posture of defense, and men- tioned the plan proposed tome by Mr

 113 but did not reach it until the business was nearly over, the capitulation having been signed in five or six days after my arrival
 From thence I was sent with six regiments and ten pieces of artillery, to the aid of General Greene in South Carolina, with orders to sweep, in my way, all tho British posts in North Carolina; but they did not give me trouble, for, on my taking a direction towards Wilmington, they abandoned that place and every other post they had in that country, and left me at liberty to pursue the march by the best anil•most direct route; and on the 27th of Decem- ber, I joined General Greene, near Jacksonburgh
" We get a glimpse of this march through the South in the journal kept by Lieutenant Denny,1 'and Greene re- cords their arrival at camp, at Round 0, on the 4th of Jan- nary, 1782, "weary from their long march, and greatly di- minished in numbers
"2 It' a tramp of two months through au uninteresting country had diminished the numbers, what was to be expected of service through the summer months on the bank of Ashley River? In September following, Lieutenant Denny makes this cheerful entry in his journal: "Our camp very thin; not more than three reliefs of offi- cers and men for the ordinary duties
 Hospitals crowded, and great many sick In camp; deaths so frequent, the funeral ceremony dispensed with
 Provisions scarce and very indifferent; the beeves brought from the back counties of North Carolina, by the time they reach the camp, poor indeed, and must be unwholesome
 Commissary's yard and slaughter place commonly short distance from camp
 Soldier going there in morning, about killing time, met his comrade returning in; asked how was the beef this morn- ing? Other replied that it took two men to bold up the creature until the butcher knocked it down

 StSt. Clair had been spared this bit of ghastly humor by returning to his family in the summer
 The war was vir- tually over, and he could return home with propriety, con- scious of having done his whole duty throughout the ar- duous struggle for Independence
 Before closing this chapter, however, we must refer to correspondence of an interesting character that passed between General Wash- ington and General StSt. Clair during the progress through Virginia
 The latter had written of his plans and the diffi- culties that beset him, and received from his ever-generous friend a most appreciative letter
 "The difficulties," writes Washington, "of which you speak are such as I feared, but such as I feel confident the resources of your genius will surmount
 


 If your attempt should fail, whatever may be the censures of the people at the moment, I doubt not that your character will eventually obtain that justice which I natter myself your conduct will ever merit—an instance of which you have already had in the course of the war
" "Nothing," writes StSt. Clair in answer, "could have been more acceptable to me than the manner in which your Ex- cellency has been pleased to speak of my conduct
" While StSt. Clair was engaged in closing up the accounts and furloughing the veteran soldiers, in 1783, the new levies, stationed at Lancaster, refusing to accept their discharges without immediate pay, mutinied and marched for Phila- delphia, for the avowed purpose of compelling Congress to accede to their demands
 The mutineers were reinforced by the recruits in the barracks of Philadelphia, and, as they marched to the hall where Congress was in session, they numbered three hundred
 Their demand was made in very peremptory terms, that, "unless their demand was com- plied with in twenty minutes, they would let in upon them the injured soldiery, the consequences of which they were to abide
" Word was immediately sent to General StSt. Clair, and his presence requested
 After hearing a state- ment of the facts by him, Congress directed him to en- deavor to march the mutineers to their barracks, and to announce to them that Congress would enter into no delib-

 115 eration with them; that they must return to Lancaster, and that there, and only there, they would he paid
1 After this, Congress appointed a committee to confer with the ex- ecutive of Pennsylvania, and adjourned
 The members passed through the tiles of the mutineers, without being molested
 The committee, with Alexander Hamilton as chairman, waited on the State Executive Council; but, receiving no promise of protection, on the 24th of June, advised an adjournment of Congress to Princeton
 The day after their arrival there, a resolution was passed directing Gen- eral Howe to march fifteen hundred troops to Philadelphia to disarm the mutineers and bring them to trial
 Before this force could reach Philadelphia, StSt. Clair and the Execu- tive Council had succeeded in quieting the disturbance with- out bloodshed
 The principal leaders were arrested, obedi- ence secured, after which Congress granted a pardon
 The resolution directing General Howe to move with the troops, gave offense to General StSt. Clair, who regarded it as an attempt to supersede him in his command
 Thereupon, he addressed a sharp letter to the President of Congress, who very considerately refrained from laying it before that body
 Explanations followed, showing that StSt. Clair had misconstrued the order, and peace prevailed once more

 CHAPTER V
 1783-1787—RETURN TO CIVIL LIFE—Loss OF FORTUNE—ENGAGES i\ BUSI- NESS—A MEMBER OF THE Bo
utn OF CENSORS—ELECTED A DELEGATE TO CONGRESS FROM PHILADELPHIA COUNTY—CHOSEN PRESIDENT op THE LAST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS—GREAT GIFT TO FREEDOM—HISTORY OF THE ORDINANCE OF 1787—STSt. Clair ELECTED GOVERNOR OF THE NORTH- WESTERN TERRITORY
 When General StSt. Clair got time to look into his private affairs, he found himself ruined financially
 The mill which he had left in Westmoreland for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of that part of the country, was found to be in ruins—an evidence that beneficiaries do not always icel themselves bound morally to make any return for favors voluntarily conferred
 StSt. Clair mentions having lost £20,000 on one piece of real estate alone
 The comforta- ble fortune, and the valuable ofliees, which were all his in 1775, and eight years of the prime of life were all gone— all given freely, and without a regret, for freedom and
 a republic
 In 1780, StSt. Clair was elected a member of the Council of Censors, a body provided for in the Constitution of 1776, and charged with the duty of inquiring whether the Con- stitution had been preserved inviolate; whether the legis- lative and executive branches of government had performed their duty as guardians of the people; and whether the (axes had been properly laid, collected, and expended
 The Council could call a new constitutional convention only by a two-thirds vote
 StSt. Clair was elected from the county of Philadelphia, and he had for a colleague that eminent citizen, Frederick A
 Muhlenburg
 The names of other distinguished friends are found on the roll of Censors
 From the city of Philadelphia, came Thomas Fitzsim- mons; from the county of Chester, Anthony Wayne; from Cumberland, William Irvine; and from York, Thomas- Hartley

 117 StSt. Clair was an active member of this body, participat- ing in the debates amI in the committee work
1 A large number of the reports of the minority were written by him, and they display a breadth of opinion and a familiarity with law and the principles of government highly credit- able, He was made a member of the committee " appointed to report those articles of the Constitution which are ma- terially defective and absolutely require alteration und amendment
"^ This committee adopted an elaborate report, drafted by StSt. Clair, and attempted to secure the passage of a resolution calling a new constitutional convention, but although their report was supported by a majority of the Censors, it could not command the necessary two-thirds
 Thereupon, an address to the people, setting forth the fact?, was issued by those in favor of a new convention
 There was a strong party feeling displayed throughout the sessions of this Council, but an examination of its labors does not come within the designs of this work
2 StSt. Clair was also elected to the office of Yendue-master of Philadelphia—an honorable, and very lucrative 'posi- tion, through which the public revenues were received at that time
 His transactions were with the State Controller
3 In the confusion resulting from revolution, there was a vast amount of property to be sold, from which the State de- rived a revenue
 February 20, 1T86, StSt. Clair first attended Congress, as a delegate irom Pennsylvania, and, on Friday, February 2, 1787, he was elected its President
 This was a recognition of the ability of the man, rather than the patriotism which made him a soldier of the Involution
 As the work of the session of 1787 was scarcely excelled in importance by the 1These names will be found always associated together in the pro- ceedings of the Council of Censors: Arthur StSt. Clair, Fred

 results of the labors of that other body, in session at the same time, which gave to America a Constitution, and es- tablished the Union, I shall dwell upon it at some length
 In the history of every country there are supreme events to which may be traced the influence that ?haped the des- tiny of the people for good or for evil: in that of the United • States, it is customary to refer to the Declaration of Inde- pendence and the adoption of the Constitution in enco- miastic phrase, as exhibiting wisdom and genius of the highest order
 But, whatever may be said of these, may be applied to the Ordinance of 1787 with equal justice
 Aye, more, the spirit of the Ordinance has conferred bless- ings in addition to those derived from the Constitution npon the citizens of the States erected under its provisions
 "Upon the surpassing excellence of this Ordinance," said Judge Timothy Walker, "no language of panegyric would be extravagant
 The Romans would have imagined some divine Egeria for its author
 It approaches as nearly to ab- solute perfection as any thing to be found in the legislation of mankind; for, after the experience of fifty years, it would perhaps be impossible to alter without marring it
 In short, it is one of those matchless specimens of sagacious forecast which even the reckless spirit of innovation would not ven- ture to assail
"1 As long as human government shall en- dure, the influence for good of this remarkable charter shall be witnessed
 It was the one really great act of legislation by Congress under the old confederation, and it was the happy fortune of Arthur StSt. Clair to be the President of the body at that time and have the opportunity to give to the measure his hearty support
 Let us take a brief survey of the provisions of the Or- dinance: It provides rules for the descent and conveyance of real and personal property; for the appointment of the Gover- nor, Secretary, Judges, and other officers of the territorial governments; for the adoption of laws for the temporary government; for the erection of counties; for the election 1 Historical Discourse, 23d December, 1837

 119 of a General Assembly after the growth in population to five thousand souls; and for the election of a delegate to Congress, to have the right of debate, but not of voting during the territorial condition
 It then says: "For ex- tending the fundamental principles of civil and religious liberty, which form the basis whereon these republies, their laws and constitutions, are erected; to fix and establish ihose principles as the basis of all laws, constitutions and governments, which hereafter shall bo formed in the terri- tory; to provide also for the establishment of States and permanent government therein, and for their admission to a share in the Federal councils on an equal footing with the original States," etc
, "It is hereby ordained and declared, by the authority aforesaid, that the following articles shall be considered articles of compact between the original States, and the people and States in the said territory, and forever remain unalterable unless by common consent
" The first of these articles secures religious freedom to the inhabitants; the second prohibits legislative interfer- ence with private contracts, secures the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, trial by jury, and of the common law iu judicial proceedings; it forbids the infliction of cruel or unusual punishments; the third declares that as religion, morality and knowledge are necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall ever be encouraged, and good faith ob- served towards the Indians; the fourth provides that the territories shall remain forever a part of the United States, pay their just proportion of the Federal debts and expenses, not interfere with the primary disposal of the soil bv the general Government, nor tax non-resident proprietors higher than resident, and makes the navigable waters free forever to all citizens of the United States;1 the fifth pro- vides for a division of the territory into States, and their 1Mr

 admission into the Union with republican governments, when they shall have sixty thousand inhabitants, on an equal footing with the original States; and the sixth declares, "there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude within the territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crime's, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided always, that any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may bo lawfully re- claimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or services as aforesaid
" Such are the beneficent provisions of this remarkable paper, under which States have grown to be great and their inhabitants more prosperous and happy than the world has ever before seen—provisions "unalterable and indestructible except by that final and common ruin which has overtaken all former systems of human polity
"1 Those relating to contracts, to the treatment of Indians, and to slavery-, are original, while the others are drafted from the Constitution of Massachusetts of 1780, and the Bills of Rights common to Anglo-Saxon governments
 But the whole are gracefully worded, and admirably adapted for the purposes of free government
 It was fortunate that the system was to be established first in a new coun- try, where there were no obstructive customs and privileges to be removed before its benefits could be fully realized
 It is true there were immigrants who brought with them opinions in conflict with the principles of the Ordinance, and inconsiderately sought their modification, in vain
* 1 Chatc's Preliminary Sketch, p
 17
 2This refers to immigrants from Southern States who located in Southern Indiana and Illinois
 The French residents nt St
 Vincents, and lit Kaskaskia and Cahokia, had been permitted to hold slaves by the King of France, and this permission was continued under the Gov- ernment of Great Britain
 Hence, when the Ordinance was passed, in 1787, slavery existed at the places named, and it was not interfered v ith under the territorial governments
 Some slaves were removed to the Louisiaiui Territory, but others were retained as indentured serv- ants
 Immigrants favorable to slavery, and the old inhabitants, united in memorials to Congress, asking a suspension of the Sixth Article

 121 There were others, however, with broader views of human- ity and the ends of government, who, attracted by the principles of civil and religious liberty incorporated in the fundamental law, came by thousands, grateful for the op- portunity to be bound by its covenants
1 The first of these, signed by John Edgar and others, was reported on May 12
 17%, by Joshua Coit, of Connecticut, to whom it had been referred, adversely
 ln December, 1802, a meeting of citizens of the Indiana Territory, held at Vincennes, and presided over by William Henry Harrison, resolved to make an effort to secure a suspension of the Sixth Article of the Ordinance
 A memorial was drawn up, and in February following, it and a letter from Mr
 Harrison were referred to a special committee, of which John Randolph- of Virginia, was Chair- man
 March 2, ISOft Mr
 Randolph reported the following resolution: "Resole*!, That it is inexpedient to suspend, for a limited time, the operation of the Sixth Article of Compact between the original States and the people and Slates west of the river Ohio
" This resolution was accompanied by these wise remarks: "The rapid population of the State of Ohio sufficiently evince, in the opin- ion of your committ e, that the labor of slaves is not necessary to pro- mote the growth and settlement of colonies in that region; that this labor, demonstrably the dearest of any, can only be employed to advantage in the cultivation of products more valuable than any known to that quarter of the United States; that the committee deem it highly dangerous and inexpedient to impair a provision wisely cal- culated to promote the happiness and prosperity of the north-western country, and to give strength and security to that extensive frontier
 In the salutary operation of this sagacious and benevolent restraint, it is believed that the inhabitants of Indiana will, at no distant day, find ample remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of emigration
" In March, 1804, Csesar Rodney, of Delaware—afterward Attorney- General of the United States—reported the resolution of a Special Committee in favor of the suspension of the inhibition for ten years
 A similar report was made in 180f>, by James Garnet, of Virginia; and in ISO", Mr
 Parke, delegate from Indiana, reported favorably on a memorial of William Henry Harrison and tho Territorial Legislature, praying for a suspension of the Sixth Article of the Ordinance
 But no action was ever taken by the House on these favorable reports
 Subsequently, General Harrison and his Legislature went before the Senate, and a Special Committee, consisting of Mr
 Franklin, of North Carolina, Mr
 Kitchell, of New Jersey, and Mr
 Tiffin, of Ohio, was appointed
 They brought in an adverse report, and that put an end to the efforts to destroy the anti-slavery clause of the Ordinance
 1 "On the whole, these articles contain what they profess to contain

 Not less interesting than the Ordinance itself is the ques- tion of authorship
 "Who possessed the statesmanship to draft it, and the political tact to secure its unanimous adoption? Claims have been put forth for different emi- nent citizens
 Thomas II
 Benton, Governor Edward Coles, and others, attributed the authorship to Jefferson; Mr
 "Webster, and a long list of writers, to Nathan Dane, , of Massachusetts, while a son of Rufus King claimed him to be the originator of the anti-slavery article
 New inter- est has been given to this discussion by a recent contribu- tion to the North American Review
 It is from the vigorous pen of William Frederick Poolc, and contains evidence of that thorough research for which the writer is noted
 lie fixes 
the measure of Mr
 Dane's responsibility, but, perhaps, gives too little consideration to the influence of others
 lie gives the chief credit for the formation, and the entire credit for the successful passage of the Ordinance to Dr
 Manasseh Cutler, of Massachusetts
 Dr
 Cutler was the agent of the Ohio Company, and, in July, 1787, attended Congress, then in session in New York, for the purpose of purchasing for himself and asso- ciates, a million and a half acres of land in the Territory north-west of the river Ohio, provided favorable conditions could be secured
 These conditions included a form of gov- ernment that would attract immigrants for its liberality
 Several attempts to secure such a government had been made, beginning in 1784, when Jefferson introduced a bill for the purpose of organizing the Territory, but each failed for want of the requisite number of votes
 There was lacking a directing and controlling mind, with the influence and strategy needed to carry such a measure through
 Mr
 Jefferson, with whom were associated Mr
 Chase, of the true theory of American liberty
 The great principles promul- gated are wholly and purely American
 They are, indeed, the genu- ine principles of freedom, unadulterated by that compromise with circumstances, the effects of which are visible in the Constitution and history of the Union

 Mr
 Chase refers to the slavery compromise, of course

 123 Maryland, and Mr
 Howell, of Rhode Island, had reported an ordinance for the tcmporaiy government of the Terri- tory Xorth and South of the river Ohio, out of which ten States were to be formed
 Its notable features were articles of "compact" between the original States and the Terri- tories, and the following: " That, after the year 1800 of tile Christian era, there shall be neither slavery nor involun- tary servitude in any of the said States, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted to have been personally guilty
" Subse- quently, on motion of Mr
 Spaight, of North Carolina, this clause was stricken out, only six States voting for it,1 and, on the 23d April, 1784, the ordinance was passed as amended
 It was a dead letter
2 Mr
 Jefferson, having been appointed Minister to France, retired from Congress
 One year later, Timothy Pickering, of Massachusetts, be- sought Rufus King to make another effort to secure an or- dinance prohibiting slavery in the Territories
 Accord- ingly, on the 16th March, 1785, Mr
 King moved that the following resolution be committed: "Resolved, That there shall he neither slavery nor invol- untary servitude in any of the States described in the re- Bolve of Congress of the 23d April, 1784, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been personally guilty; and that this regulation shall be an arti- cle of compact, and remain a fundamental principle of the Constitution between the thirteen original States and each of the States described in the said resolve of the 23d of April, 1785
" The resolution went to the Committee of the Whole, but was never afterwards called up

 Johnson, of Connecticut; Mr

 Smith, of New York; Mr

 Henry, of Maryland
 They tiually reported an ordinance April 26, 1787
 The third reading was reached on the 10th May, but no vote was taken, and final action was postponed
 The original draft of tlvs ordinance was found and communicated by Mr
 Peter Force to the Rational Intelligencer, August 26, 1847, and it contains little in common with the instrument that was finally passed on the 13th of July
1 There was nothing of the grund principles of freedom, of non-inter- ference in contracts, of protection of private property, of the importance of education, religion, and morality to so- ciety, which arc the distinguishing features of the Ordinance we are considering
 It did not contain the articles of com- pact, which were to remain unaltered forever, unless by common consent
2 This was the situation of affairs when Dr
 Cutler arrived at New York, on the 5th of July, to make that bargain with Congress for land on the Ohio
 He was a man of affairs, in the prime of life, and highly educated
 He had been a Chaplain in the Revolutionary army, and, in com- mon with other officers who had been paid off' in Govern- ment certificates, was in such circumstances as to be con- strained to exchange- these evidences of indebtedness for something immediately marketable
 The Ohio Company had been formed for that purpose
 Dr
 Cutler was a grad- kin, praying for the organization of a territorial government
 On the 24th of August, tho Secretary of Congress was directed to inform the memorialists that " Congress have under consideration apian of tempo- rary government of that district, and that its adoption would be no longer protracted than the importance of the subject and a due re- gard to their interests miyht require

 Poole says: "Tt had no resemblance to the Ordinance which passed on the 13th July
" This language implies that there was noth- ing in common
 But the provisions for temporary government; the appointment of officers; the formation of n legislature; the adoption of laws; tho qualifications of electors, and the benefits of the act of habeas corpus, and of trial by jury, are very similar

 He served four years as a member of Congress, and is described as a " person of stately and elegant form and courtly manners, and, at the same time, easy, affable, and communicative
 lIe was much given to relating anecdotes, and making himself agreeable
" lie was armed with letters of introduction, especially to Southern members, and soon was on intimate terms with the Virginia members—Richard Henry Lee, Colonel Cur- rington, and Mr
 Grayson
 Four days after his arrival, a new committee, consisting of Mr
 Carrington and Mr
 Lee, of Virginia; Mr
 Dane, of Massachusetts; Mr
 Kean, of South Carolina, and Mr
 Smith, of New York, was appointed to consider an ordi- nance for the Western Territory
 That was on the 9th of July
 A new ordinance, the Ordinance of 1787, was drafted, introduced, read, amended, and passed, all within four days
 The vote \ly States was unanimous, but one mem- ber, Mr
 Yates, of New York, voted in the negative? be- cause it was constitutional with him to oppose every thing of a practical character
 Very properly the question is asked: What was the in- fluence that produced the radical change in Congress, and secured the approval of such liberal principles? Undoubt- edly, Dr
 Cutler organized the victory
 The treasury was exhausted, and Congress was in a humor to consider plans for bringing the Government lands into market
 Princi- ples had been discussed, and it was possible to reconcile conflicting views
 The time was ripe for action, and Dr
 Cutler understood the situation
 His first move after mak- ing the acquaintance of members, would be to secure a committee favorable to his plans
1 lie could do this only through the President
 Accordingly, he went to General 1Colonel Carrington, a personal friend of StSt. Clair's, who had been associated with him during the Revolutionary War, as a member of a Committee to negotiate a Cartel; and, secondly, in the movement of troops through Virginia to reinforce Greene, was made Chairman of the Committee

 StSt. Clair, where it is reported ho bad a cool reception
 And here I must take issue with Mr
 Poole as to the reason for this, as that given by him is not consistent with the char- acter of StSt. Clair
 He says: "He found that General StSt. Clair wanted to be Governor of the North-western Terri- tory; and Dr
 Cutler, representing the interests of the Ohio Company, intended that General Parsons of Connecticut should have the office
 But he must have General StSt. Clair's influence, and found it necessary to pa)* the price
 From the moment he communicated this decision, General StSt. Clair was warmly engaged in his interests
" This is suspicion merely
 The universal testimony of all who knew StSt. Clair disproves the justice of it
 He was frank and manly, and free from any of the cunning or worldliness the statement of Dr
 Cutler would imply
 It is much more likely that Dr
 Cutler approached him first to enlist him in his land scheme, and was balked by the cau- tion and circumspection of the Scotchman; but when he spoke of the blessings of a free government over such a vast extent of territory, he engaged his sympathetic aid
 The committee was made to win, and the influence of the President of Congress in shaping legislation, we know from experience and observation, must have been great, and was essential to secure success
 There is a misapprehension of facts here, which ha3 given rise to perplexing and altogether unnecessary confu- sion, which a more careful inquiry may correct
 The anxi- ety of Dr
 Cutler will be found to have a more particular reference to another ordinance which, in a sense, was a se- quel to, and dependent wholly upon, the Ordinance formed for the government of the North-western Territory
 The two are essentially parts of the same history
 They have, in their origin such close relationship, that they must be considered as inseparable
 Without the application of the Ohio Company in that summer of 1787, supported by a declaration of the principles of government deemed essen- tial to attract purchasers of the lands, it is doubtful if a form of government so highly favorable in all respects could have been secured in that or any succeeding Congress

 127 The necessities of the Colonies, the enterprise of the men
 of the East, and the political convictions of leading char- acters, all combined to form and give effect to the Ordin- ance
 A year or two later the conditions changed
 Party differences became more sharply defined, and sectional jeal- ousies proved more obstructive than ever
 Who should be the head of the new government, did not enter into consideration at any stage of the legislation
 Before the passage of the Ordinance, the name of President StSt. Clair had not been mentioned in connection with the office of Governor
 On the 13tb of July he did not preside
 lie had gone the day before to New Jersey to visit a friend, and he did not return until two days after the passage of the Ordinance
 Only eight States out of thirteen voted for that instrument: Pennsylvania was one of the five not represented
 When StSt. Clair returned to New York, he was accompanied by General Irvine, one of his colleagues
 In a letter1 of the latter, written 19th July, and addressed to Colonel Richard Butler, he refers to the Ordinance which had passed two days before his return, and adds: "'Who the officers of that government will be I hacc
 not heard, nor in- quired
" If the name of General StSt. Clair had been can- vassed, or, if he had had any understanding with the New England people, as is alleged, it would have been known to a friend as intimate as General Irvine
 But, furthermore, we have his own testimony, which is of the best, to sustain us
 In a letter to the lion
 William I3
 Giles, he says that the office of Governor was, in a great measure, forced upon him by his friends, who thought there would be in it means to compensate for his sacrifices to his country, and provide for his large family
 But it proved otherwise
 lie had "neither tlie taste nor genius for speculation in land; nor did he consider it consistent with the office
" He declared the accepting of the Gov- ernorship the most imprudent act of his life, for he was then in possession of a lucrative office, and his influence at Lome was very considerable
 But he had the "laudable ambition of becoming the father of a countrj', and laying 1 IIS

 the foundation for the happiness of millions then unborn
"* All this, however, was months after the Ordinance had be- come an accomplished- fact, and Dr
 Cutler had returned to bis home
 
 Colonel Carrington was Chairman of the Special Com- mittee that reported the Ordinance for the government of the North-western Territory, and also of the Committee on Lands
2 Mr
 DanoAvas a
 member of both Committees
 A sharp opposition to the terms proposed by the Ohio Com- pany for the lands, developed after Dr
 Cutler's return from Philadelphia
 Some members thought Congress was asked to make too important concessions and too large donations for special purposes, in order to secure the sale of the rest of the lands
 This view is expressed in tho letter of Gen- eral Irvine before referred to
 While he had no objection to the mode of sale proposed, as it would sink the National debt, yet, he added: '; I confess to you, I am opposed to a pre-emption to any company or set of men, I think, on sound principles; and I hope to prevent this passing with that tail, however beneficial the body might bo without
 I have no idea in making a sale, to bribe a person to get him to take my commodity with another article of equal or more value

 129 Major Sargent Secretary, and General Parsons one of the Judges
 But why this to the Southern members when they were in favor of the contract from the first? This was on the 23d of July, ten days after the Ordinance had passed, and members were just beginning to cast about for officers for the new government
 The first measure passed by Con- gress, 23d July, was not satisfactory, and Dr
 Cutler sent a letter to the Board of Treasury explaining wherein it would have to be modified
 To bring Congress to terms, he threatened to leave New York and buy lands for his com- pany of some of the States
 This had the desired effect, and, on the 27th, Congress completed the Ordinance by ac- cepting the modifications proposed by the wily Doctor
 "At half-past three, I was informed that an Ordinance had members of Congress from the southward, who were in favor of a con- tract
 Having found it impossible to support General Parsons as a candidate for Governor, after the interest that General StSt. Clair had secured, and suspecling this might be some impediment in the way, for my endeavors to make interest for him were well known, and the ar- rangement of civil officers being on the carpet, I embraced this oppor- tunity frankly to declare that, for my own part, I ventured to engage for Major Sargent that, if General Parsons could have tho appointment of First Judge, and Sargent Secretary, we should be satisfied; and that I heartily wished his Excellency, General StSt. Clair, might be the Gov- ernor; and that I would solicit the Eastern members to favor such an arrangement
 This I found rather pleasing to the Southern mem- bers, and they were so complaisant as to ask, repeatedly, what office 'would be agreeable to me in the Western country
 I assured them that I wished for no appointment in the civil line
 "July 26
 This morning I accompanied Generals StSt. Clair and Knnx on a tour of morning visits and, particularly, to the Foreign Ministers 
 
 
 Being now eleven o'clock, General StSt. Clair was obliged to attend Congress
 After we came into the street, General StSt. Clair assured me, he would make every possible exertion to prevail with Congress, to accept the terms contained in our letter
 He ap- peared much interested and very friendly; but said we must expect opposition
 I was now fully convinced that it was good policy to give up Parsons, and openly to appear solicitous that StSt. Clair might be appointed Governor
 Several gentlemen have told me that our mat- ters went on much better since StSt. Clair and his friends had been in- formed that we had given up Parsons, and that I bad solicited the Eastern members, in favor of his appointment

 passed Congress, on the terms stated in our letter, without the least variation; and that the Board of Treasury was directed to take, order, and close the contract
 
 
 
 By this Ordinance, we obtained the grant of near five millions of acres of land, amounting to three millions and a half of dollars
 One million and a half of acres for the Ohio Com- pany, and the remainder for a private speculation,1 in which many of the principal characters in America are concerned
 Without connecting this speculation, similar terms and ad- vantages could not have been obtained for the Ohio Com- pany
" We have Dr
 Cutler and General StSt. Clair laboring to- gether for the creation of a government for the North-west- ern Territory, and both afterwards related to it, though in manner widely different—the one sharing in its benefits, the other in the labors of administration in a vast wilder- ness beset by such difficulties and perils as were calculated to test the stoutest heart—that could only be met success- fully by the highest qualities of character, and these StSt. Clair possessed
 Mr
 Poole says there have been traditions and positive evidence, in the form of autograph letters in the family of Dr
 Cutler, since his death, that he caused the insertion in the Ordinance of the following clause: "Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of edu- cation shall forever be encouraged
" And he contended stoutly and successfully for the grant of land for the uni- versities and ministry
 These provisions were essential to the success of the scheme of the Ohio Company
 Dr
 Cutler's diary is notexpliciton the different points
2 lie may 1 Tho "principal characters in America" failed to complete this part of the contract
 2 Dr
 Cutler says, that the bill for the government of the North- western Territory was submitted to him, "with leave to make remarks and propose amendments," and that he returned it with his observa- tions in the form of several amendments
 This bill was undoubtedly the one proposed by Mr
 Dane, and which was retired May 10th, as we find this entry in Dr
 Cutler's Diary under date, July 19
 "Called on members of Congress very early this morning
 Was furnished with

 131 have suggested the clause on contracts, as that had been in hia "line of thought," but that as to the treatment of the Indians was more likely to have originated with some one who had experience in treating with them, and there was no member who had had so much experience, or who had studied the questions so thoroughly as the President of Congress
 The anti-slavery clause has provoked the widest discus- sion, as it touched what has proved to be the sensitive nerve of national polities, and determined immediately the char- acter of the communities to he organized in the Territory
 Who was the author of the Sixth Article? Dr
 Cutler is understood to have said that he drafted it when in New York;1 but he was in Philadelphia, discussing the flora of New England, or moral philosophy, with the venerable Dr
 Franklin, wheu that article was drafted
 Mr
 Dane says: "When I drew the ordinance, which passed, a few words excepted, as I originally formed it,2 I had uo idea the States would agree to the Sixth Article, prohibiting slavery, as only Massachusetts of the Eastern States was present, and therefore omitted it in the draft; but, finding the House favorably disposed on the subject, after we had completed the other parts, I moved the article, which was the Ordinance establishing a Government in the Western Federal Ter- ritory
 It is, in a degree, new modeled
 The amendments I proposed have all been made, except one; and that is better qualified
 It was that we should not bo subject to Continental taxation, until we were entitled to a full representation in Congress
 This could not be fully obtained, for it was considered, in Congress, as offering a premium to emigrants
 They have granted us representation, with the right of debating, but not of voting, upon our being first subject to taxation
" 1 Jndge Ephraim Cutler, who had incorporated in the Constitution of Obio, the clause inhibiting slavery, stated in a private letter (No- vember 24, 1849) that his father, Dr
 Cutler, remarked to him, on being informed of this, that "he thought it a singular coincidence, as he himself had prepared that part of the Ordinance, while he was in New York, negotiating the purchase of lands for the Ohio Company
"— Poole, in North American Review, as before quoted
 3 We have shown that the Ordinance, drafted by Mr Dane, and aft- erward discovered by Mr
 Peter Force, bore plight resemblance to the Ordinance as passed July 13
 Dr
 Cutler says it was new modeled

Page 132

 agreed to without opposition
" It is of record that Mr
 Dane offered an amendment, which became the Sixth Ar- ticle, on the 12th of July, when the bill was up for a sec- ond reading
 But did he draft it with the proviso? Was he, in any proper sense, the author of it? I think not, nor of any of those original and striking provisions which mark the Ordinance as "one of the greatest monuments of civil jurisprudence
" In the first place, we have seen that the Ordinance which Mr
 Dane did draft, and which was left untouched after the 10th of May, contained no hint that he had ever even dreamed of such principles of government
 In the second place, the style of the Ordi- nance of July 13th is the surest refutation of Mr
 Dane's claim of authorship
 It bears no resemblance to his com- position
 Nor does Mr
 Dane, in his letter to Mr
 King, which is given at length in Spencer's History of the United States, show that he had an intelligent conception of the real nature and importance of the Ordinance; and no- where does he attempt to explain why the committee that had his ordinance in charge May 10th was discharged, a new committee appointed, and a new Ordinance, of widely different character, drafted and rushed through, all within four days
 We shall have to look further
 The explanation will be found, I think, in the prevalence of anti-slavery sentiment among the prominent statesmen of Virginia, at that period
 It was not until after 1808, the date of the suppression of the slave trade, when Vir- ginia assumed a new relation to the cotton States, that this sentiment became unfashionable in the Old Dominion
 In 1784-1787, the echo of the Declaration of Independence had not yet died away
 Jefferson believed slavery to be an evil, and drafted an article prohibiting it in all territory after 1800
 This future limitation was undoubtedly put in as an inducement to South Carolina and Georgia to sup- port the Ordinance
 The same policy was pursued in 1787, when the proviso for the rendition of fugitive slaves was added to the Sixth Article
 And this proviso aids us in determining the influence that secured the adoption of the
Page 133

Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair
 133 anti-slavery clause
 It clearly emanated from Virginia
1 On the committee were Richard Henry Lee and Colonel Carrington, of that State, the latter of whom was chairman of the committee
 Before them were the resolution offered by Mr
 King in 1786, for which their colleague, Mr
 Gray- son, had voted, and the report of Mr
 Jefi'erson in 1784
 They were familiar with, and doubtless shared in, the opin- ion as to slavery prevailing in their own State—that, while the institution ought to be destroyed, it would be danger- ous and inconvenient to make any sudden change in prop- erty rights
 Hence the clause for the recovery of fugitives
 In support of this the reader is referred to the debates in the Virginia Convention on the adoption of the Federal Constitution in 1788, and particularly to the remarks of Mason, Tyler, Madison, Nichols, and Henry, on pages 452 to 458 inclusive, of Elliott's Debates; and also to the re- marks of Mr
 Sherman on the rendition clause when under consideration in the Federal Constitutional Convention, in 1787
 Jfot only does the Sixth article contain language similar2 1 In making this statement, I do not forget the influence of Massa- chusetts men in creating a sentiment in favor of the prohibition of slavery
 Timothy Pickering, in 1786 devised a plan for the forma- tion of a new State west of the Ohio river—" the total exclusion of slavery from the State to form an essential and irrevocable part of the Constitution
" l And we have seen how he moved Rufus King to offer a resolution proposing a compact inhibiting slavery from the Western Territory
 But, after all, we are compelled to retrace our steps to Mr
 Jefferson's article, proposed in 1784
 2Compare the Jefferson article with that of the Ordinance as finally adopted: Jefferson's Article, 1781,
 "That after the year 1800, of the Christ Ordinance of I7S7—Sixth Article
 "There shiill be neither slavery nor invol- ian era, there shall be neither *knvr;/ nor in- untarii Hcrvitudr
 in Ihi futiil territory, othcr- roluntarf/ trrritude in any of the said Slntct
wi

" ing into the same from whom laborer ser- vice is lawfully rlulmed etc
 etc
" And yet, with these two articles before him, Mr
 Howard Gay, in re- futing the claim of authorship of the anti-slavery article set up for Mr
 Jefferson, says: "Nor was there any essential similarity in the two or- dinances
" Then as the language is identical in the essential part of this most important article, what constitutes authorship? (1) Howard Gay's " Bryant's Popular History United States," Vol

 to that employed by Mr
 Jefferson in 1784, but the proviso is the same in effect as the clause in Article IV
 of the Con- stitution
 Both the proviso and the rendition clause avoid the use of the word slave
 And on the very day the Ordinance was passed the Federal Convention perfected that clause of the Constitution relative to representation and direct taxa- tion, which adds "three-fifths of all other persons"—to- wit: slaves
 Is this to be attributed to accident? Does it not show clearly that these important clauses were decided on after conference between members of the Constitutional Conven- tion and Congress, as related by Mr
 Madison to Governor Coles
1 and should be regarded as compromises? In case of the Constitution, if the slave trade were to be prohibited and slaves taxed, escaping slaves should be delivered up to their owners
 In that of the Ordinance, if slavery were prohibited in the North-western Territory, masters should be allowed to reclaim their slaves
 There is one other point to consider in support of this view of the supremacy of Virginia influence, and that is, that Colonel Carrington, in presenting the amendments, 1"This brings to my recollection what I was told by Mr
 Madison The old Congress held its sessions, in 1787 in New York, while at the same time the Convention which framed the Constitution of the United States held its sessions in Philadelphia
 Many individ- uals were members of both bodies, and thus were enabled to know what was passing in each—both sitting with closed doors and in secret sessions
 The distracting question of slavery was agitating and retard- ing the labors of both, and led to conferences and inter-communications of the members, which resulted in a compromise by which the North- ern or anti-slavery portion of the country agreed to incorporate into the Ordinance and Constitution the provision to restore fugitive slaves; and this mutual and concurrent action was the cause of the similarity of the provision contained in both, and had its influence in creating the great unanimity by which the Ordinance passed, and also in making the Constitution more acceptable to the slave-holders
" The History of the Ordinance of 1787, p
 28, It may be urged, on the other hand, that as the Constitution was formed after the Ordinance, the clause in the Constitution relating to the rendition of slaves, as well as other provisions, was copied from the Ordinance
 But the testimony of Mr
 Madison as to the conference should be accepted as conclusive on that point

Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair
 135 which were adopted on the 12th, inserted a clause in the second paragraph to confirm the reservation made for the French and Canadian inhabitants at St
 Vincents and Kas- kaskia in the deed of cession of Virginia
 This was a mat- ter on which the Virginians laid much stress
 Other amend- ments proposed by Mr
 Carriugton related to the descent of property and the dependence of good government upon the diffusion of knowledge
 Hence, Mr
 Force remarked in his communication, to which I have referred, that it would ap- pear "that most of the principles' on which its wisdom and fame rest,' were presented by Mr
 Carrington
" This does not conflict with those facts Mr
 Poole lays most stress on; it rather confirms them
 The conferences between Colonel Carrington and Dr
 Cutler were useful in harmonizing the views of the South and New England
 Surely there was not one, but many authors
1 To complete the work so auspiciously begun, and to carry out the provisions of this Ordinance, on Friday, the 5th of October, 1787, Congress proceeded to elect officers for the new Government
 Arthur StSt. Clair was chosen Gov- ernor; James M
 Varuum, Samuel Holden Parsons, and John Armstrong, Judges; and "Winthrop Sargent, Secre- tary
 Mr
 Armstrong declining, John Cleves Symmes was afterwards appointed to the vacancy
 There was, as yet, no Congressional legislation for carry- ing into effect the Ordinance, and General StSt. Clair im- proved the earliest opportunity after the assembling of the first Congress under the Federal Constitution, to secure the necessary action
 In July, 1789, Mr
 Fitzsimmons, of Penn- sylvania, reported in the House of Representatives a bill, which had been drafted by StSt. Clair, for the government of the North-western Territory, which passed the House and the Senate without opposition
 This act gave the sanc- tion of the National legislature to all of the important pro- 1 For a full statement of Mr

 The opening chapter in the history of the North-west begins with the recital of the indomitable perseverance and heroic bravery displayed by the discoverer—John Nicolet
 Au investigation of the career of this Frenchman shows him, at an early age, leaving his home in Normandy for the New "World, landing at Quebec in 1618, and at once seeking a residence among the Algouquins of Ottawa river, sent thither by the Governor of Canada to learn their lan- guage
 In the midst of many hardships, and surrounded by perils, he applied himself with great zeal to his task
 Having become familiar with the Algonquin tongue, he was admitted into the councils of the savages
1 The return of Nicolet to civilization, after a number of years immured in the dark forests of Canada, an excellent interpreter, qualified him to act as Government agent among the wild Western tribes in promoting peace, to the end that all who had been visited by the fur-trader might re- 1 Nicolet has at last found an American biographer competent to do him justice, in Mr

 main firm allies of the French
 Nay, further: it resulted iu his being dispatched to nations far beyond the Ottawa, known only by hearsay, with whom it was believed might be opened a profitable trade in furs
 So he started on his perilous voyage
 He visited the Ilurons, upon the Georgian Bay
 With seven of that nation, he struck boldly into wilds to the northward and westward never before visited by civilized man
 He paddled his birch canoe along the eastern coast of Lake Huron and up the St
 Mary's Strait to the falls
 He floated back to the Straits of Mackinaw, and courageously turned his face toward the West
 At the Sault Sto
 Marie he had—the first of white men—set foot upon the soil of the North-west
 Nicolet coasted along the northern shore of Lake Michi- gan, ascended Green Buy, and finally entered the mouth of Fox river
 It was not until he and his swarthy Hurons had urged their frail canoes six days up that stream, that his western exploration was ended
 He had, meanwhile, on his way hither, visited a number of tribes, some that had never before been heard of by the French upon the St
 Lawrence
 With them all he smoked the pipe of peace: with the ancestors of the present Chippewas, at the falls; with the Menomonees, the Winnebagoes, the Mascoutins, in what is now the State of Wisconsin; with the Ottawas, upon the Manitoulin Islands, and theXez Perces, upon tho east coast of Luke Huron
 He made his outward voyagp in the summer and full of 1634, and returned the next year to the St
 Lawrence
 IIe did not reach the Wisconsin river, but heard of a "great water" to the westward, which he mistook for the sea
 It was, in fact, that stream, and the Mississippi, into which it pours its flood
 On the morning of Wednesday, July 9th, 1788, there was unwonted activity in the garrison at Fort Harmar
 The day was to be a memorable one, and care was taken that nothing should be omitted that could possibly add to the impressiveness of the occasion
 The soldiers' muskets had been freshly burnished, and the officers wore their newest uniforms
 At an early hour the distinguished citizens dwell- ing in and around Campus Martins, having donned their

 139 best attire, waited on the commandant, to be assigned their proper places
1 Old soldiers—brothers of the Revolution— were to meet again, and unite in the establishment of the principles for which they contended on the martial field, in a vast new country
 The day, like the common expec- tation, was bright and beautiful, and the waters of the Muskingum and Ohio, as they united and flowed peacefully towards the western confines of the new land, seemed to reflect the outlines of the hills and wooded shores more perfectly than ever before
2 And now the signal gun is heard announcing the ap- proach of the hero
 General Harmar, with officers and citizens, proceed to the landing, where they welcome Gover- nor Arthur StSt. Clair, as he, accompanied by Major Doughty, of the artillery, steps from the twelve-oared barge upon the shore
 The military honors are not omitted by his old companion-in-arms, and fourteen guns are discharged with 1 The settlement had been in existence all of three moons
 It was on the 7th of April, 1788, (occasion ever to be remembered by the good people of Ohio) that that noble Revolutionary soldier, General Rufus Putnam, and forty-seven others of the hardy sons of New England, disembarked from the "Mayflower," at the mouth of the Muskingum river
 Within these three months, forest trees had been felled, houses built, a stockade erected, a city designed, lands laid off, seeds planted, and grounds tilled—an exhibition of determination and intelligent skill never excelled in the history of the world
 Before the expiration of the three months quite a number of families joined the settlement
 Hence the orator on the 4th of July could, with propriety, address his fair countrywomen
 2 How tame does this attempt to depict the scene, after a lapse of nearly a century, appear beside the bright anticipations of one of the participators in the event of that July day
 On the 4th of July, 1788, the garrison and the citizens of Marietta celebrated Independence, and Judge Varnum was the orator
 He said: "We mutually lament that the absence of his Excellency will not permit us, upon this joyous occasion, to make those grateful assurances of sincere attachments, which bind us to him by the noblest motives that can animate an en- lightened people
 May he soon arrive
 Thou gently flowing Ohio, whose surface, as conscious of thy unequaled majesty, reflecteth no images but the grandeur of the impending heaven, bear him, oh, bear him safely to this anxious spot! And thou beautiful, transparent Muskingum, swell at the moment of his approach, and reflect no ob- jects but of pleasure and delight!"

 due precision at the Fort, where he is to remain until the formal opening of the civil government
1 Tuesday, July 15th, is red-letter day in the annals of the North-western Territory, for it was on that day that civil government was first established west of the river Ohio
 Governor StSt. Clair, attended by Judges Parsons and Var- num, and Secretary Sargent, made his public entry at the bower, in the City of Marietta, where he was received by General Rufus Putnam, and all of the citizens, "with the most sincere and unreserved congratulations
"2 "His Excellency was seated, and after a short interval of profound silence, arose and addressed himself to the assembly in a concise but dignified speech
" * He expressed his great pleasure at meeting them upon so important an occasion, and informed them that he had brought with him a most excellent constitution for the government of the Territory, to which he invited their attention
 There- upon Secretary Sargent read the Ordinance, and also the commissions of the officers, after which the Governor spoke at some length in a very happy manner on the im- portance of good government; of his desire to administer the trust confided to him in such manner as to merit their approbation; of the relations of the Territorial to the Gen- eral Government; of the auspicious opening of the new country, and of the necessity for the community to culti- vate friendly relations with the savages
 "The present situation of territory," he concluded, "calls for attention in various places, and will necessarily induce a frequent absence, both of the judges and myself, from this delight- ful spot; but at all times and places, as it is my indispens- able duty, so it is very much my desire to do every thing within the compass of my power for the peace, good order, and perfect establishment of the settlement; and as 1 There will be found included in the correspondence of this work an affectionate letter from General Harmar to StSt. Clair, from Fort liar- mar, Nov

 This was the happy beginning of fivo large States, which bave controlled to a greater degree than any other section the destinies of the Republic, and by the virtues of their citizens, the wisdom of their laws, and their faithful observ- ance of the compact which says "they shall forever remain apart" of the Union, have vindicated the wisdom of the old Continental Congress in creating the Ordinance of 1787

 At Au Post (Vincennes), Kas- kaskia, and Cahokia were French inhabitants and military posts which had been transferred to the British by the peace of 1763, and afterwards conquered for Virginia and the Continental Congress by the intrepid George Rogers Clarke
 At lesser points were a few adventurers, traders chiefly, but every-where else, over a vast country, the Indian was lord of all he surveyed
 Here had been the home of his fathers—he knew of no other; here his children had acquired that confidence that comes of undisputed posses- sion; food was found in the forests, on the prairies, in the waters, or in the cultivated fields of the Scioto, the Mad River, the Miami, the Auglaize, the Wabash, or the Illi- nois; there was such abundance as could be found no where else in the world
 Should he yield this without a struggle to the Long Knife—the intruder—and find his grave in the waters of the Mississippi? Won by the devotion and eloquence of the Jesuit Fathers, the Indians had permitted the French to erect posts on the lakes, on the rivers and in the interior without objection
 Nay, more, they welcomed the French because they brought them arms, instructed them in useful arts, and received their furs in barter
 The British pursued pretty much the same policy, but pushed the traffic for furs with more vigor
 Neither the French nor the British ever put forth a claim to the soil of the West,1 or sought to do more than to con- duct a profitable trade with the Indians from the posts
 In holding these posts despite the treaty of 1783, the British hoped for new complications; such change in the favors of 1 The British required the Indians to rleed to them the land on which the forts were erected and adjacent to them; but put forth no claim to the lands in general

 143 fortune as would preserve to them the profitable fur trade of the West
 Hence the commanders of the posts con- tinued on friendly terms with the Indians, and encouraged them in the opinion that white settlements west of the Ohio threatened the extermination of the red people
 The young men of the Indian tribes conducted a predatory warfare against the intruders, as they regarded the whites
 All along the borders, the venturesome pioneers were either killed or driven away, those surviving only remembering the momentary gleam of the tomahawk or scalping-kuife, from beneath some leafy covert, as the first or only notice of the avenging foe
 The red-men, while denying the right of the Six Nations to cede their lands to Congress west of Pennsylvania, and that they were bound as a whole by the action of a few chiefs at Fort Mclntosh, in 1785, and Fort Finney, in 1786, yet sought a partial justification for their bloody deeds in that clause of the several treaties, which declared that any citizen of the United States who ob- truded on the Indian reservations, should forfeit the protection of the United States, and be liable to punish- ment by the Indians
 There was a partial suspension of these depredations in the first half of the year 1788, and the friendly attitude of the Indians who came to Fort Hurmar led the inhabitants on the Muskingum to hope that they would cease altogether
 There was a determina- tion to do nothing that would awaken the animosity of the savages
 We shall see that this hope was doomed to dis- appointment, and that, after the confirmation of the hated treaties the following year, the chiefs put no restraint upon their warriors
 By the treaty of Fort Mclntosh, the Wyandot, Delaware, and kindred nations, had acknowledged the sovereignty of the United States as superccding that of Great Britain, and had sold lauds lying east, south, and west of a line drawn from the mouth of the river Cuyahoga to the por- tage between that and the Tuscarawas branch of the Mus- kingum, and to the forks of Tuscarawas above Fort Law- rence; thence to Loramies on the Big Miami; thence to the Maumee, and thence, with the south-east line of that river,

 to the lake
 In the following year a treaty was concluded with the Shawanese nation, at Fort Finney, by which title was obtained to a section extending from the fork of the Great Miami to the Wabash, on a line with the river De la Pause
 Laws for the survey and sale of such of these lands as were not reserved for the Virgima militia and Continental troops were passed, and intruders warned off
1 To pro- tect the surveyors and carry out the orders of the Board of Treasury, was the duty of Colonel Harmar's command on the Ohio
 The land was divided into townships, six miles square, by lines running north and south, and inter- sected by east and west lines
 These townships were again sub-divided, each section containing a square mile, or six hundred and forty acres
 The ranges were numbered from south to north, beginning on the Ohio river, and were dis- tinguished by progressive numbers from east to west
 In addition to the general claims of the western Indian tribes, above referred to, the situation was complicated by the extraordinary claims of the Illinois and Wabash Land Companies, and of the French settlers at Post Vincennes
 The latter, by virtue of Indian grants and court concessions, claimed a territory of about fifteen thousand square miles;4 while the Land Companies claimed even a greater extent of territory
 The French, on the Mississippi river, had not yet had their titles confirmed, as provided for in the grant made by Virginia to the United States
 American adven- turers had also taken possession of lands and formed a set- tlement in the vicinity of the confluence of the Kaskaskia and Mississippi, giving it the name of New Design
* These various movements and claims excited the jealousy 1 See Land Laws of the United States for the North-western Terri- tory
 The missionary towns of Gnadenhiitten, Schoenbrun, and Sa- lem, on the Muskingum, were given to the Moravian Indians surviv- ing the massacre; and three townships, on Lake Erie, were reserved for the use of refugees from Canada and Nova Scotia

 145 of the Indians, which was not allayed by the various treaties
 This was the situation confronting Governor StSt. Clair, when, after the impressive opening scenes at Marietta on the 15th of July, he set to work with the judges to form a code of laws for the new government, as provided for in the Ordinance
 'These officers did not strictly confine them- selves within the limits of their legislative authority, which was to make selections from the statutes of the original thirteen States
 When they could not find laws suited to the condition of the Territory, they supplied the want by enactments of their own
 This practice was acquiesced in by Governor StSt. Clair with great reluctance,1 and it will be seen, from his correspondence and speeches included in this work, that his conservatism and firmness saved the people from a good deal of unwise legislation
 The laws which were not adapted from the statutes of the States were not approved by Congress, on the ground that the officers were not authorized to enact laws
 Nevertheless, they (with two exceptions) continued in force in the Territory, because nec- essary to good government, until the second grade of gov- ernment was established, in 1795, when the Governor and Council formally enacted a code of laws
2 1 SiSt. Clair Papers
 Address to first Territorial Legislature
 2 This legislative authority extended from 1788 to 1795, at which time, the second stage of government having been reached, a General As- sembly was constituted
 "That the Governor and Judges, in the enactment of these laws, exceeded their authority, without the slight disposition to abuse it, may be inferred from the fact that, except two which had previously been repealed, they were all confirmed by the first Territorial Legislature
"—Chases Preliminary Sketch, p

 The vacancies caused by the deaths of Judges Varnum (January 10, 1789) and Parsons (1790), were filled by the appointment of George Turner and Rufus Putnam, respectively
 Judge Putnam served until 1796, when he resigned to accept the office of Surveyor-General
 Jo- seph Gillman, of Point Harmar, was appointed to the vacancy
 Judge Turner removed from the Territory, and resigned in 1796
 In his place Return Jonathan Meigs was appointed, in February, 1798

 The first law created provided for the organization of the militia
 The draft was prepared by Judges Varnum and Parsons, and presented to the Governor for his approval
 His criticisms on their work will be found among the StSt. Clair papers, and are sufficiently caustic to be acceptable to a modern reviewer
 The Judges had speculative views, and, unheeding a let- ter from the Governor inviting their attention to important points of legislation, prepared and presented to him an ex- traordinary " projet" for dividing' real estate held in com- mon
1 The Governor declined to give his assent in a digni- fied and able paper
 lie showed that great injustice might result to non-resident property holders through such a law, and that in that respect it was in violation of the spirit of the Ordinance
 This veto, following so closely after the criticisms on their essay at military legislation, disturbed the equanimity of the Judges, and they took advantage of a letter from the Governor, of the 1st of August, in which he asked them to give him the precise meaning they affixed to the word "Laws," as employed in the Ordinance, to de- clare the right and power of a majority of the Judges to enact laws without the consent of the Governor, and quoted this sentence from the Ordinance as their authority: "The governor and judges, or a majority of them, shall adopt, and publish in the district, such laws of the original States, criminal or civil, as may be necessary," etc
 They claimed that "a majority of them" applied to the Governor and Judges sitting as a legislative body
 The Governor replied in a letter that displayed keen an- alytical powers and familiarity with law and the princi- ples of government
 "I conceive, gentlemen," said he, "Congress thought there would be an impropriety in leav- ing the adoption of laws, by which the people of the Dis- 1 Atwater, in his History of the Slate of Ohio, falls into an error in say- ing that the Judges presented their scheme on real estate to the Gov- ernor before the passage of the militia law
 It was immediately after
 Atwater adds, with perfect justice: "This bill was so loosely drawn up that had it became a law, the non-resident owners of land, would have been swindled out of all their lands by the resident proprietors
 This projet was rejected by the Governor

 147 trict were, for a time, to be governed, solely to the persons who were to expound them; much greater, however, would that impropriety be if the clause of the Ordinance goes uot only to adoption, but to the formation of laws
 The Judges would, in that case, be complete legislators, which is the very definition of tyranny; and though that arrange- ment might, in your hands, produce no evils, no man can toll how long this stage of the government will last, or who may be your successors; nor could it fail to produce much uneasiness in the minds of the people over whom so (pos- fcibly) oppressive an authority was established
1" He said that he agreed with the Judges that the "clause in ques- tion, and every other clause in the Ordinance, should receive a liberal construction wherever they are in the least doubt- ful; and as it, in some measure partakes of the nature of a charter, is to be expounded favorably to the grantees; but it is one thing to construe a grant liberally, and another to add to the grant by construction that was never in the con- templation of the grantor; and this is precisely what I think would follow, should your opinion npon the clause" prevail
2 The legislative duties kept Governor StSt. Clair busy until the close of the year
 Beside the militia law already re- ferred to, nine other laws were framed and published, the most important of which were; For the establishment of inferior courts, including probate; for fixing the terms of the general court; for the punishment of crimes;3 prescrib- ing oaths of office; regulating marriages; prescribing the duties of ministerial officers; for appointing coroners, and for the limitation of actions
 In the law for the punish- ment of crimes, is a section for the prevention of profan- ity, and for a sacred observance of the Christian Sabbath

 half of the present State of Ohio, was erected on the 26th of July
 Officers for the militia were appointed
 The Governor also appointed three distinguished gentlemen, of whom we shall hear a good deal, Justices of the Peace, viz
, Rufus Putnam, Benjamin Tupper, and Winthrop Sargent; and, on the 30th of August, established a Court of Quarter Sessions, of which he appointed another distinguished citi- zen and soldier, Return Jonathan Meigs, Clerk
 Gen- eral Putnam was also made Judge of Probate, with Col- onel Meigs as Clerk
1 Latfs having been framed, civil officers appointed there- under, a county erected,,and the population having in- creased on the Ohio to one hundred and thirty-two souls, there remained, to complete the government, only the formal inauguration of the judiciary: with just laws, bench and forum, the liberties of the people would be made se- cure
 Tuesday, the 2d day of September, 1788, was the day set apart for this ceremony
 The account of an eye- witness enables us to enter into the spirit of the occasion, and to feel, after an interval of nearly one hundred years, something like a just appreciation of the greatness of the work of those Revolutionary heroes
 It is the duty, as it should be the pleasure, of all who enjoy the blessings con- ferred by the most liberal government, and equal and ben- eficent laws, to study the sources of these, and the charac- ter of the men who framed and established them
 They huildcd for posterity
 Then ever green be their memories
 On that memorable first Tuesday of September, the cit- izens, Governor StSt. Clair and other Territorial Officers, and military from Fort Ilarmar being assembled at the Point, a procession was formed, and, as became the occasion, with Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, Sheriff, with drawn sword and wand of office at the head, marched up a path that had been cut through the forest, to the hall in the north-west block-house of Campus Martius, where the whole couuter- 1 Other officers appointed were as follows: Additional Justices of the Peace, with power to hold the Court of Quarter Sessions, Archibald Crary, Isaac Pierce, and Thomas Lord; Clerk of tho Supreme Court, William Collis; Sheriff and Colonel of Militia, Ebenezer Sproat

 Prayer was fittingly offerred by our friend, the Reverend Manassch Cutler, who was on a visit to the new colony, after which the commissions of the Judges, Clerk, and Sheriff were read, and the opening pro- claimed in deep tones by Colonel Sproat, in these words: '; 0, yes! a court is opened for the administration of 
even- handed justice, to the poor and the rich, to the guilty and the innocent, without respect of persons; none to be pun- ished without trial by their peers, and then in pursuance of the laws and evidence in the case

 ing events on the Muskingum
 The affairs of the Ohio Com- pany had not progressed far enough to admit of the sale of tracts of land to settlers, and the General and his asso- ciates saw, with deep chagrin, the emigrants floating down the Ohio to the settlements of Kentucky
 "Upwards of seven thousand," he wrote, "have gone down since we began our settlement," and he was confident many of them would have staid on the Muskingum if they could have got lands
 Accordingly, notice was issued in August of a meeting of the Company, and when held, in the December following, measures were taken to give to settlers lots for improvement, and for the survey of the lands which fell to the share of members
 Meanwhile, a number of comfort- able log houses with shingle roofs, had been erected in the town, and the stockade and block-houses of Campus Mar- tius completed
 The south-west block-house was appro- priated for the use of Governor StSt. Clair and family1 who had also presented to him, by the Ohio Company, fifteen acres of ground in the town
 In the midst of all this toil there was not wanting pleas- ant social intercourse and diversions to relieve the pioneer life of much of its rough ness
 From the journal of Colonel John May, and other contemporary writings, we get a pleasing view of this life in the wilderness
 The great abundance and variety of game and fish, and the rapid growth of vegetables and fruits in the rich soil, was the cause of much wonderment, as well as of much satisfaction
 After the completion of the north-west block-house, the Directors of the Ohio Company gave a dinner (August 20) to Governor StSt. Clair and the officers of Fort Harmar
 The twelve-oared barge, that had done such signal duty before, brought the company, which included a number of ladies, from the Fort up the Muskingum to the landing opposite the new garrison
 At this dinner were produced some'peaches grown from pits planted by Major Doughty when he erected Fort Harmar in 1785, very line and lus- cious
 On the Sunday following (August 24) all of the inhabitants had the privilege of listening to a sermon 1 Mrs

 151 preached by the accomplished divine, Manasseh Cutler
 And three days later there is another memorable social event, which we glean from the journal of a friend whom we met in the South in the closing days of the Revolu- tion—afterwards more intimately associated with StSt. Clair— Lieutenant Ebeuezer Denny
 Under the date of August 27, we read: "Judge Symmes, with several boats and families, arrived, on their way to his new purchase at the Miami

" A gleam of sunshine in the forest
 The correspondence of Governor StSt. Clair, during these days, is chiefly devoted to business affairs, and to these we shall now turn our attention
 The instructions of Congress to the Governor rela- tive to the Indians, required him to hold a general treaty with the tribes inhabiting the country north-west of the river Ohio, and about the lakes, at such times and places as he should appoint, for the purpose of ascertaining the causes of uneasiness among 'them, hearing their complaints, regulating trade, and amicably settling all affairs concern- ing lands and boundaries between them aud the United States
 This business detained him during the winter for some time at Pittsburg, where he concerted measures with General Richard Butler, for bringing in the chiefs of the Six Nations, and of the western tribes, to the proposed Convention
1 After a correspondence with the Indians, it was agreed, in deference to their wishes, to have the con- ference held in what they were pleased to call their own country, beyond the guns of any fort, to meet at the falls of the Muskingam,2 and, accordingly, in the latter part of 1 StSt. Clair Papers

 June, General Ilarmar was instructed to send a detach- ment to that place to prepare a council-house and buildings for storing the goods to be distributed among the Indians
 The instructions were carried out, and such Indians as arrived were scut thither
 Unfortunately, some renegade Chippewu and Tawa Indians were among them, and on the night of the 12th July attacked the sentries and attempted to steal the goods they were guarding
 Two soldiers were killed and two wounded, but other soldiers coming to their assistance, the attempt was frustrated
 One Indian was killed and one wounded
 The friendly Dclawares, who arrived soon after, declared the dead Indian to be a Tawa, and they aided in the capture of a half-dozen of the ras- cals, who were taken to Fort Ilarmar in irons
1 It was afterward ascertained that the Chippewas and Ottawas were opposed to a treaty and in favor of a war, unless the whites would agree to the Ohio as a boundary line
 We shall see whose influence it was that brought them to this determination
 Immediately after learning of the unto- ward affair, General StSt. Clair ordered the provisions back to Fort Ilarmar and sent messengers with a request that they would forward an accompanying speech to the Nations assembled at the Tawa, or the Detroit River
 He also changed the place for the conference to the Fort
 This change did not, as some writers have held, have any influ- ence on the result
2 for the Council was that upon which the town of Taylorsville was afterwards built

 Through the carelessness of the guard, two of these prisoners escaped, and one of them was afterwards, at the earnest solicitation of Captain Pipe, set free, for the purpose of accompanying that Chief to the Conference of Indian Nations, on the Detroit river

 lie was amhitious, and had grand schemes in view
 lie espoused the cause of the western tribes in their contro- versy with the United States upon the question of bound- ary, and, as early as 1785, attempted to form a confederacy of all the North-western nations and tribes
1 If five of the Six Nations had sold themselves to the devil—otherwise the Yankees—as he declared, he did not intend the fierce Miamis, Shawanese and Kickapoos should do so
 In this benevolent purpose he was encouraged by representatives of the British Government at the western posts
 In March, 1787, Sir John Johnson wrote to Brant, congratu- lating him on the success of the meetings he had been holding in the Indian country near Detroit, which he hoped would have the effect he wished in preventing the Americans from encroaching on the lands west of the river Ohio
 '• Do not suffer an idea to hold place in your mind
" wrote Sir John, " that it will be for your interests to sit still and see the Americans attempt the posts
 It is for your sakes, chiefly, if not entirely, that we hold them
 If you become indifferent about them, they may, perhaps, be given up; what security would youthen have? You would be left at the mercy of a people whose blood calls aloud for revenge; whereas, by supporting them, you encourage us to hold them, and encourage the new settlements, already considerable, and every day increasing by numbers coming in, who find they can't live in the States
''2 Of the same purport was a letter from Lord Dorchester, receiving StSt. Clair's message, turned back, and, meeting with the Sh
iwanese, induced them to remain away from the conference
 It is not clear whether it was the lather or the eon en route to the Mus- kincum
 The adverse influence was traceable to Joseph Brant, the head chief

 through Major Matthews, who expressed a wish to see Col- onel Brant to confer with him for the mutual advantage of that cause which had always been common
 He said that, while his Lordship could not begin a war with the Ameri- cans, " they must see that it was his Lordship's intention to defend the posts; and, while these were preserved, the In- dians must find greater security therefrom, and the Ameri- cans greater difficulty in taking possession of their lands
"1 Brant's activity in the direction indicated, continued throughout 1788, although his correspondence with Gov- ernor StSt. Clair through General Butler, and with General Knox, gave the government ground to hope that that import- ant chief might be brought to support a peace
 The tone of his letters of this period was different from that of his correspondence of former years
 Mr
 Stone expresses the opinion that this change was due to the anticipated suc- cess " which was to crown the Indian diplomacy of Gen- eral StSt. Clair
"2 But it may have been due to craft, or to u wish to pave the way for a change if the United States paid high enough for his services
 I am inclined to attribute it to the former motive
 His correspondence with representatives of tl\e United States was tardy, and every means was resorted to to effect delay until he could have time to form his dreamed-of conspiracy in the North-west, at the head of which he hoped to be placed
 The reply to StSt. Clair's invitation of the 23d De- cember, 1787, to the Five Nations to join in a conference, was not sent to General Butler until July of the following year
 The excuse that Brant offered was, that the "land jobbers," of New York and Massachusetts had been in western New York to purchase some land, and that it had been a tedious business
 He added: "We are preparing to meet your council, and shall be able to write you from the Miamis river what time you may expect to' see us; meantime, we hope you to exercise patience, and not think the time long, as it is a business of importance, which we mean to consider seriously, and hope to settle to mutual 1 Life of Brant, Vol

 155 satisfaction
 I am happy at the idea of meeting you per- sonally, to bring about this long-wished-for business
"1 Meanwhile, General Butler informed General StSt. Clair that Colonel Brant was preparing for a conference of the western Indians at Detroit; and that early in
 July eighty chiefs were already there awaiting the arrival of Brant, whose influence had turned them from the Muskingum to the former place
 It is not known what was done at the council on the Detroit river, but, doubtless, there was a division of sentiment, and a failure in forming a confed- eracy under Brunt
 This chief represents himself, in his correspondence, as acting with the Hurons, Dehuvares, Chippcwas, Ottowas, and Pottawatamies, in favor of form- ing a treaty with the Americans, and having a boundary- line fixed, rather than a war, even at the sacrifice of a small part of their country
 "On the other hand," he said, "the Shawanese, Miamis, and Ivickapoos, who are now so much addicted to horse-stealing that it will be a difficult task to break them of it, as that kind of business is their best har- vest, will, of course, declare for war and not giving up any of their country, which, I am afraid, will bo the means of our separating
" 2 It is apparent that if a war-confederacy could not bo formed between the western tribes and the Six Nations, a general treaty with the Americans was to be prevented, if possible
 The only glimpse we get of this council is fur- nished by the correspondence of Governor StSt. Clair
 He received his information through friendly Indians, who were present, or who served him as messengers
 In one of his letters, he mentions a circumstance that took place be- tween the "Wyandots and the warlike chiefs of the Twig- twees (Miamis), Shawanese, and Kickiipoos
 A chief of • the former placed one end of white wampum on the shoulder of a principal Miami chief, recommending that they be at peace with the Americans, as were the Six Nations
 With- out making any reply, the chief turned aside and let the emblem of peace fall to the ground
 Thereupon, the Wy- 1SL Clair Papers

 audots immediately left the council
 Were the representa- tives of the British nation interested in this? They thought the States could not he consolidated into a Republic, and were encouraged by Shay's Rebellion in Massachusetts, and the Spanish intrigue in Kentucky
 John Connolly, erst- while of Fort Pitt and His Majesty's service, had been sent to Kentucky, by somebody, and was in this very year hold- ing out inducements to the inhabitants of that country to receive the protection of good King George
 As late as December he sent a messenger to the Indians, armed with a, passport, addressed to Captain McKee, in which he asked him to recommend the messenger to the "natives in gen- eral, that no evil consequences may ensue from the inter- ruption of a good design
" This was the situation in 1788, for which Thayendanegea and the British officers were chiefly responsible
 On the 9th of September, the important chiefs began to arrive, but it was not until the middle of December that a sufficient number had appeared to justify General StSt. Clair in attempting a treaty
 The council was opened on on the 15th of December, and on the 29th the cause for the Indiana was stated with great force by the old Wyandot chief, Shandotto, to which Governor StSt. Clair formally re- plied on the 6th of January
 To the demand for the Ohio river as the boundary-line he refused to listen, and ex- plained to the assembled Indians, by a simile, how they had forfeited their country, in becoming allies of the British in the Revolutionary War
2 The business was concluded, and two separate treaties formed on the 9th January; the first with the Six Nations (excepting the Mohawks),confirm- ing the treaty at Fort Stanwix, and the other with the representatives of the Wyandot, Delaware, Chippewa, Ot- tawa, Pottawatomie, and Sac Xations, confirming and bet- tering the treaties of Forts Mclntosh and Finney
 For particulars, I refer the reader to StSt. Clair's letters

 157 and rewarded them liberally, in which, says the author of the Life of Brant, "thero was an approximation to justice toward the Indians which had not been previously count- tenanced by Congress
" l lie did not recognize the Indians as one nation, but as different nations having distinct in- terests, in which he followed their own practice
 "A jealousy subsisted between them," says he, "which I was not willing to lessen by appearing to consider them as one people,"2 and he was of the opinion that their confederacy was broken
 This the author of the Life of Brant calls the Machiavclian policy of dividing to conquer, and then proceeds to denounce it as immoral
 If StSt. Clair had created the divisions which the Indians themselves recog- nized, there would have been some ground for censure; but his action bore a just relation to existing circum- stances
 Mr
 Stone's premises are not sound
 Neither the fiercest of the western tribes nor the Mo- hawks3 were represented at the conference

 2 StSt. Clair Papers
 Letter to the President
 8 Mr
 Stone expresses the opinion that Captain Brant was present, although not a party to the treaty
 He bases this opinion on an am- biguous passage in a letter from Captain Brant to Major Matthews, in March, 1789: "You'll hear by this opportunity the result of our jaunt to the southward, as Captain McKee has sent down all the proceed- ings of our councils with the American Commissioners, speeches and answers
 Our proceedings have been such as 1 hope will be approved of
" But Brant does not refer in this to the Mohawks, but to the Five Nations, who signed the first treaty
' As ho had not yet resigned his headship, ho could with propriety speak of the business in the manner here quoted
 Major Denny, in his journal, under thedatoof November 7th, says•••
 "Brant is expected here in a few days," but in his account of the councils no mention is made of the Mohawk chief, which he would have been apt to do if he had been present More- over, StSt. Clair says in his correspondence with the War Department, that Brant was on his way to the Muskingum with a large party, but upon receiving a message from him turned back, and pursuaded the Shawnese also to do the same
 There is a legend, however, in the StSt. Clair family, that it was a son of Brant who was present, attracted by the charms of Louisa StSt. Clair, and not by any particular interest in the treaty

 the Five Nations was permanently secured
 But there could be no peace while the Shawnesc and Miamis stood out
 The murderous attacks on the pioneers in Kentucky and on the Virginia and Pennsylvania borders were re- newed, and it soon became apparent to General StSt. Clair that severe measures would have to he adopted towards the obstreperous Indians
 Captain Brant does not appear ac- 
tively on the scene again for two years, but he did not omit any opportunity to denounce the treaties of Fort Harmar, even while he was receiving tokens of the high regard of the United States government
1 StSt. Clair visited his family, and afterwards proceeded to Xew York to concert measures with General Knox for the settlement of the Indian difficulties
 While there, he had the pleasure of assisting at the inauguration2 of his old Commander-in-Chicf, and devoted friend, as first President of the United States
 We are indebted to Colonel May, who had also left the banks of the Muskingum, for a graphic description of the ceremonies of that ever-memor- able day
 There were ringing of church bells, prayers for blessings upon the head of him who had come to be the head of the nation, parading of the military, an imposing administering of the oath in the Senate Chamber, followed 1General Washington, in a letter to Governor Clinton: "It gives me pleasure to learn from you the friendly sentiments of Captain Brant; and with you I think thoy merit cultivation; but he has not been candid in his account of tho conduct of General StSt. Clair, nor done justice in his representation of matters at Muskingum
 It is notorious that he used all the art and influence of which ho was pos- sessed to prevent any treaty being held; and that, except in a small degree, General StSt. Clair aimed at no more land by the treaty of Mus- kingum than had been ceded by the previous treaties

 159 in the evening, by illuminations and lire-works, very bril- liant, which the people applauded, as they did every thing on that joyous occasion
 The President was very dignified, but Colonel May thought him much altered in countenance since he last saw him
 After this, StSt. Clair remained in New York, waiting patiently for legislative action to enable him to proceed with the new government, and for the formulation of an Indian policy
 There was a personal matter, too, in which he was deeply interested, concerning which it was his duty to take counsel of his friends
 It was no less than that of resigning the Territorial Governorship, and returning to Pennsylvania to enter actively into political life
 After the requisite number of States had adopted the Constitution, the name of StSt. Clair was freely canvassed in connection with the position of Vice-President
 In July, 1789, while he was waiting on the new government, he received an urgent letter from his old friend James Wilson, asking an immediate interview for the purpose of deciding whether he would stand for the governorship of Pennsylvania
 It was not StSt. Clair's manner to look back when once his hands were upon the plow, but he found himself in a false position in the "West
 He had no genius for speculation; his salary as Governor would barely cover his traveling ex- penses; his family was large, and his wife, who had been accustomed to every comfort, was not well fitted for a pioneer life
 The mistake he made in leaving Pennsylvania might be rectified by an early- return
 But a canvass showed that the party led by General Mifflin, who knew how to catch the popular breeze, was in the majority
 The de- moralization and discontent following the Revolution favored the plans of those who had not been closely identi- fied with the party of Washington during the war
 It was late in the year before General StSt. Clair received his final instructions and turned his face toward the West again, to resume the work of constructing a government in a wilderness filled with hostile savages, distant from the supporting power, with an imperfect and unreliable system of communication, and without adequate means

 ately after the treaty of Fort Ilarniar, the Indians were more quiet than usual, only a few depredations having been committed and those hy the Miamis
1 But later this quiet gave place to a predatory warfare on the borders of Penn- sylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky, in which all of the dis- satisfied tribes engaged
 The Indians took possession of a high point of land on the Ohio near the mouth of the Sci- oto, whence they sent out parties to waylay the boats pass- ing up and down the river
 Thrilling events occurred, which will be found duly recorded in Indian history, to which the curious reader, who would sup on horrors is re- ferred
2 Something of these will be found related in the StSt. Clair papers printed in this work
 It is the purpose of this memoir to touch on only the most salient points, and the above reference to the general situation, will suffice for our purpose
 The citizens of Marietta gave special attention to the preparation of a residence for Governor StSt. Clair, and in the winter of 1790, his son Arthur, twenty-one years of age, and three daughters, Louisa, Jane, and Margaret, with a middle-aged, sensible, colored woman who acted as cook and housekeeper, took possession
 Mrs
 StSt. Clair still remained in the East
3 Louisa, the eldest of the three daughters, was about nineteen years of age, and is described by Pro- fessor Ilildrcth as " a healthy, vigorous girl, full of life and activity, every way calculated for a soldier's daughter; fond of a frolic, and ready to draw amusement from

 President Washington attributed the mischief to the Shawanese
 A quarrel arose this year between the Miamis and Delawares, which caused the latter to withdraw beyond the Mississippi river—an event greatly deplored by the British agents as it threatened the destruction of the Confederacy
 2Judge Innes, of Kentucky, estimated, in 1790, that within seven years over fifteen hundred whites had teen killed, and twenty thous- and horses and other property stolen by the Indians
 The statement frequently made at this time that the savages were always the aggres- sors, was not correct
 There were bad whites as well as bad red men

 161 every thing around her
 She was a fine equestrienne, and would mount the most wild and spirited horse without fear, managing him with case and gracefulness; dashing through the open woodlands around Campus Martins at full gallop, leaping over logs or any obstruction that fell in her way
 She was one of the most rapid skaters in the garrison; few, if any, of the young men equaling her in speed and activ- ity, or in graceful movements in this enchanting exercise
 Her elegant person and neat dress showing to much advan- tage, called forth loud plaudits from both young and old
 The broad sheet of ice on the Muskingum, near the garri- son, for a few days in the winter, afforded a fine field for this healthy sport
 She was also an expert huntress; and would have afforded a good figure of Diana in her rambles through the woods, had she been armed with the bow in- stead of the rifle
 Of this instrument she was a perfect mistress; loading and firing with the accuracy of a back- woodsman, killing a squirrel from the highest tree, or cut- ting off the head of a partridge with wonderful precision
 She was fond of roaming in the woods, and often went out alone into the forest near Marietta, fearless of the savages that occasionally lurked in the vicinity
 She was as active on foot as on horseback, and could walk for several miles with the rapidity of a ranger
 Her manners were refined; her person beautiful with highly cultivated intellectual powers, having been educated with much care in Philadel- phia
 Born with a healthy, vigorous frame, she had strengthened both her body and mind by these athletic ex- ercises when a child; probably first encouraged by her father, who had spent the larger portion of his life in camps
 She was one of those rare spirits, so admirably fitted to the times and the manners of the day in which she lived
" There is a legend in which she appears as a heroine, figur- ing at the treaty of Foit Ilarmar and again in the disas- trous Indian campaign later, which will be found duly chronicled further on
 On the 2d of January, 1790, Governor StSt. Clair arrived 11

 at Fort Washington, " in the purchase of Judge Symmes,''1 and on the 4th, he issued a proclamation establishing the county of Hamilton, which comprised all of the district lying between the Little Miami on the east, and the Big Miami on the west, and the Ohio on the south, to a line on the north drawn from the standing Stone Forks, on the Big Miami, due east to the Little Miami
 Courts were estab- lished, and officers appointed in the same manner as in the case of Washington county
 William Goforrh, William Wells and William McMillan were appointed Judges of the Court of Common Pleas and Justices of the Court of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace
 Israel Ludlow was made Clerk of the several Courts
2 Cincinnati was declared to be the county seat
 It is related that Governor StSt. Clair gave to the "city," which had been laid out,the name "Cincinnati" in lieu of a barbarous compound—Losantiville—invented by Mat- thias Denman, of Springfield, New Jersey, Colonel Patter- son, of Lexington, and John Filson, a surveyor who had formed a partnership and planned a settlement opposite the mouth of the Licking river, on land which Denman had purchased of Judge Symmes

 Filson having been killed by the Indians," his place was supplied by Israel Ludlow, another surveyor, who platted and laid out the city of Cin- 1 The purchase mad

 Jndge Sy mmes sold ten thousand acres to Major Benjamin Stites and others on the Ohio, south of the mouth of the Little Miami
 Major Stites arrived on tho purchase in November, 178S, and laid out Columbia, which for some time had more inhabitants than any other point below Marietta
 In December of the same year, the party organized by Matthias Don- man located on the Ohio, opposite the mouth of the Licking, the site of Cincinnati
 Jndge Symmes himself (whose arrival at Marietta was noted by Mnjor Denny), located at North Bend in February, 17S9
 At his request, General Harmar sent detachments of troops to protect the settlements at Columbia and North Bend, atid subsequently Fort Wash- ington was erected, opposite the mouth of the Licking, by that officer

 Judge Burnet, who became a citizen of the Ohio country somewhat later, says in his Notes on the North- west, that the whimsical name of Losantiville was repu- diated after the accession of Ludlow to the partnership, and it is inferred that the name of Cincinnati was then adopted
 There are, however, important witnesses to the fact that the name was given to the place by Governor StSt. Clair
 Benjamin Van Cleve, a name well-known in pioneer history, arrived at Fort Washington on the 3d of January, the day after StSt. Clair, and in memoranda kept by him he says "the Governor altered the name from Lo- santiville to Cincinnati
"1 And this statement is undoubt- edly authentic
 John Cleves Symmes, writing from North Bend, under date of 9th January, 1790, says: "The Gov- ernor has made Losantiville the county town, by the name of Cincinnati, so that Losantiville will become extinct
" The Governor, the Secretary, and the Judges were old revolutionary soldiers, and most of them were mem- bers of the Society of the Cincinnati
 Washington, Ham- ilton and StSt. Clair were original and conspicuous mem- bers, and personal friends
 We have seen that the name of the old Commander-in-Chief was given to the first, and that of his distinguished Aid to the second county es- tablished by the other of the trio
 What more natural than that the military, social, and benevolent Society which was formed after the war in which they were conspicuous figures, for the purpose of perpetuating the memory of 1 Memoranda of Benjamin Van Cleve: "We landed at Losantiville, opposite the mouth of Licking river, on the 3d day of January, I71

164 Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair, that struggle for freedom, and affording aid to the sur- vivors, should also be remembered by StSt. Clair at this time? In a short time the name of StSt. Clair was given to the third county and that of General Knox, who was concerned in the drafting of the charter of the Society, to the fourth, by Secretary Sargent, who, despite the modest protests of the Governor, took good care to see that his own chief was not neglected in the records
 The Governor remained at Fort Washington only a week,1 and then hastened on toward the Mississippi, where his coming was looked for with great impatience
 The inhab- itants of the French towns on that river had been persist- ent in their appeals to the old Continental Congress to give them a government, and the President was very anxious that General StSt. Clair should establish the forms of civil government there as soon as practicable
2 The Governor reached the Rapids of the Ohio on the 8th, where he remained long enough to prepare dispatches containing speeches ad- dressed to the Indian tribes on the Wabash, which he trans- mitted to Major Hamtramck, commandant at Post Vin- cennes, with instructions to send them to their destination by Antoine Gamelin, a trader, who was very popular among the Indians
 It was StSt. Clair's plan to first organize the Illinois country and then return to Post Vincennes, by which time he hoped favorable replies would be received from the Wabash Indians
3 But as it turned out otherwise he was, upon his return, compelled to leave the work of or- ganization at Vincennes to Secretary Sargent, and hasten to the east to provide means for the chastisement of the savages and the relief of the suffering inhabitants of the various posts
 Governor StSt. Clair arrived at Kaskaskia in February
 He found the inhabitants in an impoverished condition, and rendered incapable of taking any action looking to permanent improvements, on account of the uncertainty of 1 Records of Governor North-western Territory—State Department

 165 the tenure of the lands they occupied
 He described the condition of the people in a report to the Secretary of State: "The Illinois country, as well as that upon the Wabash, has been involved in great distress ever since it fell under the American dominion
" He said the inhabitants had contributed supplies liberally to the support of the troops under General Clark, for which they received certificates which had been repudiated by the State of Virginia, by whose authority the expedition led by Clark had been un- dertaken; that, after the Illinois regiment had been dis- banded, " a set of men, pretending the authority of Vir- ginia, embodied themselves, and a scene of general depre- dation and plunder ensued
 To this succeeded three suc- cessive and extraordinary inundations from the Mississippi, which either swept away their crops, or prevented their being planted
 The loss of the greatest part of their trade with the Indians, which was a great resource, came upon them at this juncture, as well ns the hostile incursions of some of the tribes, which had ever before been in friend- ship with them; and to these was added the loss of their whole last crop of corn by an untimely frost
 Extreme misery could not fail to be the consequence of such accumu- lated misfortunes

 StSt. Clair's aid was invoked, in pathetic terms, by Father Gibault, the venerable priest of Kiiskaskia and Cahokia: "Your Excellency is an eye- witness," said he, "of the poverty to which the inhabitants are reduced, aiid of the total want of provisions to subsist on
 Not knowing where to find a morsel of bread to nourish their families, by what means can they support the expense of a survey which has not been sought for on their parts, and for which, it is conceived by them, there is no necessity?

"1 StSt. Clair did every thing in his power, and went-beyond the technical restrictions formed by an authority a thou- sand miles awny to relieve the distress surrounding him
 His familiarity with the French language proved a great help to him in his work
 The county of StSt. Clair was erected, courts established
, and officers appointed, the same as in other cases
 The county embraced the section of country extending from the River Ohio northward to the mouth of Little Mackinaw Creek, where it empties into the Illinois River

 Receiving from Major Hamtramck the information that Antoine Gamelin had failed to persuade the Wabash In- dians to enter into a treaty with the Americans, Governor StSt. Clair hastened to complete the work of organization, and on the llth of June began his return journey
 Before his departure, he wrote to Major Ham tram ck, advising him of his purpose to prepare for a military movement against the Indians on the Wabash, and that Colonel Sargent would proceed to Post Vincennes, to make the civil ap- appointmente, organize the militia, and carry out the plan for the adjustment of land claims agreeably to the proclama- tion he had issued to the inhabitants of that section from Kaskaskia

 b:ick across the Ohio
 A Kickapoq chief said: "You in- vite us to stop our young men
 It is impossible to do it, being constantly encouraged by the British
" General StSt. Clair, after conferring with General Ilarmar, determined to send an expedition against the Maumee towns, under the command of that officer
 A circular let- ter was issued to the County Lieutenants of Kentucky and "Western Pennsylvania, informing them that there was no prospect of a peace with the tribes on the Wabash, and in- structing them to call out the militia allotted to their respective counties, to rendezvous at Fort Washington by the 15th of September
 "When the militia did arrive, Gen- eral Ilarmar was much disheartened, as they "were Taw and unused to the gun or woods
" "One half," says Major Denny, in his excellent journal, "serve no other purpose than to swell their number
 If the leading patriots of Ken- tucky don't turn out rascals, then some men that I know are greatly mistaken
" l Those from Pennsylvania were but little better
 In addition, a large portion of the arms were unfit for use—many of the muskets and rifles being without locks! The militia officers quarreled, and the men were insubordinate
 Colonel Trotter aspired to the com- mand, although Colonel Hardin was the senior officer
 Some of the men declared they would return home unless Colonel Trotter could lead them, and a compromise be- came necessary
 "When on the march, October 2d, the force was found to consist of three hundred and twenty regulars under the immediate command of Majors Wyllys and Doughty, and one thousand one hundred and thirty-three militia under the command of Colonel Ilardin, an old Continental officer
 The route was by old Chillicothe, at the headwaters of the Little Miami, thence to Mad River, and thence to the Miami or Omec River, which they struck near the ruins of La Source's trading post
 Here they captured a Shawanesc Indian, who informed them that the Indians were leaving their village (distant about thirty miles) as fast as possible

 169 Colonel Hardin was detached with six hundred light troops and one company of regulars
 lie was instructed to push for the Miami village, which was at the junction of the St
 Joseph and St
 Mary rivers, and take every precaution to keep his men under strict discipline
 When he reached the village on the 15th, he found it deserted
 On the 17th, he was joined by the main body, aud the order was given for the destruction of the buildings and the vast fields of corn stretching along the bottoms of the streams
 The militia, regardless of discipline, broke into squads and strolled about in search of plunder, but fortunately were not disturbed
 The following dnv, Colonel Trotter was ordered out with *' three hundred militia aud thirty regulars, under Captain Armstrong, with instructions to see if he could find traces of the Indians
 lie returned at night without having ac- complished any thing
 The next day Colonel Hardin went out with the same command
 Before he had proceeded very far the militia began to desert, but this did not make him more cautious
 When distant from camp ten miles, he suddenly came upon about one hundred Indians, "and, owing to the bad order of his men, and their dastardly con- duct, was entirely defeated
" At the first fire of the Indians nearly all of the militia fled without firing a shot
 As usual, the regulars stood firm, and were cut to pieces
 "I lost one sergeant and twenty-one out of thirty men of ray command," says the brave Captain Armstrong in his report, and was obliged to retreat
 We should think it was about time
 All effort of Colonel Hardin to raily the militia was unavailing
 About seventy men were killed
 On the 21st, the army, having burned the Indian capital and five villages and destroyed twenty thousand bushels of corn in ears—the object of the expedition—took up their line of march back to Fort Washington, and encamped eight miles from the ruins
 At nine o'clock, at the solici- tation of Colonel Hardin, General Harmar ordered out four hundred men, including sixty regulars, under Major Wyllys, with instructions to return to the Indian town, on the head- waters of the Miami, to surprise any parties that might

 have returned there
 The troops crossed the Miami early in the morning, and it was the intention to surround the village before making an attack
 But the militia, led by Majors Hall and McMillan, came upon a few Indians im- mediately after crossing the river, put them to flight, and, contrary to orders, pursued up the St
 Joseph for several miles
 The center, composed of the regular troops, was soon afterwards attacked by the main body of the Indians, under Little Turtle, and, although they fought with des- peration, were obliged at length to give way
 The few sur- vivors fled in the direction taken by the militia, and met them returning from the pursuit of the scattering Indians
 They were followed by the Indians, who attempted to pass the stream, but were repulsed
 The savages did not per- sist in their attack, and the troops, after collecting the wounded, returned to camp
 The loss of the regular sol- diers was forty-eight men and two officers—Major Wyllys and Lieutenant Frothingham—of the militia, not so many
 But the death of the brave Wyllys was a loss long felt and mourned over
 Although this expedition was in most respects a complete success, it was, owing to the bad conduct of the militia, attended with a severe loss of regular troops, which called forth censorious comments on General Harmar
 That meritorious officer, after be had been vindicated by a court- martial, could not be prevailed on to continue in the ser- vice, and in the following year resigned his commission
 "^our friend, General StSt. Clair," said Washington, in a letter to La Fayettc, "resumes his functions as Major- General
" 1 It was even so
 The result of StSt. Clair's visit to Philadelphia and his report on affairs in the terri- tory, was: First, to send a formidable military force into the Miami country, and erect a series of forts, as recom- mended by him the preceding year; and, secondly, to send minor expeditions against the Wabash tribes to pun- ish them for their reckless marauding and refusal of the offer of peace in the spring of 1790
 A new regiment was 1Letter of the 1'Jth March, 1791

 171 to be added to the military establishment, and General St
 Cluir was to conduct the expedition against the Miami towns in person, with General Richard Butler second in command
 The equipment was to be complete in all re- spects, and the most cordial co-operation was promised on the part of the War Department
 While this promise was being indifferently regarded, two expeditions were sent against the Wabash towns
 The first, under c/ unmand of Brigadier-General Scott and Colonel James Wilkinson, left the Ohio at the month ot the Kentucky river on the 23d of May, and marched directly for the Wea village Ouiatenon, on the Wabash
1 This and other im- portant towns were destroyed, and a few Indians killed and captured
 The second expedition was authorized by Gov- ernor StSt. Clair, on the 25th of June
 It consisted of five hundred mounted men, under the command of Brigadier- general Wilkinson, and marched from near Fort Washing- ton, on the 20th of July, for the Indian village Ke-na-pa- com-a-qua (1'Anguille), situated on the Eel river, about six miles above its confluence with the Wabash
 This and various other villages, and several hundred acres of corn were destroyed, and a considerable number of prisoners capture 1
 This expedition was conducted with such celer- ity and signal success, as to receive a special letter of thanks from the Secretary of War, which was communicated to Wilkinson through Governor StSt. Clair
 But how was it with the main expedition? This entry is found in Major Denny's Journal, under the date of Sep- tember 1st: "General StSt. Clair appears exceeding impa- tient at the delay or detention of some of the corps
 The Quartermaster-General, Hodgdon, not yet come on, and General Butler, the second in command, is also back
 Preparations for the campaign very backward

 Whose was the fault? The story may be told in a few words
 The War De- partment had undertaken to provide an army, equip and 1 About eight miles below the present city of La Fayette

 provision it, and have the same at Fort Washington by the 10th of July
 "In this case," wrote General Knox, " you will have assembled a force of three thousand effectives, at least, besides leaving small garrisons on the Ohio, in order to perform your main expedition
1" In April, the Federal part of the force was still to be recruited
 There was a de- mand for labor every-where, and such rhen as were finally induced to enlist were not the kind of material out of which the best soldiers are made
 Kor was this the only difficulty; no money had yet been furnished General But- ler to pay the men and provide stores for them
 The mil- itia were no better; some of them even worse
 All were unaccountably delayed on the upper Ohio until the sum- mer had been far spent
2 The levies that now straggled into Fort Washington gave such evidence of a love of strong drink as to necessitate their removal to Camp Lud- low, beyond the reach of temptation
 There was neither quartermaster nor commissary; the commanding general was both
3 He was also chief artisan, and superintended the construction and repair of every thing, from gun-car- riages to cartridge-boxes—the thousand details incident to the creation and preparation of an armed force, without the means which may be commanded in an old country
 Here the ingenuity and restless energy of the commanding general supplied what it had been the duty of quarter- master and other subordinates to furnish
 But though genius were never more fruitful and energy more tireless, yet even StSt. Clair found it impossible to improve the qual- ity of the powder;4 to make an elephantine pack-saddle fit the back of an Indian pony; to transform raw lines into veteran soldiers in a week; make honest men out of rogues; nor by command, similar to that of Joshua of old, stop the sun in its course and delay the revolutions of the seasons

 173 Quartermaster-General Hodgden1 arrived at Tort Washing- ton und StSt. Clair hud already moved forward his two thou- sand men—not three thousand effectives, as promised by the Secretary of War—about twenty-four miles
2 If he had gone forward and constructed Forts Hamilton and Jef- ferson and then disbanded the militia and gone into winter quarters, all might have been well
 But StSt. Clair was a strict soldier, and kept rigidly to orders
 He saw ever be- fore him these passages in correspondence from the War Department: "The President still continues anxious that you should, at the earliest moment, commence your opera- tions
" "lie therefore enjoins you, by every principle that is sacred, to stimulate your operations in the highest degree, and to move as rapidly as the lateness of the season and the nature of the case will possibly admit
" Accordingly, he pushed on
 Forts Hamilton and Jefferson were con- structed under the greatest difficulties, as there were few tools,3 and the rainy season had set in
 It was on the 24th of October that the little army left Fort Jefferson and moved through the wilderness toward the Maumee, where another fort was to be erected
 The frost had cut off the forage, the men were on half rations, and the militia deserted in such numbers that the general found it necessary to dispatch Major Hamtramck with the First regiment, three hundred strong, to arrest them and bring up the provisions that were supposed to be en route
 The commanding general, who was now prostrated with severe sickness, had left only about fourteen hundred men
 Every precaution was taken on the march and in camp to guard against a surprise
 On the 3d of November, the troops encamped on high 1 StSt. Clair was sorely tempted to arrest and try the qunrtermaster- general for disobedience of orders and neglect of duty, but upon re- flection decided that in case of disaster it would be attributed to his act

 ground on a small creek supposed to be a branch of the Maumee, but which was, in fact, a branch of the W
ibsish
 The high ground was barely sufficient for the regulars in rather contracted lines, but it was the best that could be found
1 The militia, under Colonel Oldham, passed beyond the creek ti quarter of a mile, and encamped in parallel lines the same as the regulars
 Before mid-night, General Butler dispatched Captain Slough, with thirty-two men, to reconnoiter in front of the lines
 That officer was told by Colonel Oldham that, in his opinion, the troops would be attacked in the morning
 He saw enough Indians in the woods to confirm that opinion
 He immediately re- turned to camp and communicated to General Butler what ho had learned, and added that if thought proper he would go and make the report to General StSt. Clair
 General But- ler remained silent for some time, and then, thanking Cap- tain Slough for his attention and vigilance, remarked that, as he must be fatigued, he had better go and lie down
'2 Captain Slough obeyed
 General Butler neither communi- cated to General StSt. Clair the information he had received, nor took any further precautions against the enemy
 On the morning of the 4th, a half hour before sunrise, and when the men had just -been dismissed from parade, an attack was made on the militia
 Simultaneously with the crack of the rifle, was heard the yells of the savages
 The militia fled pell-mell through the first line of regulars, who were attempting to form, and caused some confusion
 However, the enemy was well received by the front line, but almost instantly the entire camp seemed to be sur- rounded by an unseen foe
 The men were pressed toward the center, where were huddled the craven militia, and foil bv scores under the unerring aim of the savages, who fired from the wooil}r covert surrounding them
 Every-where could be seen StSt. Clair, who had left his sick quarters upon the first fire, endeavoring to reform the lines
 He repeat- edly directed the men to charge against the skulking foe, 1 Major Denni/s Journal

 175 who fled before the bayonet, and then returned to the attack
 The officers attracted the aim of the savages, and they fell on every hand
 Among those wounded early was General Butler, hut he continued to urge resistance
 When, at last, all of the artillery officers had been either killed or wounded, and the fire of the Indians became so near and deadly from all points as to threaten the annihilation of the force, preparation was made for a retreat
 Such of the wounded as could he moved were gathered together and a charge was made against the enemy, under cover of which the retreat was accomplished
 "A few officers," says Major Denny, "put themselves in front
 The men followed
 The enemy gave way, and, perhaps, not being aware of the design, we were, for a few minutes, left undisturbed
 The stoutest and most active now took the lead, and those who were foremost in breaking the enemy's lines were soon loft behind
 At the moment of the retreat, one of the few horses saved had been procured for the General; he was on foot until then; I kept by him, and he delayed to see the rear
" The General commanded his Aid, Major Denny, to push to the front and rally a force sufficient to check the panic, and then turned his attention to the care of those who were partially disabled by wounds
 As he and the officer in command of the rear-guard moved over the route, evidence was sei'n on every bund that the retreat had been a disgraceful flight, even to the very gates of Fort Jefferson,1 where, at last, under the assuring presence of Major Hamtramck's regulars, terror gave place to con- fidence
 What pen can fittingly describe the scenes of that day ?— the unexpected attack, the panic, the brave resistance of a devoted few, under the inspiring example of noble officers, the charge aftor charge through the forest, the destruction of the lines, the gradual encircling of the camp by the unseen foe, the terror of the poor wretches huddled in the center, who had fled without a shot, the groans and shrieks 1 StSt. Clairs Official Report, Nov

 of the wounded under the scalping knife after the retreat, and the flight through the wilderness? A word more and we shall ring down the curtain on this scene
 The killed and missing numbered thirty-seven offi- cers and five hundred and ninety-three privates; the woun- ded, thirty-one officers and two hundred and fifty-two pri- vates
 Among the former were -Major-General Butler, Major Ferguson, of the artillery, Major Hart and Major Clark, of the fir=it regiment, and Lieutenant-Colonel Old- ham, of the militia
 Among the latter were Colonel Sar- gent, who acted as Adjutant-General, Lieutenant-Colonel Gibson, Major Butler, and Viscount Malartie, a volunteer aid
 The escape of StSt. Clair was miraculous
1 Not an offi- 1 The following description of St
 Glair's conduct during the action, taken from the Narrative of the Campaign, will best show the coolness and courage of the man: "During the engagement, General StSt. Clair and General Butler were continually going up and down the line; as one went up one, the other went down the opposite
 StSt. Clair was so severely afflicted with gout as to he unable to mount or dismount a horse without assistance
 He had four horses for his use; they had been turned out to feed over night, and were brought in before the action
 "The first he attempted to mount was a young horse, and the firing alarmed him so much that he was unable to accomplish it, although there were three or four people assisting him
 He had just moved him to a place where he could have some advantage of the ground, when the horse was shot through the head, and the boy that was holding him through the arm
 A second horse was brought, and the furniture of the first disengaged and put on him; but at the moment it was done, the horse and servant who held him were killed
 The General then ordered the third horse to be got ready, and follow him to the left of the front line, which by that time was warmly engaged, and set off on foot to the point designated
 However, the horse and man were never heard of afterward and were supposed to have both been killed
 Gen- eral St
 Glair's fourth horse was killed under the Count de Malartie, one of his aids, whose horse had died while on the march
 "On the day of the battle, General StSt. Clair was not in his uniform; he wore a coarse cappo coat, and a three-cornered hat
 He had a long cue, and large locks, very gray, flowing beneath his beaver
 Early in the action, when near the artillery, a ball grazed the side of his face, and cut off a portion of one of his locks
 During the action, eight balls passed through his clothes and hat
 After his horses were killed,

 177 cer exposed himself as much as he, and yet it was always with a calm courage seeking to reach the enemy effectively
 "I have nothing to lay to the charge of the troops," said he, in his official report, "but their want of discipline, which, from the short time they had been in service, it was impos- sible they should have acquired, and which rendered it very difficult when they were thrown into confusion to reduce them again to order, and is one reason why the loss has fallen so heavy on the officers, who did every thing in their power to effect it
" It was a wonder to General Harmar, at the time, and is no less a wonder to us to day, that the commanding general, who was known to be competent, whose courage had been often proved, who knew the supe- riority of the Indians, trained from infancy to war on such a field, should think of hazarding with such people and un- der such circumstances, his reputation and life, and the lives of others
 StSt. Clair hoped to have an inquiry made by military officers, but that being impracticable the matter came be- fore Congress, and was there very thoroughly examined
 he exerted himself on foot for a considerable time during the action, with a degree of alertness that surprised every body who saw him
 "After being on foot for some time, and when nearly exhausted, a pack-horse was brought to him
 This he rode during the remainder of the day, although he could scarcely prick him out of a walk
 Had he not been furnished with a horse, although unhurt, he must have re- mained on the field
 "During the entire action, General StSt. Clair exerted himself with a courage and presence of mind worthy of the best fortune
 He was personally present at the first charge made upon the enemy with the bayonet, and gave the order to Colonel Darke
 When the enemy first entered the camp by the left flank, he led the troops which drove them back, and when a retreat became indispensable, he put himself at the head of the troops which broke through the enemy, and opened the way for the rest, and then remained in the rear, making every exertion in his power to obtain a party to cover the retreat; but the panic was so great, that his exertions were of little avail
 In the height of the action, a few of the men crowded around the fires in the center of the camp
 StSt. Clair was seen drawing his pistols and, threatening some of them, and ordering them to turn out and repel the enemy

 The opinion of the committee must stand as the judgment of the historian :— "The committee conceive it but justice to the com- mander-in-chief, to say, that in their opinion, the failure of the late expedition can in no respect be imputed to his conduct, either at any time before or during the action; but that, as his conduct in all the preparatory arrangements, was marked with peculiar ability and zeal, so his conduct during the action, furnished strong testimonies of his cool- ness and intrepidity
" The Indians outnumbered the whites, and they fought as they never fought before
 The fact must be kept in view that they had been rendered desperate by the desola- tion of their homes, and that they were fighting against a people who were trying to deprive them of their lands
 After the expedition of General Harmar, the Indians re- ceived from the British posts large supplies of provisions and ammunition which rendered abortive the destructive expeditions of the Americans
 The British influence was further exerted in the direction of forming an Indian con- federacy among the Western tribes
 In this last engagement many young Canadians and half-breeds and one hundred and fifty Mohawk warriors participated
 The whole was commanded by the distinguished Miami chief, Little Turtle
 It is now believed that Little Turtle had the council and assistance of another and an older chief
 "General StSt. Clair," says the author of the life of Brant, " probably died in ignorance of the fact that one of the master spirits against whom he contended, and by whom he was so sig- nally defeated, was none other than Joseph Brant—Thay- endanegea
 How it happened that this distinguished chief, from whom so much had been expected as a peace maker, thus suddenly and efficiently threw himself into a position of active hostility, unless he thought he saw an opening for reviving his project of a great North-western confed- eracy, is a mystery which he is believed to have carried in his own bosom to the grave
1" 1This interesting fact, Mr
 Stone says, he derived from Thayendane- gea's family
 It was, however, the opinion of StSt. Clair that Joseph

 179 After his return to Fort Washington, on the 9th of No- vember, StSt. Clair wrote his official dispatch to the Secretary Brant was engaged in this contest, as a number of his followers were present at the battle
 There is a legend that the Brant who was en- gaged in that affair was a son of Joseph Brant
 The story is known as "The Legend of Louisa StSt. Clair," and is as follows: The proposed Indian treaty at Duncan's Falls, in 1788, being post- poned and adjourned to Fort Harmar, the Indians prepared for peace or war, and were hostile to holding a convention to adjust peace meas- ures under the guns of Harmar and Campus Martins
 Young Brant, son of the famous Chief of that name, came down the Tuscarawas and Muskingum trail with two hundred warriors, camped at Duncan Falls, nine miles below Zanesville, and informed Governor StSt. Clair, by run- ner, that they desired the treaty preliminaries to be fixed there
 The Governor suspected a plot to get him to the Falls and abduct him, yet nothing had transpired of that import
 He sent Brant's run- ner back with word that he would soon answer by a ranger
 Hamilton Kerr was dispatched to Duncan's Falls to reconnoiter and deliver StSt. Clair's letter
 A short distance above Waterford Kerr saw tracks, and keeping the river in sight crept on a bluff, and raised to his feet, when hearing the laugh of a woman, he came down to the trail, and saw Louisa StSt. Clair on a pony, dressed Indian style, with a short rifle slung to her body
 Stupefied with amazement, the ranger lost his speech, well knowing Louisa, who was the bravest and boldest girl of all at the fort
 She had left without knowledge of any one, and calling "Ham"—as he was known by that name—to his senses, told him she was going to Duncan's Falls to see Brant
 Expostulation on his part only made her laugh the londer, and she twitted him on his comical dress—head tur- baned with red handkerchief, hunting shirt, but no trowsers, the breech- clout taking their place
 Taking her pony by the head, he led it up to the trail, and at night they suppered on dried deer meat from Ham's pouch
 The pony was tied, and Louisa sat against a tree and slept, rifle in hand, while Ham watched her
 Next morning they pursued their way, and finally came in sight of the Indian camp
 She then took her father's letter from the ranger, and telling him to hide and await her return, dashed off on her pony, and was soon a prisoner
 She asked for Brant, who appeared in war panoply, but was abashed at her gaze
 She handed him the letter, remarking that they had met be- fore, he as a stndent on a visit from college to Philadelphia, and she as the daughter of General StSt. Clair, at school
 He bowed; being ed- ucated, read the letter, and became excited
 Louisa, perceiving this, said she had risked her life to see him, and asked for a guard back to Marietta
 Brant told her he guarded the brave, and would accompany her home
 In the evening of the third day, they arrived with Ham

 of "War, which contains a comprehensive account of the disastrous campaign, and charged his aid, Major Denny, with its prompt delivery
 This report is a model in its way, cool, dispassionate, magnanimous in a high degree
 The nobleness of spirit so characteristic of StSt. Clair is con- spicuous in every line
 There is no fault finding, no allu- sion to the shameful mismanagement in the War Depart- ment (that he knew would be made apparent in the in- vestigation he was determined to have), and no allusion to the neglect of Colonel Oldhum and General Butler to ad- vise him of the presence of the enemy on the night of the 3d of November: had not their lives been sacrificed on that fatal day? Major Denny discharged his commission with his usual promptness and good judgment
 Upon his ar- rival in Philadelphia, which was at a late hour on the 19th of December, he waited immediately upon the Secretary of War, and delivered his dispatches
 "The morning after my arrival here," he says, "General Knox called al my quarters and took me to the President's, where we breakfasted with the family, and afterwards had much talk on the subject of the campaign and defeat
" In striking contrast with this simple statement, is that highly imaginary account attributed to Mr
 Custis, which is found copied into the works of several historians; among others, Irving gives it the weight of his approval
 In that work of the imagination we have the picture of an officer in full uniform, dismounting in front of the President's house, towards the close of a winter's day in December
 Kerr at the fort, where she introduced Brant to her father, relating the incident
 After some hours, he was escorted out of the lines, re- turned to the Falls, and went up the valley with his warriors, without a treaty, but in love with Louisa StSt. Clair
 In January, 1789, he returned, took no part in the Fort Harmar treaty, was at the feast, and asked StSt. Clair in vain for his daughter's hand
 In the fall of 1791, Brant led the Chippewas for a time during the battle at StSt. Clair's defeat, and told the warriors to shoot the general's horse, but not him
 StSt. Clair had four horses killed, and as many bul- let holes in his clothes, but escaped unhurt
 Had StSt. Clair given his daughter to young Brant, would the alliance have averted war?

 181 The porter would have refused him admittance, as the President was at dinner, and had company, but the offi- cer was on pressing public business, and would not be denied
 A servant went after the Secretary, Mr
 Lear, but to that functionary the officer refused to deliver his letters
 Thereupon, Mr
 Lear returned to the dinning-room, and in a whisper communicated to the President what had passed
 Washington withdrew into the hall, and in a short time returned and resumed his seat at the table
 That evening Mrs
 Washington had a reception
 The President appeared there with his usual serenity
 Neither then nor at the table did he allude to any thing unusual
 After the com- pany had gone and only his secretary remained, Washing- ton suddenly became extremely agitated, and poured forth a torrent of bitter invective against StSt. Clair
 This was followed by some moments of calm reflection, during which the President apparently regretted the exhibition of pas- sion
 "This must not go beyond this room," said he, in a subdued and altered tone; "General StSt. Clair shall have justice
 I looked hastily through the dispatches; saw the whole disaster, but nut all the particulars
 I will receive him without displeasure; I will hear him without preju- dice; he shall have full justice
"1 Here we have the man Washington giving way to his passions in the most unreasonable manner, contrasted with the philosopher Washington, cool, just and magnanimous
 This work of the rhetorician is calculated to make the pages of a book attractive, but it does not give one as natural and exalted a view of the President as the plain account of Major Denny
 Among the StSt. Clair papers is a pleasant note from Mr
 Lear, changing the hour for a conference which had been agreed on, to the hour of breakfast the following day, when the President would be pleased to receive his old friend
 The meeting was altogether cordial, and, with this scene in our mind, we read, with exalted sentiments of esteem for Washington, the following passage in the work 1 RusKs Washington in Domestic Life

 of Chief Justice Marshall: "More satisfactory testimony in favor of StSt. Clair is furnished by the circumstance that he still retained the undiminished esteem and good opinion of Washington
" The success of the Indians in this affair inspired them with the hope that they might eventually drive the in- truding whites back across the Ohio
 They resumed the predatory system of warfare against the settlements and were more ferocious than ever before
 To describe the bloody scenes that ensued for twelve months would require a volume for that alone
 The settlers on the Muskingum and the Miamis withdrew within the forts
 General StSt. Clair resigned his commission in the army and General Anthony Wayne was appointed to succeed him
 Congress resolved on the vigorous prosecution of the war
 The military es- tablishment was to be increased to four regiments of in- fantry and a corps of cavalry; the whole, with artillery, to consist of five thousand men
 Profiting now by the disas- trous experience of the past, there was to be no six months' levies, and it was agreed to give the new commander two years in which to raise, equip and discipline his army be- fore moving against the Indians
 Meanwhile, negotiations looking to peace were undertaken by the Secretary of War through Captain Brant
 That astute chieftain accepted the commission, and appeared in public councils as an advo- cate of peace
 If sincere in this new character, the weight of his influence hitherto, and of the present treacherous counsels of Lord Dorchester, Governor of Canada, were still sufficient to lead the Indian Nations to refuse to accept a peace on any other basis than the Ohio River as a boun- dary line
 The court paid to this able chief by the Ameri- can Government during the period that the British held the posts in the West, forms one of the most curious chap- ters in the history of the United States
 While General Wayne was making preparations for the field, negotiations for a peace were continued
 Mr
 Free- man, Major Trueman, and Colonel Hard in, who were dis- patched from Fort Washington, on different routes, in the spring of 1792, with flags of truce and presents, were all

 183 murdered by the Indians
 General Rufus Putman, how- ever, was more successful
 Aided by the Moravian mission- ary Heckewelder, he succeeded in effecting a treaty with the Wabash and Illinois nations, which bound them to peace
 Arrangements had been made with the Indians at Au Glaize in the summer, that commissioners of the United States should attend a conference of the Indian nations in 1793, on the Miami of the lakes
 The com- missioners selected were Benjamin Lincoln, Timothy Pick- ering, and Beverly Randolph
 They went by way of Niagara to confer with Governor Simcoe, and were detained there by fine speeches and feasting until near the middle of July
 They had been invited by the Indians to meet them at Sandusky, but were detained by adverse winds at Fort Erie, and, finally, had to return to Niagara
 In a few weeks, they received a communication from the Indian Nations, which concluded as follows: "Brothers: "We shall be persuaded that you mean to do us justice if you agree that the Ohio shall remain the boundary line between us
 If you will not consent thereto, our meeting will be altogether unnecessary
" This was accepted as the red man's ultimatum, and the commissioners returned without having accomplished their mission
 Thereupon, General Wayne pushed his preparations for war
 General Wilkinson, who was second in command, stationed at Fort Washington, with one thousand meu marched to the scene of St
 Glair's defeat, collected the bones of the victims, and erected on the spot Fort Re- covery
 The garrison stationed here had a sharp conflict with the Indians, under Little Turtle, on the 30th June, 1794, which cost the lives of the commanding officer, Major McMahon, and twenty-one others
 The Indians displayed great courage, and made their attack in as good order as regular troops
 There were among them several officers in British uniform
 On theSth of August, General Wayne marched againstthe Indians
 Profiting by the experience of the past, he moved
Page 184

 with extreme caution and only in superior force
 As the forts had already been built by StSt. Clair, there was nothing to delay him
 He had regular troops thoroughly drilled for this service, and was supported by about eleven hundred mounted Kentuckians under General Scott
 The Indians took up a strong position in some fallen timber under the guns ot the fort at the rapids, recently erected by Governor Simcoe, and thorc awaited the attack from Wayne
 They attempted no surprise, but posted behind the thick wood, rendered almost inaccessible by a dense growth of under- brush and fallen timber, with their left protected by a rocky bank of the river, they thought themselves secure
 They were formed in three lines within supporting distance of each other, extending for two miles at right angles with the river
 General Wayne formed in two lines, the first begin- ning the attack early on the morning of the 20th
 Finding that the Indians were attempting to turn his left flank, he moved his second line to the support of the first, and directed General Scott to turn the enemy's right
 This disposition checked the flanking movement on the part of the Indians
 Wayne simultaneously moved his first line forward with instructions to charge with trailed arms, and rouse the Indians from their covert at the point of the bayonet
1 This charge was made with irresistible impetu- osity, and being followed by a sharp fire, the Indians were completely routed
 Within an hour, the enemy had been driven two miles, and the victory was complete
2 The loss of the Americans in killed and wounded was one hundred and seven
 That of the Indians is unknown, but it must have been very great
 After the battle, there was some sharp correspondence between Major Campbell, commanding the British fort, and General Wayne, which showed bad temper, but as there was no blood spilled it is hardly worthy of mention
 The result of this campaign was a treaty between the United States, represented by General Wayne, and the lLife of Brant, Vol

 The year succeeding the close of the disastrous cam- paign of 1791, was a period of unrest and anxiety to StSt. Clair
 He found the ties that bound him to the people of the East gradually and surely relaxing, and the advantage which had been his on account of his ability and promi- nence in the War of Independence, now that he was ab- sent, was less certain, and might soon disappear altogether before the claims of less deserving men
 A chance seemed to oli'er for him to resain his position
 Tiie representative of the Westmoreland District! having met with some oppo- sition, had indicated a purpose not to stand again as a can- didate for Congress, and it was proposed by the Federalists that StSt. Clair should make the canvass
 The suggestion was eagerly embraced, and the advice of friends freely invited
 To his friend James Ross he confided the delicate task of sounding the political managers, and of deciding on a policy to be adopted
 The names most generally men- tioned were those of Mr
 Todd and Mr
 Smilie
 As the latter was backed by Mr
 Fiuley, it was not thought possible for Mr
 Todd to succeed; if he did, " the public would not be benefited by the change
" Mr
 Ross was warned against Mr
 J , of Grcensburg, who, notwithstanding " his pro- fession to the contrary, was suspected of being at heart a

 187 very Democrat
" It was evident that StSt. Clair longed to be actively employed in the arena of national polities, in which he saw many associates and friends of Revolu- tionary days conspicuously engaged in support of the principles he espoused
 Pennsylvania had not main- tained her rightful position—nay, was degenerating under the dangerous political teachings of Gallatin and others
 To his friend Ross StSt. Clair poured out his heart freely; though his recollections of La Fayette and other French patriots of the Revolution were most tender, he was op- posed to the Gallican party in America
 "I have seen the bill for cutting off' the intercourse with France," said he, "which I hope is a law ere now
 It was a step which should have been taken long ago, but is better late than not at all
 Now let the country be put in a state of defense, and we shall have peace
 One good consequence has flowed already from the firmness and decision of the President and Senate—the d d Faction that were dragging the country to ruin are completely dis- comfited
 I hope, too, the time is not distant when Penn- sylvania—poor, degraded Pennsylvania—under your aus- pices, will regain her position of weight and influence in the Union from which she has been detruded
" And concludes with a fine line from his favorite Horace: "Nil desperandum Teucro cluce el auspice Teucro
1" But StSt. Clair was destined not to share in the leadership at the Capital
 After careful inquiry it was found wiser to adhere to a plan of campaign already outlined by the man- aging Federalists
 This action was what StSt. Clair himself had advised, but it forever cut him off from active partici- pation in all that was most congenial
 Ho left a society which he was so well fitted to adorn, and turned his face again towards the West with reluctance
 The disappoint- ment was even greater to Mrs
 StSt. Clair, who still lingered among the beloved hills of Pennsylvania, and who hoped that some turn in affairs would reunite the family and re- store their fortunes

 While in Philadelphia, in 1792, Governor StSt. Clair looked faithfully after the interests of the people of the North- western Territory
 As he still held to the opinion that the laws framed by the Territorial Legislature did not conform to the Ordinance of 1787, he induced Congress to pass an act giving to the Governor and Judges authority to repeal, at their discretion, the laws hy them made; an authority judiciously exercised later
 This seemed to be the only practical method for correcting the error against which the Governor had protested
 His views on a judicial system, on the practice in England, on the rights of the people, and the duties of magistrates, will he found forcibly stated in the papers and addresses included in this work, and, upon examination, to be the basis of the system of laws estab- lished in 1795—a system, in the language of a distin- guished jurist, "not without many imperfections and blem- ishes; but it may be doubted whether any colony, at so early a period after it's first establishment, ever had one so good

 For the first time, a complete system of government was created for the North-west, by which the blessings promised by the Ordi- nance were realized
 Laws for the regulation of society— subjecting real estate to execution for debt; directing the manner of executing writs of attachment; for the speedy re- covery of small debts; concerning defaleations; for the punishment of larceny; for the limitation of actions; for the recovery of fines and forfeitures: for the settlement of intestates' estates; for assessing and distributing taxes; regulating inclosures; concerning trespassing animals; di- recting how husband and wife may convey their estates; for the speedy assignment of dower; for the partition of land; giving remedies in equity; against forcible entry and detainer; allowing foreign attachments; limiting imprison- ment for debt; governing proceedings in ejectment; sup- 1 Chase

—were adopted
 The judicial sys- tem was so changed as tofix the general court at Marietta and Cincinnati, and a circuit court was established, " with power to try, in the several counties, issues in fact depending before the superior tribunal, where alone causes could be finally decided
" Lastly, as if with a view to create some great reservoir, from which, whatever principles and powers had been omitted in the particular acts might he drawn accord- ing to the exigencies of circumstances, they adopted a law, providing that the common law of England, and all gen- eral statutes in aid of the common law, prior to the fourth year of James I
, should be of full force within the terri- tory
1 StSt. Clair had had this in view from the beginning of his administration, but the opinions of the first Judges were not in harmony with his own
 He believed such legislation warranted by one of the articles of compact of the Ordi- nance, which provides that the people of thcTerritory shall always be entitled to judicial proceeding according to the course of common law
 This statute was subsequently recognized as having the same force as any other adopted law of the Legislature and the bench
2 But, on the other hand, it has been objected, that the Ordinance permitted the adoption of laws only from the then existing laws of the original States, and that this could not warrant the adoption of written and unwritten English law, especially as the Virginia act, upon which it was based, had been re- pealed
3 Again it may be urged in support of the first view, if the action of the Governor and Judges was in technical violation of that provision of the Ordinance regulating the formation of laws, it was in keeping with the spirit of the more important compact already refer- red to, and with the history of all English colonies who made the common law the foundation of free gov- ernments

 selves when resisting the oppressions of George III
1 Whatever benefit could be derived rrom its obligatory recognition in the administration of government and the interpretation of laws, was secured to the people of the North-west by this action of Governor StSt. Clair and the Judges
 If there was wanting the power to legislate, as afterwards held by some, this was cured by the failure of Congress to disapprove of the law
2 The act of Congress which gave to the Territorial Legis- lature this important authority, also empowered a single judge of the general court, in the absence of the others, to hold the terms
 This was intended to remedy the difficulty of securing the attendance of any two Judges at any one point in so vast a territory; but the citizens saw their own interests jeoparded by this change
 Governor StSt. Clair pointed out the danger to the Judges and to the President
 In the Eastern part of the Territory lands had been bought, generally, either of the Ohio or the Miami Company; of the former Judge Putnam was a director, and of the latter Judge Symmes was the sole manager
 Both Judges were members 1" When the difficulties with the home government sprung up, it was a source of immense moral power to the colonists that they were able to show that the rights they claimed were conferred by the com- mon law, and that the King and Parliament were seeking to deprive them of that common birthright of Englishmen
"—Cooley on Constitu- tional Limitations, p

 "These statutes [common law] upon the points which are covered by them are the best evidence possible They are the living charters of English liberty to the present day; and as the forerunners of the American Constitutions and the source from which have been derived many of the most important articles in their bills of rights, they are constantly appealed to when personal liberty or private right are placed in apparent antagonism to the claims of government
"—Ibid

 *" The legislation [by territorial bodies with plenary power], of course, must not be in conflict with the law of Congress conferring the power to legislate, but a variance from it may be supposed approved by that body if suffered to remain without disapproval for a series of years after being duly reported to it

 191 of the Supreme Court
 Every land dispute was liable to be traced to some transaction in which one or the other of them was concerned, and in the hearing they would sit in judgment
 But the danger was increased by giving to a single judge the power of a full bench
 Though never so upright, yet judgment was liable to be affected insensibly by the bias of interest
1 The same vigilance for the protection of the rights of the people is observable in the remarks of Governor StSt. Clair on the motion of Judge Symmes to extend the jurisdiction of a single magistrate in the trial of small causes, not in- volving over twenty dollars
 He pointed out the hardship to the debtor resulting from summary proceedings; the in- crease of litigation through convenience of small courts, and the injury to society as a consequence
 "These evils," said he, " have all proceeded from extending the jurisdiction of single magistrates; and the mischievous influence of it acts with so much regularity, that, knowing the character of a people as litigious or otherwise, you may tell with certainty what is the spirit of their laws; and, contrariwise, know- ing the nature of their laws, you may with absolute cer- tainty infer the character of the people
" "Although" added he, " the administration of justice should certainly be so cheap as that every man may be within the reach of right, it should also be so dear, particularly at the tirst step, as that every body may be deterred from entering into law- suits wantonly, or to gratify a revengeful disposition
" I have thus referred briefly to the more important part of the work of StSt. Clair in laying the foundation of the five republican states which hold to-day such an important place in the Union, for the purpose or calling attention to che ability, versatility, and noble principles of the man
 To re- count in detail his labors in administering the government from 1790 to 1802, is not within the scope of this memoir
 It certainly was not smooth sailing at any time, but there was a period when his efforts were embarrassed in the most exasperating way by subordinates in the War and State De- •StSt. Clair in letter to Secretary of State, December 14, 1794

 partments
 In the former,'Hodgdon, the Quartermaster- General, who had been largely responsible for the results of the Indian campaign of 1791, seemed to have a controlling in- fluence; and after Mr
 Jefferson left the State Department, that baleful influence was mysteriously extended
 But for his regard for General Washington, StSt. Clair would have sent in his resignation
 He finally stated the facts to the President in a private letter, and there was a speedy inter- ference for his relief from headquarters, and it was so im- perative that during the remainder of Washington's admin- istration and the administration of Adams, he was treated with the respect to which he was entitled
 The unfortunate French who had been led to seek for a new paradise on the bunks of the Ohio; the destitute in- habitants of the ancient posts on the Wabash and Missis- sippi, and the settlements of the Revolutionary soldiers, caused StSt. Clair the greatest anxiety, and required efforts for their relief and protection that were almost superhuman
 He made repeated journeys from one part of the Territory to another, sleeping upon the ground or in an open boat, and living upon coarse and uncertain fare
 At one time he traveled in this manner a distance of five thousand miles, without the means of protection against inclement weather, and without rest
 These hardships proved a severe strain upon his constitution, and attacks of the gout were more frequent than formerly
 In the winter of 1794-95, he was prostrated with a fever which brought him within view of the silent land
 And yet the exigencies of his office did not permit him to omit any personal attentions
 After the treaty of Greenville, the tide of emigration wns to the North-west
 New settlements appeared upon the Muskingnm, the Scioto, on the Miami even as far up as the Mad River, on the Wabash, on the Illinois, and the Mis- sissippi
 In the north-eastern part of the territory a new light appeared
 The 4th of July, 1796, was celebrated on Conneaut (Conneanght) Creek, in New Connecticut land, by General Moses Cleveland and companions, who had come from the rugged hills of Old Connecticut to survey that part of her Western Reserve lying east of Cuyahoga River

 193 They were the first English-speaking people to take posses- sion
1 Connecticut had, with characteristic prudence, when the cessions of lands were being made by the States, reserved to herself a large section west of Pennsylvania
 The west- ern part of this, to the extent of half a million of acres, was granted to those of her citizens who had suffered by depredations of the British during the Revolutionary War, and the remainder, supposed to contain about three million acres, was sold
 General Cleveland appeared as the general agent of the Connecticut Land Company, and conducted his operations from the east bank of the Cuyahoga, near Lake Erie
2 The purchase of General Samuel II
 Parsons, near the Mahoning River, known as the ''Salt Spring Tract," fflade in 1788, also attracted the attention of the settlers
 This progress of civilization required the extention of the Government, and new counties were erected as rapidly as consistent with the public welfare
 In 1795, Governor StSt. Clair issued a proclamation for di- viding St
 Cluir county, which was too large for the trans- action of public business
 The part lying south of a line running from the Mississippi through New Design due east to the Wabash was designated as the county of Randolph — a graceful compliment to the distinguished statesman of Virginia, who had given the weight of his support to the Federal Constitution at an important crisis, and who was a member of Washington's cabinet
 
 Upon the surrender of the posts on the lakes by the Brit- ish, the Detroit country was set apart as the county of Wayne — being appropriately named after the victorious general who had won peace from the Indians, and forever extinguished the hopes of the British commanders of a new confederacy which should embrace Canada and the North- west
 Adams, Jefferson, and Ross were soon after formed in the same manner, the first and third embracing all of the Sci- 3 Early History of Cleveland, p

 oto country, in which great numbers of settlers were locating lands, and the second the section between Pennsylvania and a line extending from the mouth of the Cuyahoga to the Muskingum
 It will be observed that Governor StSt. Clair, in making choice of names and recognizing eminent char- acters, was equally happy in exhibiting a spirit of magna- nimity and paying a tribute to friendship
 At last, StSt. Clair was moved to undertake a land enter- prise, and, in 1795, in company with Senator Jonathan Dayton and Israel Ludlow, of New ,'Jersey, and General James Wilkinson, contrncted with John Cleves Symmes for the purchase and settlement of the seventh and eighth ranges, between Mad River and the Little Miami
 The survey was completed after much trouble, and on the 4th of November Israel Ludlow laid out a town, which was called Dayton, from the name of one of the proprietors
 Judge Symmes being unable to complete his payments and make title to what he had sold, the land reverted to the Gov- ernment, and StSt. Clair did not profit by his undertaking
 Daniel C
 Cooper, who had assisted in making the survey, partly hy the acquisition of pre-emption rights, and partly by agreement with the settlers, became the titular proprie- tor of the town
1 The act which permitted the holding of the Supreme Court by a single judge was productive of many unpleas- ant complications, which taxed the address and patience of the Governor sorely to adjust
 Congress had made no pro- vision for the payment of the expenses of the officers and to carry out the provisions of the Ordinance for the estab- lishment of the government over so vast a territorv, and the instructions of the President for the relief of the French inhabitants, would consume, in traveling expenses alone, 1 Curwen's Sketch, p

 Nineteen families removed from Cincinnati and formed the settlement of Dayton
 Among these settlers were Benjamin and William Van Cleve, and the three brothers McClure, tfames, John, and Thomas
 The failure of Symmes and the transfer to Cooper led to a good deal of litigation, in which Dayton, Lndlow, StSt. Clair, and Cooper were par- ties

 195 their salaries
 The first Judges declined to go with the Governor and Secretary to the Far West, and StSt. Clair was never able to secure at any point beyond Cincinnati a full court
 He met the emergency well and prudently, but the responsibility was irksome, and it required a sacrifice of time and strength he should never have been called on to make at bis time of life
 Judge Turner, who was arrogant and dictatorial in the extreme, succeeded, both at Post Vineemies and Kaskaskia, in putting every body by the ears, and necessitated the active interference of the Governor to quiet the storm
 He pur- posed having Henry Vanderburg, judge of probate and justice, impeached for some informality in the administra- tion of office; and in the Mississippi country he removed William StSt. Clair, clerk of the court of StSt. Clair county, for presuming to keep the records of the court at Cahokia instead of Kaskaskia
 The Governor, in order to accom- modate the inhabitants, had provided that the courts should be held at stated periods, at three different places, and the clerk of the court, in the same spirit, kept the books of record at Cahokia, where they were accessible to the great- est number of land-owners
 But Judge Turner, without authority, directed that Kaskaskia should be the only county- seat, and, without waiting for an explanation, in the most ar- bitrary manner, commanded the clerk to produce the books, within twelve hours, at that place
 He also, without au- thority, appointed a Mr
 Jones assistant clerk, and placed the books in his possession
 The Governor required Wil- liam StSt. Clair to assert his rights, and rebuked Judge Turner for his high-handed proceedings
 Subsequently, the inhabitants of the Mississippi country preferred charges of oppression and corruption against the Judge, to the Sec- retary of State, which, in due course, were referred to Con- gress for proceedings in impeachment
 The committee, to whom the matter was referred, repqrted that, on account of distance and difficulty in commanding the attendance of witnesses, it -would be better to have the investigation con- ducted within the Territory
 Accordingly, the papers were
Page 196

 sent to Governor StSt. Clair, with instructions to make in- quiry, and report
1 Another embarrassment arose in the Governor's inability to find a competent lawyer to accept of the office of At- torney-General for the Territory
 The remuneration waa so precarious no fit person practicing before the courts conld be induced to undertake it
 There was necessity for such an officer, and, in the emergency, the Governor, in 1796, prevailed on his son, Arthur StSt. Clair, Jr
, a promis- ing young attorney at Pittsburgh, to remove to Cincinnati and take the office
 This was an unfortunate step, as it was at great personal sacrifice on the part of the son, and subjected the Governor to unjust criticism, some years later, when party passions were aroused in an effort to ob- tain political control
 Young StSt. Clair directly gained a a position of prominence and influence in the Territory, due entirely to superior abilities and an agreeable address
 In contemporary correspondence and publications he is re- ferred to in terms of respect
 A subject, which attracted some attention during these formative years, was the extending of excise duties on spirituous liquors of domestic production to the Territories as a part of the United States
 Persons selling foreign liquors were required to take out a license
 This was ex- tending the revenue system to the Territories, and was taxation without representation
 It met with little other opposition than harmless criticism, but there were not wanting evasions
 The Attorney-General supplied the Secretary of the Treasury with an opinion that the Fourth Article of Compact of the Ordinance extended all of the acts of Congress to the Territory
 StSt. Clair, in a letter to Oliver Woleott, controverted this view
 He took the ground that the Fourth Article was intended to apply to the States that should be formed out of tVie Territory when admitted into the Union on an equality with the 1American State Papers
 Annah of Congress
 Jndge Turner himself went to Philadelphia and nsked to be heard, But his petition was laid on the table
 The matter was referred back to the Territory, but was never heard from again

 197 original States, and not while in a territorial condition; that, if intended otherwise, the people would have been given a representation, a participation in the benefits of the general government, and that the judicial powers of the government would have been extended over the Territory
 The attempt in the Congress of 1792-93 to extend the law imposing a duty on spirits distilled within the United States to the Territory North-west of the river Ohio, failed, notwithstandmg it was earnestly pressed by the adminis- tration
1 In 1794, an act was pass"d authorizing the Presi- dent to erect revenue districts and appoint collectors therefor "in the Territories North-west and South of the river Ohio," in order to facilitate and secure the collection of revenue on distilled spirits and stills
 It extended the jurisdiction of the "judicial courts " of the Territories to all cases originating under the act
2 For several years after the passage of the Ordinance, the country lying west of the Allegheny range had an uncertain status
 The three leading European powers regarded it by no means desirable or essential that it should become a part of the Republic, and thoy intrigued to prevent that consummation
 We have seen how the British retained the posts, and encouraged Brunt in his efforts to form an In- dian confederacy whose eastern limits should be the Ohio; and how, growing bolder, Mr
 John Connolly was dis- patched by the Canadian authorities to Kentucky to per- tuade the people that they were being sacrificed by the people of the East, and that their darling object — the free navigation of the Mississippi — could be best secured through an alliance with His Britannic Majesty
 Mr
 Con- nolly's visit was well timed — as he supposed
 It chanced that the inhabitants south of the Ohio, in the exercise of that freedom believed to bo a part of the inalienable rights of American citizens, fancying their interests were being neglected by the general government, talked a great deal and threatened dire consequences if something were not Life of Washington, Vol

 immediately done to secure unrestricted commerce on the inland waters
 Mr
 Connolly found out how much im- portance should be attached to such popular gasconade, for directly he hinted the nature of his mission, he was invited to leave for Canada by the shortest route
 But Spain attempted a bolder stroke
 That government formed the design of detaching the Western settlements from the Union, and erecting them into an independent state, under the protection of the Spanish King
 The in- ducement held out was the free navigation of the Missis- sippi
 To promote the scheme several influential citizens of Kentucky were pensioned, and settlements on the hanks of the Mississippi were promoted by donations of land
 The correspondence of the day shows that many Americans were attracted by these advantageous offers, and the occu- pation of the land north of the Ohio was greatly retarded thereby
 But the emigrants did not take kindly to Span- ish domination, and many of them removed to the North- western Territory or to Kentucky
 The settlement at New Madrid, which was, perhaps, the most prominent, was abandoned early
 This Spanish intrigue is traced to the year 1787, when the Kentuckians became greatly alarmed at a report that Mr
 Jay had proposed to concede the exclusive control of the Mississippi to Spain for a series of years
 A delegate meeting was called for the following year
 It was held as advertised, and an address to Congress issued in which the natural right of the people to navigate the Mississippi was asserted, and a demand made for the forcible protection of that right, if necessary
 Prior to this, in February, 17
W8, Kentucky had petitioned for admission into the Union and had been refused
 It was while the people were thus ex- cited that the suggestion was insidiously made for them to act independently, and receive from Spain the privilege of conducting an unrestricted commerce down the rivers to the Gulf
 Hon
 John Brown, a member of the old Continental Congress, had been selected to present this petition, and on making a report of his failure to the convention above referred to, sitting at Danville, he did not speak confidently

 199 » of the future prospects of Kentucky
 In a letter to Judge Muter, he said he did not think that the Eastern States would ever assent to the admission of Kentucky into the Union as an independent State, unless Vermont or Maine were brought forward at the same time; that there was a jealousy of the growing importance of the West; and that it was generally expected that the district would declare its independence, and proceed to frame a constitution of gov- ernment
 He then added: "This step will, in my opinion, tend to preserve unanimity, and will enahle you to adopt, with effect, such measures as may be necessary to promote the interest of the district
 In private conversation with Mr
 Gardoqui, the Spanish minister at this place [New York], I have been assured by him in the most explicit terms, that if Kentucky will declare her independence, and empower some person to negotiate with him, that he has authority, and will engage to open the navigation of the Mississippi for the exportation of their produce, on terms of mutual advantage
 But that this privilege can never be extended to them while part of the United States, by reason of commercial treaties existing between that court and other powers of Europe
" l There was strong temptation in this
 The Union was little more than a rope of sand
 What could it do for a people isolated as were those of the West? If independent, what could they not do for themselves? The situation was afterwards graphically described by General Wilkinson: "The people of the West were open to savage depredations; exposed to the jealousies of the Spanish government; un- protected by that of the old confederation; and denied the free navigation of the Mississippi, the only practicable channel by which the products of their labor could find a market
"2 Thus situated, there was a free expression of opinion at the Danville meeting not at all inconsistent with their attachment to a republican government, but which has, since the blessings of the Union became fully realized, 1See Butler's History of Kentucky, p

 • been magnified into something more serious, for partisan designs
 The purpose of the Spanish government is clear enough, but it is quite as certain that only a very few Americans sympathised with that purpose
 It would seem that the communication thus opened im- proved the business interests of the Kentuckians
 One of the first persons to attempt a mercantile venture at this time was General James Wilkinson
 He shipped a cargo of tobacco to New Orleans, and by his address secured a contract with the Spanish Governor for a regular supply, not only of this product, but of flour and bacon, the gov- ernment to be the purchaser of all he might send
 Wilkinson had settled in Kentucky after the close of the Revolutionary War, and established himself as a merchant
 His agreeable manners and superior talents placed him in the front as a leader in all public affairs
 "Was an address to be written, which should pour forth the feelings of Ken- tucky, a debate to be opened on her vital interests, Wilkin- son was equally the author of the one and the speaker of the other
 So varied, rich, and polished were the powers and acquirements of this singularly versatile person, that whether in the iield of Saratoga, the cabinet of Governor Miro, or in the conventions of the backwoodsmen of Ken- tucky, he drew all eyes upon him, and was looked up to as a leader and chief
''1 Wilkinson's mercantile expedition was a fortunate one for Kentucky
 "Previous to that time all those who ventured on the Mississippi had their property seized by the first commanding officer whom they met, and little or no com- munication was kept up between the countries
"2 The military reputation of Wilkinson carried his property be- yond the petty officers to New Orleans, where, although at first seized by the Intendant, it was permitted to be sold without payment of duty
 Wilkinson had followed his property closely, and ho so played upon the fears of Gov- ernor Miro, that advantageous terms of trade were ac- 1 Rutter's History of Kentucky, p

 201 corded
 "This changed the face of things, and was pro- ductive of a new line of conduct on the part of the Span- iards
" 1 But this success came near wrecking Wilkinson's future prospects
 He was accused of being a party to the Spanish intrigue for a separation of Kentucky from the Union; hut no distinct proof in support of the charge was ever ad- duced,2 and we may fairly conclude that the accusation had its origin in jealousy and party policy
 When the at- tempts of the Spaniards were renewed later, Wilkinson was in command of the United States forces in the North- western Territory, and although he received communica- tions from below, his conduct was strictly in the interest of the government
 In 1793, Citizen Genet, besides other extraordinary things, attempted to enlist an army in the Western country for the invasion of Louisiana, and,-which is not the least remarkable of the events of this period, he obtained the consent of George Rogers Clark to command the expedi- tion as "a Major-General in the Armies of France, and Commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Legions on the Mississippi
" The French Government not doubting that the American Republic would make common cause with France, provided Genet with blank commissions, which were to be filled up for those officers who would join the army
 The President had issued a proclamation of neu- trality, but nothing daunted, Citizen Genet addressed him- self directly to the real sovereigns of America
 He met with hearty sympathy from a small number of prominent politicians, including Mr
 Jefferson, Governor Mifflin and Chief Justice McKean, of Pennsylvania
 In Philadelphia a "Democratic Society" in imitation of the famous clubs of Paris, was formed

 tion, the zealous agents of Genet repaired to the Western country to spread the true democracy
 A society was organ- ized in Lexington, and Kentucky was soou filled with enthusiasm for the French cause
 President Washington early advised Governors StSt. Clair and Shelby of the projected movement, and communicated to them the names of the agents1 dispatched from Phila- delphia by the French Minister to put his plans into execu- tion
 These men found no such sympathy north as south of the Ohio
 Governor StSt. Clair promptly issued a pro- clamation, informing the citizens of the contemplated invasion of the Spanish territory, and warning them of the dangerous consequences of participating in it
 Governor Slu-lby took no public recognition of the communication of the President, and when advised by Governor StSt. Clair of the movements of General Clark and the French agents, did not attempt to interfere
 To Mr
 Jefferson, Secretary of State, he expressed this sympathetic opinion: "I have great doubts even if they attempt to carry this plan into execution, provided they manage their business with pru- dence, whether there is any legal authority to restrain or to punish them; at least before they have actually accom- plished it
"2 In the same paper in which was published Governor StSt. Clair's proclamation, appeared the call of General Clark for recruits, but the latter was careful to keep beyond the official reach of the Governor
 Quite a number of venture- some characters crossed over the river and joined the French army, which, however, was destined never to draw 1 Charles Delpeau, Maturin, La Chaise, and Oignoux
 It surprised Citizen Genet that it should be considered an offense for these men to engage American citizens in a war against another power with which the United States were at peace; or for Americans to enlist in the armies of France
 "Do not," said he to Jefferson, "punish the bravo individuals of your nation, who arrange themselves under our banner, knowing perfectly well that no law of the United States gives to the Government the sad power of arresting their zeal by acts of rigor

 203 Spanish blood
 In the following year the President issued a proclamation, warning the officers of their peril in enlist- ing men to make war on a nation with which the United States were at peace; and soon after instructed General Wayne to send " a detachment to take post at Fort Massac; and to erect a strong redoubt and block-house, with some suitable cannon from Fort Washington
" Major Thomas Doyle was intrusted with the execution of the order, which was carried into effect in the spring
 Congress passed an act covering violations of neutrality, and, discouraged by such obstacles, Genet abandoned the projected invasion of Spanish territory
 Thus, unforeseen events prevented two thousand brave Kentuckians, in the language of Monsieur La Chaise, from taking from the despotic usurping Spaniards by force, under the flag of the French republic, the empire of the Mis- sissippi, breaking the chains of the Americans and their brethren, the French, and laying "the foundation of the prosperity and happiness of two nations, destined by nature to be but one, the most happy in the universe
" Out of this attempt of the French minister to violate the neutrality of the United States, grew the most violent party divisions
 There had been a strong Gallican spirit mani- fe
sted in opposition to a treaty with Great Britian, but it broke out now with redoubled fury
 This feeling extended to the West
 On the 24th of May, 1794, a numerously- attended meeting at Lexington adopted resolutions, "ex- pressive of unqualified censure upon the administration of Washington, mixing all the difficulties and perplexities at- tending the Indian war, British outrages, and Spanish pro- crastination, in one mass of condemnation
1" Although the people of the North-west were closely associated with those of Kentucky in many wnys, yet the prevailing sentiment was iu support of the administration
 The feeling of oppo- sition was intensified by the course of Great Britain in sub- jecting American vessels to search
 When, however, an understanding was reached with that Government, France 1 Butler's History of Kentucky, p

 charged the United States with a breach of friendship, uu abandonment of neutrality, and a violation of engage- ments, and, thereupon, concluded an
 alliance, offensive and defensive, with Spain
 Out of this gre\v new trouble for the West
 At the in- stance of France, Spain complained to the American Gov- ernment that the British treaty had sacrificed her interests as well as those of France, and made this a ground for de- laying the running of a boundary line and the delivery of the posts on the Mississippi, as stipulated in the treaty of 1795
 In July of that very year, Thomas Power, an ngent of Governor Carondelet, delivered a letter to Judge Benja- min Sebastian, of Kentucky, which contained the inform- ation that the King of Spain was "willing to open the navigation of the Mississippi to the Western country, and desirous to establish certain regulations, reciprocally bene- iicinl to the commerce of both countries," and an invitation to appoint agents to conduct negotiations at New Madrid
 Subsequently, Judge Sebastian met the Spanish commis- sioner, as agreed upon, but before the business was conclu- ded, word was received from Havana that a treaty had been signed, which put an end to the business
 This, however, did not end the Spanish intrigue, which was renewed after the alliance with France
 Early in 1797, there was great activity noticed among the Spaniards at their upper posts on the Mississippi, which Governor StSt. Clair reported to the Secretary of War
 The Indians were being tampered with, and inducements held out for them to desert the Americans and join the interests of Spain
 In June, Thomas Power again appeared on the scene as a bearer of a letter from Governor Carondelet to General Wilkinson, who was found at Detroit
 This letter asked the General to delay the march of the American troops for the posts on the Mississippi until the adjustment of certain questions which were then pending between the governments of the United States and Spain
 General Wilkinson declined to comply, and sent Power back to New Madrid in care of Captain Shaumburgh
 The emissary said in a letter to Don Manuel Gayoso, Spanish Governor

 205 at Natchez, that Wilkinson declared that the project was chimerical; that the inhabitants of the Western States hav- ing obtained all they desired, would not wish to form any other political or commercial alliances; and that they had no motive for separating themselves from the interests of the other States of the Union, even if France and Spain should make them the most advantageous offers
" Spain professing to fear that Great Britain would send an expedition from Canada through the North-western Terri- tory against the province of Louisiana, President Adams, February 4, 1798, instructed General Wilkinson to employ the force tinder him to oppose the British or other foreign nation "who should presume to attempt a violation of the territory of the United States, by an expedition through it against their enemies
" All pretexts for delay being ex- hausted, Spain now reluctantly carried out the provisions of the treaty, and on the 5th of October, 1798, General Wilkinson established his headquarters at Loftus' Heights, on the left bank of the Mississippi, six miles north of the thirty-first degree of north latitude
 Here he erected Fort Adams, which completely commanded the Mississippi
 Thus the free navigation of that mighty stream was se- cured to the people of the North-west, and the first step taken towards its complete possession
 The further remark may be made in this connection, that, through these events and the retaliatory measures adopted by the American Government, party divisions were estab- lished in the North-western Territory, and political discus- sions became as violent and party methods as objectionable as in the more populous East
 We shall see to what extent they were carried, and shall have abundant leisure to mor- alize on the uncertainty of political ties
 Meanwhile the Territory was strongly for the administration
 The question of slavery proved to be one of great em- barrassment in the administration of the Government
 The Sixth Article was regarded as a menace by the ancient in- habitants at Post Yincennes, as well as in the Illinois country, and quite a number, as has been seen, removed to the Spanish territory with their slaves
 Those that re-

 niained behind presented a statement of the situation to Governor StSt. Clair, and asked his opinion
 The Governor declared it to be bis opinion that the Sixth Article of the Ordinance was not retroactive-; that it was " a declaration of a principle which was to govern the legisla- ture in all acts respecting that matter, and the courts of justice in their decisions in eases arising after the date of the Ordinance
" Retroactive laws were repugnant to free governments, and in most of the United States were for- bidden
 If Congress had intended the immediate abolition of slavery, compensation would have been made to the owners; but " they had the right to determine that prop- erty of that kind afterwards acquired should not be pro- tected in future, and that slaves imported into the Territory after that declaration might reclaim their freedom
" This opinion was accepted as the true interpretation of the Ordinance in the different stages of government
 To many of the present day this may savor of extreme conservatism, and seem to disregard that higher law which refuses to recognize property rights in human beings
 But an official charged with a trust, must execute it according to the letter and in the spirit of the law
 This is what StSt. Clair did in the case of complications arising under the Sixth Article of compact
 "When the time came for chang- ing the form of government forthe eastern part of the Ter- ritory, he became the leader of the opposition to the move- ment to secure a suspension of the Sixth Article, and its defeat was largely due to his eloquent protests in public addresses

 In 1798, Winthrop Sargent, having been appointed Gov- ernor of the new territory of Mississippi, resigned the office of Secretary, and was succeeded by William Henry Harrison
 The loss of his Secretary was keenly felt by Governor StSt. Clair
 Although they differed widely in temperament and character—the one being ostentatious, reserved, and formal: the other, " plain and simple in his dress; open and frank in his manners; and accessible to persons of every rank"1—yet they had been friends on the tented field and in civil life, and Sargent, admiring the talents and courage of his chief, had always been faithful to his interests
 On the other hand, StSt. Clair stood loyally by his friend, although sometimes he felt severely his want of tact and prudence
 Between the Governor and the new Secretary there were no such ties—no bond of sympathy

 They belonged to opposite schools
 The one was growing gray; was accustomed to deference from others; and held tenaciously to the political opinions formed amid the surg- ing elements of revolution in the camp of Washington
 The other, young and ambitious, wiis ready to sympathize with any movement that had for its object the changing of the old for n new order of things
 Hence, it soon came to pass that the Secretary formed plans about which he did not consult the Governor
 It having been ascertained that the Territory contained a population of five thousand white male inhabitants, and was therefore entitled, under the provisions of the Or- dinance, to a change in the form of government, Governor StSt. Clair took the necessary action to effect it
 He issued a proclamation calling on the legal voters to elect Repre- sentatives to a General Assembly, and designating Cincin- nati as the place of meeting
 Under the Ordinance, only freeholders, in fee-simple, of fifty acres within the Territory, had the right to vote; and their selection of Representatives was restricted to freeholders of two hundred acres
 The Representatives convened at the appointed place on the 4th of February, 1799
 Their duty at this meeting was the selection of ten freeholders of five hundred acre?, to be re- turned by the Governor to the President of the United States, from whom were to be appointed, in the manner prescribed in other cases, five persons to constitute a legis- lative council
 After this form was complied with, the Representatives adjourned to meet at Cincinnati on the 16th of September, and the Governor transmitted the ten names to the President, who in due time appointed and commissioned the five to be members of the Council
 By this change the authority of the Governor was strengthened
 He retained his general executive control, the right to make appointments of subordinate oflicers, and had an absolute negative on all legislative acts; while before he rightly claimed that the Governor must be one of the majority adopting laws, yet as that view was contro- verted by the Judges, he acquiesced in legislation that did not meet his approval
 But under the new form of gov-
Page 209

Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair
 209 eminent the Ordinance clothed him with an absolute veto
 On the day appointed there was not a quorum present, and it was not until the 24th of September that the two houses were organized and ready to proceed to business
 On the following day Governor StSt. Clair met them in the Representatives' Chamber, "and in a very eloquent ad- dress l" referred to the change in the form of government, and the subjects which would claim their attention
 His opening words captured all hearts: "It is with much pleasure," said he, "that I meet you now in General As- sembly, an event that has been looked forward to by the people with some anxiety, and not without reason, having been hitherto governed by laws adopted or made by per- sons in whose appointment they had no participation, and over whom they had no control; the wish to be withdrawn from under that authority, and that the laws which were to direct their conduct and protect their property should be made by their own representatives, was very natural, and I congratulate them and you, gentlemen, that you are now met for that purpose
" Nevertheless, he expressed his con- viction that the system which had been superseded was "full of wisdom and benignity," aud adapted to the origi- nal circumstances of the Territory
 He then proceeded to lay before them a full description of the condition of the Territory, and "recommended to their attention such measures as he believed were proper to advance the prosperity and happiness of the people
" He pointed out the defects of the system of laws that had been adopted, and advised legislative action for their amendment or confirmation
 The necessity for meeting any expense incident to the change, called for the early enactment of revenue laws; an efficient military law was essential to the order and protection of the people; and as "the benefits that result from early education and due instruction in the principles of religion are of immense value to every coun- try," he urged that action be taken to make available the 1 Burnet's Notes, p

210 Life and Public Sernces of Arthur StSt. Clair
 generous provisions for them set apart by Congress, which, he said, " might be done through trustees empowered by Congress to dispose of the lauds
" In the same spirit, he called attention to the importance of restraining the traffic in intoxicating liquors; of prohibiting usury; of carrying out that provision of the Ordinance requiring the Legisla- ture to pass laws founded in justice and humanity for pro- tecting the Indians in their property, rights, and liberty, and for preventing wrongs being done to them; and providing for the local administration of the laws
 A delegate to Congress should also be chosen
 He introduced his fa- vorite topic of the common law in the following words: "The statute laws of England that were in force in the American colonies of a later date than the fourth year of Kinf James I
 have not been adopted here, whereby the people are deprived of many excellent regulations in use in the United States, and praticularly of the celebrated Writ of Habeas Corpus, which was not brought into practice until the reign of Charles II
, and is justly considered as the best security against illegal and oppressive imprison- in crs that was ever invented
 It may be proper that all of them, down to the time of the Revolution, which are not inconsistent with the principles then embraced, should be declared to be laws in the Territory
" He concluded in the following language, which rises to the importance of the theme, and has seldom been excelled in state papers: "The providing for and the regulating the lives and morals of the present and of the rising generation, for the repression of vice and immorality, and for the pro- tection of virtue and innocence, for the security of property and the punishment of crimes, is a sublime employment
 Every aid in my power will be afforded, and I hope we shall bear in mind that the character and deportment of the peo- ple and their happiness, both here and hereafter, depend very much upon the genius and spirit of their laws
" The General Assembly cordially responded to this ad- dress, and tqansacted the business of the session in the same spirit
 The views of the Governor were fully carried out, as the legislation of the session shows
 How this wa»

 211 done, deserves to be more fully related
 It is an interest- ing fact (and mentioned here because we are describing the beginning of government in the North-west), that, although the General Assembly was composed of men of ability, some of whom had been well, if not thoroughly educated, yet the work of framing the most important of the laws devolved almost entirely on Jacob Burnet, a member of the Council
 Mr
 Burnet was of Scotch descent, a native of New Jersey, and a graduate of Princeton College
 He was thoroughly read in the law, and had acquired a large practice in the Territory
 He possessed a judicial mind, and expressed himself with perspicuity
 Now, after nearly a century has elapsed, and the work is passed in review, it must be regarded as a happy circumstance- that Jacob Bur- net was a member of that first Legislature
 Not only were laws passed on the important subjects mentioned by the Governor and the territorial code of the first stage confirmed, but a deficiency—provisions for the partition of real estate; assignment of dower; relief of insol- vent debtors; settlement of disputes by arbitration ; divorce and alimony; equitable set-off, and execution of real con- tracts—was supplied
1 Two notable memorials were re- ceived and acted on during this session: One from the French inhabitants of the Wabash and Mississippi, setting forth the difficulties growing out of the early custom of in- closing their small farms by a common frnce, and asking legislative relief
 A law was passed to regulate the inclos- ing and cultivating of common fields
 The other memorial was from Continental officers of the Virginia line, for whom a district had been reserved between the Scioto and Little Miami rivers, asking to be permitted to remove to their lands with their slaves
 The petition was rejected
 Hap- pily the Ordinance stood in the way of the granting of any such privilege
 But we are assured by Judge Burnet, that, even without the compact prohibiting slavery, such was the public feeling, the request would have been denied by the legislature by a unanimous vote
 "They were not only opposed to slavery on the ground of its being a moral evil, 1 Journal of Legislative Council

 in violation of personal right, but were of opinion, that, whatever might be its immediate advantages, it would ulti- mately retard the settlement, and check the prosperity of the Territory, by making labor less reputable, and creating feelings and habits unfriendly to the simplicity and industry they desired to encourage and perpetuate
" Very decided action was taken on the question of juris- diction between the Territory and the State of Kentucky, to which Governor StSt. Clair had" early called the attention of the President
 Kentucky, from the organization of the North-western Territory, had claimed jurisdiction on the north side of the Ohio to high water mark, on the ground that the deed of cession from Virginia was for the lauds north of the river
 The claim even went further; that when the river, at a high stage, passed a portion of its water through a bayou, or over low ground, into the main stream below, the ground so separated was an island, within the meaning of the act of cession, the jurisdiction and soil of which was vested in Kentucky
 Hence persons " arrested by territorial officers for crimes committed on board of boats lying at the north shore, were released on habeas corpus, or discharged on pleas to the jurisdiction of the Territorial Courts
" This conflict led to great embarrassment and the constant defeat of justice
 To meet this, a bill was passed by a unanimous vote and approved of bv the Governor, af- firming the right of Concurrent jurisdiction, and legalizing the services of process, civil and criminal, on any river
 or water-course, within, or bounding the Territory
 "While this relieved the courts it did not settle the question
 Some years Inter Kentucky revived the dispute
 An examination was then made of the entire legislation of Virginia by Mr
 Burnet
 He found that Virginia in 1789, in authorizing the district of Kentucky to form a separate government, had provided in one of the compacts of the act, " that the State to be formed in the district, should never claim the exclusive jurisdiction on the Ohio river; but that it should be forever common to them and to the people and States on the opposite side
" These conditions were agreed to by the people of Kentucky and embodied in the State Consti-

 213 tution
 Thus it was found that Virginia had treated alike the territories north and south of the river
 This same pretense of exclusive jurisdiction, was made to do service years afterwards when the Fugitive Slave Law was being enforced
 Towards the close of the session, the General Assembly Adopted a highly eulogistic address to President Adams
 It was the production of the pen of Mr
 Burnet, and con- tained strong meat for those'of the new party, five of whom were found to vote against it in the House
 It contained this allusion to the treaty of 1783, and to the Territory North-west of the Ohio: "to your firmness we attribute the enjoyment of the rich country we now inhabit
" And this to his administration: "Permit us, sir, to assure you, that we are duly impressed with a sense of the wisdom, justice, and firmness with which you have discharged this impor- tant trust;" and, " We believe that, regardless of the voice of party spirit, which has striven to destroy our National Counsels, you have kept the honor and happiness of the United States constantly in view; and we ardently pray that the wise Ruler of Nations may preserve your health and life
" To Governor StSt. Clair was assigned the pleasing task of communicating this address to the President
 He per- formed his part in his usual graceful manner: "In that, Sir," wrote StSt. Clair, "they imposed a very agreeable duty upon me: for the sentiments appeared to be such as were proper for them to express, and having pub- licly expressed them, the individuals will find themselves prompted (had they no better motives, and I hope and be- lieve they have many better,) by the desire so natural to men of leading others to think as they do, to propagate them among their constituents; and nothing can be more agree- able to me than bemg made the channel through which the testimonies of confidence and respect, and of attachment toward you are conveyed
 I trust a short time only will elapse before they are common to the whole American people

 A wish that must have gratified John Adams; but the five members of the House who did not approve the sentiments formed the leaven that changed the polities of the North-western Territory, and, in due season, sent the Governor back to the hills of Pennsylvania
 Notwithstanding the personal relations between the Governor and the members of the General Assembly were of the most cordial nature, yet they differed 
as to where the power was lodged for the erection of new counties, and the establishment of county seats
 StSt. Clair held that the Ordinance had placed it exclusively in the Executive
 The others, that in case of new counties to be formed from those originally erected by the Governor, it belonged of right to the General Assembly
 'Bills for the erection of six new counties had been passed by the Legislature and vetoed by the Governor
 This action provoked a remon- strance, addressed to Congress, against the unqualified veto given to the Governor, and led to an unhappy contro- versy, which ended only when the Eastern District was admitted as a State
 Before being prorogued by the Governor the General Assembly issued an address to their constituents, in which they reviewed their labors; referred to the provision made by Congress for education, and concluded with this incite- ment to moral duty: "'Religion, morality and knowledge are necessary to all good governments
' Let us, therefore, inculcate the principle of humanity, benevolence, honesty and punctuality in dealings, sincerity, charity and all the social affections
1" The election of a Delegate to Congress resulted in the choice of William Henry Harrison, by a vote of eleven to ten cast for Arthur StSt. Clair, Jr
 The office of Secretary of State again became vacant, and was filled by the appoint- ment of Charles Willing Byrd, on the 30th of December
 Mr
 Harrison made an active representative in Congress
 He secured the adoption of a resolution to subdivide the surveys of the public lands, anc^-to have them ottered for 1 Journal Legislative Council, 1799

 215 sale in small tracts—a measure of vital interest to the set- tlers, many of whom under the system which left the retailing of lands to the control of speculators, had been unable to obtain homesteads, and were excluded from the privilege of participating in the political affairs of the Territory
 He also secured an extension of the time of paj'ment, for those who had obtained pre-emption rights to lands previously bought of Judge Symmes, lying north of his patent
 Mr
 Harrison was made chairman of a committee to re- port a plan for a division of the North-western Territory
 On May 28,1800, Governor StSt. Clair addressed him a letter recommending that the division be made into three districts —the first with the Scioto as the western boundary, and Marietta as the seat of government; the second, whose west- ern boundary should be a line drawn from that part of the Indian boundary opposite the Kentucky, with Cincinnati as the capital; and the third, all of the Territory lying west of the Middle District, with Post Vincennes as the seat of government
 This division to be only temporary until there should be a population sufficient to cary out the pro- visions of the Ordinance for the erection of states
 But it was objected that this would delay the formation of a State from the Eastern district, and, Mr
 Harrison being in the interest of the State party, the division was made into two districts
 The new district known as Indiana Territory, was organized with Mr
 Harrison as Governor, and Colonel Jobn Gibson, of Pennsylvania, as Secretary
 AVith the organization of this Territory, Governor StSt. Clair's con- nection with the "Wabash and Mississippi country terminated
 William McMillan was chosen to fill the unexpired term of Mr
 Harrison as delegate in Congress, and Paul Fearing for the new term
 These changes required the election of new men to fill the vacancies in the General Assembly
 The most notable one was the appointment of Solomon Sibley, of Detroit, to take the place in the Council of Henry, Vanderburgh, who had been excluded by the division of the Territory
 This occurred in December, 1800
 Since the advent of Moses Cleveland and associates in

 the Territory, Governor StSt. Clair had been somewhat em- barassed in the administration of government in the North- eastern District, as it was known that the jurisdiction of the United States there was regarded with a jealous eye
 The settlers did not recognize the Territorial Government, and, of course, took no part in the affairs of Washington County, in which they had been included by Governor StSt. Clair's proclamation
 They petitioned Congress for relief, and failing there laid a statement of their grievances before the General Assembly of Connecticut, in 1798
 In 1800, on account of losses and delays in their enterprize, due to a lack of civil government, the Land Company asked the State to abate the interest due upon their payments
 1 Hap- pily the difficulty was removed this year by the transfer of the State claim of jurisdiction to the United States, and through the President the fee of the soil by patent to the Governor of the State, for the use of grantees and purchasers, claim- ing under her
2 This district was immediately erected into a county by Governor StSt. Clair, who gave to it the name of Trumbull, and established the county seat at "Warren
 He issued a proclamation for the election of a Territorial Representative
3 Governor StSt. Clair heard of the death of General Wash- ington while he was at Cincinnati in January, 1800
 The loss of this most eminent man and best of friends, affected him deeply, and he withdrew from the public to commune with his own heart
 Let no pen offend the sacredness of that retirement by attempting to describe the grief of StSt. Clair as he recalled the past, and the tender, confiding friendship of the departed hero

 21T was set apart for the purpose of paying the most solemn funeral honors to the memory of the man who was "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his country- men," at the military posts
 StSt. Clair took part in the ceremonies at Fort Washington, which were arranged by the commandant
 Through the influence of the Virginians who had taken possession of the Scioto district, the act which divided the Territory also removed the seat of government from Cin- cinnati to Chillicothe
 Accordingly, the second session of the Territorial General Assembly, which began on the first Monday in November, 1800, was held at that place
 Governor StSt. Clair's address on this occasion, as on that of the opening of the first session, was replete with important suggestions as to legislation for the perfection of the govern- ment, and the general good
 He assured the members of the General Assembly that it would afford him pleasure to join with them in every measure that would benefit the people, and by carrying them faithfully into execution, to give to them the effect desired
 Among the topies mentioned were, education, taxation, justice to the Indians, and the purity of elections, in the discussion of which he displayed the broadest and most enlightened statesmanship
 For the full text of this able state paper the reader is referred to another part of this work
 I refer here only to a sentence or two relating to the Indians and elections, to aid in more clearly bringing into view the character I am portraying: "To act honestly, fairly and justly, and to perform our promises to Indians with whom the nation is at peace," said he, " is as much or more a duty than to those who are in the highest state of civilization, and it is within the sphere of your legislative power to compel it
 It has long been a disgrace to the people of all the States bordering upon the Indians, both as men and as Christians, that while they loudly complained of every injury or wrong received from them, and imperiously demanded satisfaction, they were daily offering to them injustice and wrongs of the most
Page 218

 provoking character, for which I have not heard that any person was ever brought to due justice or punishment
" On elections: "The freedom and purity of elections are the very soul and spirit of representative governments
 If the electors are under any undue influence, though they may give their votes, they do not make their choice; and if they are cor- rupted, the wholesome stream which should flow through the whole body politic is poisoned at its source, and must carry that poison with it through all its ramifications
" The Governor then pointed out in what manner the law for the election of Representatives should be amended to prevent bribery, and alluded to a greater danger which threatened the electors: "The lands in this country have been generally held at first by a few individuals in very large quantities, and sold out by them in parcels on credit
 Hence, it happens that, in some ot the counties, the greatest part of the people are their debtors, and in the existing scarcity of monev were the payment of those debts to be rigorously exacted they would be exceedingly distressed
 A demand of the debts, accompanied by the slightest hints that in case of voting for a certain candidate further time would be given, would have a certain, perhaps, a more certain influence than a direct proposal to buy their votes
 Hence, a few persons in the different counties combining would have it in their power to influence the whole elections in the country, and, instead of a representation of the people, we should have a representation of the great landholders only, who, no doubt, would serve their interests in preference to those of the whole people
 It may, therefore, be not improper lor you to consider whether the mode of election by ballot should not be substituted for that now used, viva voce, as the best way of guarding against that not improbable evil; for, though it be true that the mode by ballot is liable to much deception and intrigue, it is free from that kind of influence I have mentioned
 No measure can of itself be simply good; the circumstances of the case to which it is to be applied determines its propriety

 219 The recommendation of Governor StSt. Clair was not car- ried out until after the change from Territorial to State government
 Having disposed of the public business, the Governor concluded his address with a vigorous reference to his enemies
 "My term of office, and yours, gentlemen of the House of Representatives, will soon expire
 It is, indeed, very uncertain whether I shall ever meet another Assembly in the character I now hold; for, I well know that the vilest calumnies and greatest falsehoods arc insidiously circulated among the people, with a view to prevent it
 While I re- gret the baseness and malevolence of the authors, and well know that the laws have put the means of correction fully in my power, they have nothing to dread from me, but the contempt they justly merit
 The remorse of their own consciences, will one day be punishment sufficient
 Their acts may, however, succeed
 Be that as it may, of this I am certain—that, be my successor who he may, he can never have the interest of the people of this Territory more truly at heart than I have had; nor labor more assiduously for their good than I have done
 I am not conscious that any one act of my administration has been influenced by any other motive than a sincere desire to pro- mote their welfare and happiness
" This was public notice that the Governor was inclined to change his policy, and might no longer pass by in silence those who reviled him
 Heretofore, throughout a long life passed in the public service, his command of tem- per had been exemplary
 He had early schooled himself in the principles so admirably expressed by John Quincy Adams, in 1805, in his Diary: "In public affairs, it ap- pears to me, there ia no quality more useful and im- portant than good humor, because it operates continually to soften the asperities which are continually rising in the collisions of adverse interests and opinions
" But now, when one's enemies, regardless of long public services and white hairs, presume on this forbearance, may not one doubt his own philosophy, and give as well as take blows?
Page 220

 To this personal allusion the Council, in their reply, re- sponded in this sympathetic manner: "It is with real concern and indignation that we view the malicious attempts which have been made to asperse the character of your Excellency; and though the provis- ions of the law might subject the authors to punishment, yet we agree with you, that attempts so despicable and wicked deserve no other notice than contempt
 Believing that your general conduct, as chief magistrate, has been dictated by a pure desire to promote the interests and wel- fare of the people of this Territory, the Legislative Council feel it a duty incumbent upon them, at this time, to express their confidence in your administration, and their wishes for its continuance
" The address of the House of Representatives was hardly less complimentary: "We regret, sir, that calumny and falsehood should be resorted to in order to render your administration unpopu- lar among the good people of this Territory; but, we trust, the services you have rendered heretofore in the cause of liberty and your country, together with the manifest purity of your intentions since you have been entrusted with the dignified office you now fill, will be a sufficient shield to guard you against the unprovoked attacks of the wicked and malevolent
" The unfortunate difference of opinion as to where was lodged the power for the formation of counties, which had been the only one to disturb the harmony of the relations between the Governor and the General Assembly at the first session, again obtruded itself
 He had given his rea- sons for refusing to approve of the counties they had formed, which the reader of to-day will declare to be forcible, and should have been satisfactory then; but they were wot satisfactory to many members of the Legislature
 They insisted that, "after the Governor had laid out the country into counties and townships, as he had already done under the first grade of government, it was competent for them to pass laws, altering, dividing, and multiplying them at their pleasure, to be submitted to him for his approbation;"

 221 that " when the Territory had been divided into counties by the Governor, his exclusive power was exhausted, and any alterations thereafter required, were to be made by the Legislature, with his assent
1" This view was subse- quently sustained by Congress, but as that was in the midst of a political contest, the action had no value in determin- ing which opinion was more nearly in keeping with the letter and spirit of the Ordinance
 The Governor's opinion of the power of the Executive under the clause of the Ordinance relating to this subject, was succinctly stated in a communication to the General Assembly in 1799: "It appears to me that the erecting new counties is the proper business of the Executive
 It is, indeed, provided that the boundaries of counties may be altered by the Legislature, but that is quite a different thing from originally establishing them
 They must exist before they can be altered, and the provision is express that the Governor shall proceed from time to time, as it may become necessary, to lay them out
 While I shall ever most studiously avoid encroaching on any of the rights of the Legislature, you will naturally expect, gentlemen, that I will guard, with equal care, those of the Executive
" There was another reason for his conservatism in this matter, which I have obtained a glimpse of in his papers: The greed which characterized the transactions in land ac- tuated those who were speculators to seek to control the establishment of county towns
 They hoped thereby to in- crease the value of their lands, as the public improvements in the way of buildings and roads, and superior school advantages incidental to a county seat, would attract the better class of settlers to such neighborhoods
 Hence, the hot strife over this business
 A striking illustration was afforded in the case of the county of Adams
 Nathaniel Massie and associates, who, at great hazard of life, had, in 1790, established a station on the north bank of the Ohio, twelve miles above Maysville, sought to have their town, 1 Burned Notes, p

 known as Manchester, made the county seat of Adams county
 In the absence of the Governor, Secretary Sargent, upon the petition of other inhabitants, appointed commissioners, who reported in favor of locating it at Ad- amsville, on Brush Creek
 Great contention grew out of this, and when the Governor returned, he found it neces- sary to take such action as should bring peace to the different communities
 At great personal inconvenience, he visited that section of country, which he examined thoroughly, accompanied by two citizens of Manchester
 It was agreed by these that the most eligible place was at the mouth of Brush Creek, where the town of Washington was laid out, and the first Court was held in 1798
 But this action, intended for the interests of the greatest num- ber, incurred the opposition and enmity of the property owners of Manchester
 And Colonel Nathaniel Massie af- terwards got in his revenge, as the sequel will show
 The Governor was at last aroused, and he refused to be bound hand and foot, as had been proposed by those who had schemed to defeat or delay his re-appointment
 As his term of office expired early in December, advantage was to be taken of the failure to appoint promptly, and Charles Willing Byrd, the Secretary, who was unfriendly to the Governor, was to become acting Governor, and proceed to carry out the views of the junto
 But the Governor re- sponded with a coup d' etat, which completely surprised and discomfited the intriguants
 During the absence of Mr
 Byrd from the Territory, on the 2d of December, he in- formed the General Assembly, by written message, that on Thursday, the 9th of the month, an end must be put to the session of the Legislature, as on that day his term of office would expire, and it was not a case provided for by law, in which the place of the Governor could be supplied by the Secretary
 Of course, this action was criticised, and it occasioned a feeling of disquiet to some of the Governor's best frienda
 However, soon after the Legislature was prorogued, Gover- nor StSt. Clair received his re-appointment from President Adams
 This re-nomination was singular in that the Ex-

 223 ecutive, in recommending the re-appointment, accompanied his message to the Senate with the protests of those in the Territory who opposed StSt. Clair's administration
 The friends of StSt. Clair were a good deal alarmed, hat need- lessly so, as, after a thorough discussion, and the vote was taken, it was found that there were very few opposed to confirmation
 This, pleasing intelligence was communi- cated to him by his friend, Senator Ross
 When the new Legislature, agreeably to the proclama- mation of the Governor, convened, on the 24th November, 1801, the friction between the House and the Executive was increased
 Although the county question was dropped, by mutual consent, yet the Representatives sought a petit re- venge by withholding from the Governor printed copies of the bills as they were introduced
 This provoked a sharp reprimand—well deserved, it must be confessed—which heightened the feeling
 The business transacted this session was of an uniterest- ing character, but none the less important
 The Gover- nor's views, expressed in an address to both brane-hes of the Legislature, assembled in the hall of the House on the first day of the session, were carried out in the legislation ot the session
 He recommended that those citizens who were con- scienciously opposed to Avar be exempt from military duty, and from lines provided for in the militia law—intended to afford relief to the Quakers who were settling in the Ter- itory in considerable numbers; that, as it was important that articles sent to foreign markets should be of the best quality, a law be past for the inspection of articles of ex- port; that the criminal laws be revised; that the delegate in Congress be instructed to obtain such legislation as would secure to the Territory the township of land prom- ised but not furnished by Judge Symmes for the support of an academy, and make available the lands set apart for the maintenance of schools and religion; and that a more re- liable provision be made for a revenue for the support of Government
 Acts were passed during this session to incorporate the towns of Cincinnati, Chillicothe, and Detroit; to establish
Page 224

 & university in the town of Athens, on land granted by Congress for that purpose; and to change the seat of Gov- ernment from Chillicothe to Cincinnati
 An act was also passed declaring the assent of the Ter- ritory to an alteration in the Ordinance for the government thereof, the object of which was to effect a change in the boundaries of the three States fiijBt^prtie formed in the Territory
 This was a political move and caused a flutter among the supporters of a State government
 J!t received an almost unanimous vote in the Council, but in the House there was sharp opposition
 The division was as follows: Ayes—Cutler, Joncaire, Kimberly, Ludlow, McDougall, Miller, Paine, Putnam, Reeder, Schieffelein, Smith and White
—12
 Nays—Darlington, Dunlavy, Langham, McCune, Massie, Milligan, Morrow and AVorthington
—8
 Political excitement was now at fever heat, and personal collisions were threatened daily
 A mob, inspired by the violence of the advocates of a State government, and aided by citizens of Chillicothe, who were offended on account of the proposed removal of the seat of Government, took possession of the town for two nights, and threatened those members of the Legislature who had been most outspoken in opposition to the political views of the State party
 They forced the door of the house in which Mr
 Schieffelein and the Governor boarded, but fled before the former, who met them in the hall with a brace of loaded pistols
1 Governor StSt. Clair sent a special message to the Legislature on the disgraceful proceedings, and wrote to the Secretary of State, giving a circumstantial account of the affair
 The members of the Legislature who had voted against the act providing for a change of boundaries, entered a for- mal protest against it, issued an appeal to the people to aid in obtaining the authority of Congress to erect a State gov- ernment within the bounds assigned in the Ordinance to the first State
 These papers, with others of a confidential nature, were placed in the hands of Thomas Worthington, 1 SiSt. Clair Correspondence

 22S who was dispatched to Philadelphia to secure the much- desired legislation
1 The parties, who had been skirmishing through the press and in pamphlets, were now brought face to face in a deadly struggle
 To enable the reader to understand the situation more clearly, we will go back a few months
 Some of the leading citizens of Marietta had issued a calm address against a change from the Territorial to a State govern- ment, which provoked a whole broadside from the pro-State people
 I find in a number of the Scioto Gazette, October, 1801, the most reasonable statement of that side of the case, and include its points in my sketch
 The writer painted the future in bright colors, but he^et out to catch the populace
 It may be remarked that the Ordinance of 1787 was not held then by the pro-State party in such rev- erence as it is by the people of the North-west in the year 1881: The writer in the Scioto Gazette considered that the Ter- ritorial Government was ill-adapted to "the genius and feelings of Americans;" it only being necessary to direct attention to the Ordinance of Congress for the government of the Territory, to convince one of "the utter impossi- bility of a government conducive to national happiness in this enlightened day being administered under it,' unless by a person more than mortal
' This government, now so oppressive, was prescribed by the United States, at a time when civil liberty was not so well understood as at present, and when it could not be contemplated but for the government of a few
 "It is added by the remonstrants [Marietta], ' that no colony ought to wish to emerge from this State unless there be danger that the paramount government will infringe its rights, till it has made a comfortable provision for its wants, till it has made considerable progress in its improvements, till it has made its necessary arrangements for education, till it has, in some measure, consolidated its social systemj 1 Worthington Papers

 in a word, till it has not only become able to bear the weight of its own independence, but also to preserve its liberty by the force of its principles
' It is then asked, 'Is this our situation? Where are our improvements? What is the state of our agriculture? Our commerce? Our manufactories, etc
, etc
?' To all of which I would answer, that, in my opinion, a state government is the only proba- ble way to produce such a desirable situation
 To talk about our rights being infringed by the paramount govern- ment when we enjoy none, is like'the moral to the fable which concludes the Marietta address, 'it is all sound, no substance
' 
 
 
 We entered into the second grade of this government without a cent in the public treasury and much in debt; recourse was had to paper
 This year's revenue will redeem it all and furnish cash for the present year's ex- penses
 Considerable progress in improvements and neces- sary arrangements for education are making, but can not, in the nature of things, be perfected in our present situa- tion
 It must be well known that men of wealth and in- dependence of sentiment are deterred from migrating to the Territory because they can not brook the idea of living under a government like ours
 But let a change take place—let a government congenial to Americans be adopted, and it will be like opening the floodgates to a mill, wealth will flow in upon us, improvements and agriculture will adorn our lands; the creeks and rivers emptying into the Ohio will roll along to the Mississippi, conveying food to thousands suffering from want; manufactories will spring up in the wilderness; proper arrangements for education will be perfected; a new Athens, with other seminaries of learn- ing, will discover their towering steeples above the lofty oaks, and soon send forth into the world youths ornamental to human nature
 Our prolific plains covered with herds, our farms, loaded from the lap of plenty, gladdening their owner's hearts, and our government, like the tree of lib- erty, extending its benign branches over all our citizens, and, with a paternal care, sheltering and defending them from tyranny and oppression, will cause the astonished

 227 traveler to contemplate our rising greatness with amaze- ment, and cry out, in the language of the venerable Frank- lin, ' Here dwells liberty; here's my country
'" It was shown that the only pecuniary aid received from, the general government was the sum out of which were paid the salaries of the Governor, Secretary, and Judges, some $5,500; and that to pay the officials and miscellaneous expenses of a State government, only about §15,440 per annum, would have to be raised
 To meet this, the Terri- torial tax on real property—fifty-five cents on each hundred acres of first-class, thirty-five cents on second-class, and seventeen cents on third-class—was estimated to yield §27,926
90 for the year 1801
 In the Territorial officers and the able citizens of Marietta, would be found sufficient talent to form a constitution and put in successful opera- tion a new government
 A "Hamilton Farmer" looked upon the scheme for a State government with misgivings
 lie believed it was only to furnish offices for the Chillicothe gentry—the am- bitious and the wealthy at the expense of the poor, and that well enough should be let alone
 There had been the same pother in Kentucky, the same promise of advantages to come
 "But how did it turn out? Why, the gentle- men got the places they were looking for, to be sure, but the people have been kept with their noses to the grind- stone ever since to make up the taxes, and are not able to do it, and now they are coming in shoals every day to this side of the river to avoid them
 But where shall we go to avoid ours, unless we turn Papists and go to the Span- iards, and that would be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire
 God knows we find the taxes heavy enough as we are, and where is the money to come from?" But why expect such plain and practical opinions to pre- vail against the cry that the liberties of the people were endangered by the Territorial government, and that a plan had been formed to perpetuate the Colonial system, with a view of continuing the influence of a few individuals in the •councils of the General Government, and in the manage-

 ment of the Territory?1 The pro-State party had gone in to win
 lu one respect alone, that of the multiplication of officers and a more general participation in public affairs under a State, they had an advantage that more than offset all that could be said ou the other side
 Mr
 Worthington met with few obstacles at "Washington
 There had been a change of
 administration, and the new party was in power under Thomas Jefferson
 The influence of the administration, for reasons that will appear here- after, was with Mr
 Worthington and against a continuance of Territorial government under a change of boundaries
 The provision of the Ordinance requiring a population of sixty thousand before the Eastern District could be admitted as a State was no obstacle to politicians who felt there was a necessity for increasing the number of Republican States
 The census, which was taken during the previous year showed a population of forty-five thousand three hundred and sixty-five
 Could not a State be formed as well with forty-five as with sixty thousand? But in this census were included the inhabitants of "Wayne county, who were opposed to the scheme
 These sturdy Federalists united with those of Washington and Hamilton counties, might make it difficult to give a Republican party-caste to the new State; or might reject the law of Congress, and prevent the formation of a State government
 What should be done? The managers at the National Capital were equal to the emergency—cut off Wayne County
 No sooner said than done
 The act as passed contained two provisions, which the opposition party thought humiliating, and as altering the Ordinance which declared that the States formed from the North-western Territory should be admitted into the Union on equal terms with the original thirteen States
 These were: the reservation of the right of Congress to dispose of the jurisdiction of the Territory lying east of the line drawn east and west through the southerly extreme of lSeeBurnei, p

 229 Lake Michigan, when the Ordinance had declared it should remain a part of the territory south of it until its inhabit- ants numbered sixty thousand; and that lands sold by Con- gress should be exempt from taxation for the term of five years from and after the day of sale
 It was held that a wrong was done to the people living within the district of Wayne, who desired to remain under the government of the country south; and to the people of Ohio, by depriving them of all the benefits they would have derived from the population and wealth of that rich and extensive district
1 And in the second case, that "the people of Ohio suffered an immense loss by giving up that portion of their sovereignty which authorized the State to extend her tax laws to every species of property within her limits, without inquiring to whom it belonged, or by whom it was claimed
"2 The most important fact connected with this whole busi- ness is, that the only organized body representing the people, and the people as a whole, had no part in it
 The scheme for making a new State had a purely political origin
 The contest in the election of the last President was so desperately close, and the result in doubt so long, that it was deemed essential to the future power and control of the Republican party that new electoral votes should be secured by the admission of a new State before the next Presidential election should occur
 This strength could only be obtained from the North-west
 The Republican leaders of that day, who were able, shrewd, and far-seeing, were not likely to overlook a point having such a direct bearing on their cause
 One of the most active promoters of this scheme was John Breckenridge, of Kentucky,3 Mr

 Breckenridge was consulted by Mr
 Jefferson as to the most advisable course to take to counteract the political policy shadowed forth in the Alien and Sedition laws, and he carried with him to Ken- tucky the famous resolutions of 1798, which were adopted by the Legislature of that State
 He is understood to have been the author of the nullifiying resolution of 1799, which took a more advanced step than Mr
 Jefferson in the resolutions of the preceding year

 Worthington is a man of plausible, insinuating address, and of indefatigable activity in the pursuit of his purpose

 They were all on confidential terms with the states- men of Virginia
 Colonel Worthington and Dr
 Tiffin had hardly been in the Territory a year when they formed the design of driving Governor StSt. Clair out and affecting a political revolution
 This will appear more clearly as we progress with our relation

 In order that nothing may be omitted calculated to throw light on this interesting political movement, which embraced in its designs the control of National affairs, I shall quote at some length from manuscripts that have never beeu published, found in part among the papers of Gov- ernor Thomas Worthington
 But first, let us present so much of the contemporary account of Judge Jacob Burnet, who was a leader of the Federalist party, as bears on the relations of Governor StSt. Clair to the polities and the con- tentions of parties in the Territory
 It will be found to be a calm and impartial statement: "The Governor was unquestionably a man of superior talents, of extensive information, and of great uprightness of purpose, as well as suavity of manners
 His general course, though in the main correct, was, in some respects, injurious to his own popularity; but it was the result of an honest exercise of his judgment
 lie not only believed that the power he claimed belonged legitimately to the executive, but was convinced that the manner in which he exercised it was imposed on him as a duty by the Ordi- nance, and was calculated to advance the best interests of the Territory
 It was admitted that he placed too high an estimate on the powers of his own mind, and on the gen- eral correctness of his judgment; and, though modest and unassuming in his ordinary intercourse with society, he very rarely yielded his opinion, when deliberately formed, however erroneous it might be in the estimation of others

Page 232

232 Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair
 "He had beeti accustomed from infancy to mingle in the circles of taste and refinement, and had acquired a polish of manners, and a habitual respect for the feelings of others, which might be cited as a specimen of genuine politeness
 It seemed to be his desire that persons of every grade should feel at ease when in his company
 And it may be said, with great truth, that at the time he addressed the first Territorial Legislature, in 1799, be possessed as great, if imt greater, share of the confidence and respect of the people of the Territory than any other individual residing in it
 "When the proposition to form a
State government was warmly agitated, and party spirit carried to unusual lengths, he expressed himself freely in opposition to the measure; and, although he did not take an active part in the struggle, yet the mere expression of his preference identified him with the party opposed to the change; and not only so, but the influential station he occupied in the community, and the probable result of his communications to Congress on the subject, rendered him an opponent greatly to be feared; hence, the most strenuous efforts were made to weaken his influence, at home and abroad
 To accomplish that purpose, the foibles and faults of a long life were collected, exaggerated, and proclaimed through- out the Territory
 False constructions were put on the most unexceptionable actions of his life
 Ridicule as well as falsehood, was employed against him to puch an extent that strangers to his true character might naturally con- clude that he possessed neither talent nor integrity
 The free use he had made of the veto power, and the collisions which had occasionally taken place between him and the Legislature, though their intercourse had generally been harmonious and agreeable, were urged against him with great effect
 "It was believed by every person who witnessed the change of treatment received by the Governor from the advocates of a State Constitution, before and after the agi- tation of that subject commenced, and who had noted the circumstances attending it, that his opposition to their pro-

 233 ject was the chief ground of their opposition to him; and that, if he had united with them on that question, the dif- ferences of opinion, and the occasional collisions which had occurred during his administration, would have been for- gotten, or remembered only as unimportant errors in judg- ment, not affecting his wisdom, integrity, or patriotism
 Be that as it may, one thing is very certain; that, as the discussion of that project progressed, his supporters were fost deserting him, and, before it closed, a majority of the persons who had been his friends and admirers, were asso- ciated with his most active opponents, and seemed to have forgotten that they had ever believed him to possess a single virtue
 "The efforts made to injure his character, and weaken his influence, were attributed by himself and friends to un- worthy motives
 Some alleged that the hostility of his opponents proceeded from a belief that it was necessary to prostrate him to accomplish their own political views
 But, on a calm review of those party conflicts, after a lapse of more than half a century, many circumstances, over which the mantle of oblivion has been thrown, might be uncovered, which would account for the conduct of the leaders of both parties, without ascribing to them more of self-interest or less of honesty of purpose than falls to the lot of those who were not called consistent politicians
 Some part of the Governor's conduct was condemned by his best friends, and wits well-calculated to excite a warmth of feel- ing in his opponents which might have led upright men be- yond the limits of moderation and even of justice
 "The Governor had many fast friends remaining in the Territory, who received a full share of the abuse in which he participated so largely, and who were not slack in their efforts to sustain him; but the most successful defense of his chactater came from a distant and unexpected quarter
 Mr
 Charles Hammond, a young lawyer of Wheeling, then just admitted to the bar of the Territory—unknown to fame, and scarcely heard of beyond the little circle in which he moved, but whose talents, subsequently, raised him to the highest elevation in his profession, and whose course of

 life identified him with the history and polities of Ohior was induced to commence a series of numbers in the Scioto Gazette, published at Chillicothe, in which he defended the Governor with great ability
 "At the time he engaged in that defense, he had no per- sonal acquaintance with the Governor—had never been in- troduced to him, and knew him only as he did other dis- tinguished men, from his life, public conduct, and writings
 The journals of the day had given him a knowledge of his military services in the French war and in the war of the Revolution, and also of the manner in which the govern- ment of the Territory had been administered; from which he had no doubt of the fact that he was a misrepresented, persecuted man
 The publication of that defense placed his character and conduct in a fair point of light—refuted the most serious charge alleged against him, and elevated the youthful writer to a high stand in public estimation
"1 Judge Burnet did not understand the opposition to the Governor so clearly as he would if he could have looked in upon the Chillicothe committee on political manage- ment when in session, devising ways and means for the overthrow of StSt. Clair
 Even if the latter had acquiesced in the movement for a State government, there could have been no union on political principle
 StSt. Clair, like most other Revolutionary soldiers closely associated with "Wash- ington, came to be an ardent Federalist
 He was in cor- respondence with Hamilton, and on friendly terms with the members of the Adams administration
 We have seen how heartily he approved of the address to the President in 1799
 He even entered the lists in public discussion, and printed a pamphlet in defense of the administration after the political blunder of the Alien and Sedition Laws, and
 sent it to Mr
 Adams, with his compliments
 The latter made a gracious acknowledgment
 "I have read the pamphlet," said he, "with great pleasure, as a masterly refutation of its antagonist, in the style and manner of a gentleman, and seasoned with no more than was useful and agreeable of Attic salt

 235 sentiments countenanced, encouraged, and prevailing in the North-western Territory
"1 Unfortunately, this pamphlet has not been discovered among the StSt. Clair papers
 The political opinions of StSt. Clair were too well known to the junto for them to suppose it possible for him to sup- port their movement
 • On the contrary, they recognized him as the head of the opposition, and aimed all of their blows at him as the political giant to be first dispatched
 All of them had received favors of him, but with Massie and Symmes and Worthington and Finley he had come into sharp contact in the administration of the Territorial Gov- ernment
 The violence of party contentions in the States of Penn- sylvania and New York during this period, with which readers of history are familiar, was equaled by that prevail- ing in the North-western Territory
 On the Fourth of July, 1801, there were two notable celebrations in Hamilton County
 One, held at Columbia, had as presiding officers "William Goforth and Benjamin Stites
 Governor StSt. Clair, who had just returned from a tour to the upper counties, was present by invitation
 The following toast, offered during his temporary absence, was received with applause: "His Exc'y Gov
 StSt. Clair—May his administration be as agreeable to himself as his grey hairs are honorable, and may it be his glory to have been instrumental in meta- morphosing the present anti-revolutional, heterogeneous government of the Territory into that of a free State
" At the other, which was held on the Ohio, above Deer 
 Creek, and presided over by Judge John Cleves Symmes, the toasts were all wildly Republican—extolling Jefferson, Burr, Gallatin, Madison, Clinton and McKean to the skies
 There was no reference to Washington2 or to Adams
 The following toast will show the drift of sentiment: 1 Correspondence of John Adams
 2 This silence was respectful compared with the proceedings at New- ton, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on the Fourth
 John Hanna pre- sided on that occasion, which was devoted to the celebration of the "Glorious trinmph of Republicanism
" The following was among the toasts received with applause: "General George Washington—May the tribute due to his memory now be forgotten

 Glair, "The Press and its Martyr, Duane!—May some angel in Jefferson's form knock off his fetters and unlock his prison
" This spirit entered into political affairs in the Territory, and dominated the movement in behalf of a State govern- ment
 As early as 1800, Worthington threatened to prefer charges against StSt. Clair through the Legislature, but that body was found to be less complacent than was supposed
 James Ross attempted to pour oil on the troubled waters
 In a letter to Colonel Worthiugton he expressed regret at the feeling ag(ainst the Governor, and added this (to Colonel W
) encouraging prediction: "This ferment, and the measures taken in consequence, will result in your having a new State,"l and then proceeded to show it would be a misfor- tune to the people
 When the Territory was divided in the year 1800, the measure originated with these same Chillicothc managers
 The plan embraced the following objects: 1
 The appoint- ment of William Henry Harrison as Governor of the In- diana Territory; 2
 The establishment of the permanent seat of government for the Eastern District at Chillicothe; and, 3
 Such alterations in the form of the Territorial Gov- ernment as should vacate the offices
 It was expected that this would dispose of StSt. Clair, but the scheme met with decided opposition in Congress, especially in the Senate, where it went to a committee and was relieved of its special features
 Colonel Worthington was notified of this ad- verse action by Senator John Brown, of Kentucky, who communicated to him the amendment
 "You will proba- bly object to the provision which has been proposed for continuing all things for the present in the Territory North- west of the Ohio as they now exist
 The Committee of the Senate were of the opinion that to adopt the principle of the bill would vacate all commissions, executive and ju- dicial, civil and military, and also for all elections for the Legislature, and all this to answer a particular object in this in- direct way, which may be otherwise provided for in December

 237 On the 2d May, following, Senator Brown wrote that, as the two houses had disagreed on the bill, " a conference was asked, and, this morning, the managers on the part of the House of Representatives have receded from their dis- agreement, and the amendment of the Senate, heretofore sent you, may he considered as passed
 I congratulate you upon this event, which, in my opinion, will give Chil- licothe the permanent seat of government
"1 The political scheme being only partly successful, the junto next resolved on preventing the re-appointment of Governor StSt. Clair in December
 They sent to the Presi- dent a remonstrance against the re-appointment, backed by an account of the disagreement between the Executive and the Legislature
 Dr
 Tiffin also added personal in- fluence, by appearing in Washington and conferring with prominent members of the Senate
 This did not escape the attention of StSt. Clair, as he was kept advised by Gen- eral Wilkinson, who was at the capital at the time seeking promotion
2 Some of the friends of the Administration suggested the appointment of Mr
 Tracy, of Connecticut, in place of StSt. Clair, but the President adhered to his original purpose of making a re-appointment
 The result has been seen
 Some of the Republicans who voted to confirm the nomination were moved to explain their action to Colonel Worthington :— Senator Brown said: "Under all circumstances we could not well do otherwise
 The applications from the Territory in his favor were numerous and very respectable, nor was it probable, in case of his rejection, that a successor would have been appointed who would have giccn greater satisfaction
"3 General Stevens Thomson Mason thought that StSt. Clair ought not to have been re-appointed, but "some members who did not approve of the appointment were induced to vote for it from an apprehension that, should he be rejected, some person more obnoxious might be ap- 1 MS

 pointed, such as Tracy, and that it would only be exchang- ing an old and feeble tyrant for one more active and wicked
"'1 "I am truly sorry," wrote the venerable General Rufus Putnam to Colonel "Worthington, "I am truly sorry that there ever was or should be a petition presented to the President of the United States, either against or in favor of Governor StSt. Clair
 It serves, in my opinion, no other purpose but to create prej udice and a party spirit among the people
"2 Afterward, when the war on StSt. Clair assumed the most violent phase, General Putnam took an active part in sus- taining the Governor by letter and petition
 Failing in this, there was hope ahead in the change of administration
 If the proper eifort were made StSt. Clair might be removed and the way made clear for a new Re- publican State
 The elder Return Jonathan Meigs, a few months before, had explained the necessities of the politi- cal situation in few words: "They [the Federalists] are apprehensive that if we come into a State government be- fore the next election of President, the present adminis- tration may receive three votes from our then State
" "The Federalists will oppose it [an increase in the number of States], because a multiplication of western or southern States will multiply Republican Senators
" Although Colonel "Worthington had gone to Washington for the ostensible purpose of defeating a change in bound- aries, his real mission was to secure the removal of StSt. Clair and the passage of an enabling act
 The work was pushed with great energy
 It was necessary to create the impression that the people of the Territory lived under a despotism, and that there was no remedy for the evils 1 Hid
 In contrast with General Mason's dreadful view of the char- acter of Mr
 Tracy, it is well to read the opinion of John Quincy Adams, as set down in his Memoirs in 1805: "Mr
 Tracy shows in all his public conduct great experience and a thorough familiarity with the order and course of legislative proceedings
 His manner is pecu- liarly accommodating and conciliatory; b*is command of temper ex- emplary
" But Mr
 Adams was a friend, and not a political opponent, and could not see the devil behind the smiling face

 239 alleged but a radical change of government
 To that end the public mind was inflamed by every art known to the politician; and this, again, was brought to bear upon the administration and Congress
 That staunch 
Republican, Judge Meigs, had no patience with such talk, and never gave it his countenance
 If the Governor's negative could be qualified he thought the Territorial system of government could not be oppressive in any respect
1 "We are, and have been for more than thirteen years under the oppressive hand of tyranny," wildly exclaimed that other Republican leader, John Smith
2 "We want to be free
"3 "Aristo- crats," " Monarchists," were the terms usually applied to the Governor's party
 On the 18th of January, 1802, both Dr
 Tiffin and Col- onel Massie wrote to Colonel Worthington that petitions, numerously signed, had been forwarded to him
 February 1st, Dr
 Tiffin wrote: "I have used evepy exertion to get Colonel Massie to draw up and forward on his charges
 We appointed three different times to meet on that busi- ness
" February 8th, he wrote again on the same subject: "We have this day been busy in drawing up charges to forward to the Secretary of State against Governor StSt. Clair
 Colonel Massie, Mr
 Creighton, and myself, meet again at my house on Wednesday, and we shall send them on by the next mail certainly
 Colonel Massie will enclose the proclamation for erecting the counties of Fairfield, Clermout, and Belmont, agreeable to your request
 McMil- lan is recalled
 He will not, therefore, be seen in Wash- ington this year
 The Governor is expected through here daily on his way
" 3 On the same day Colonel Massie for- warded the proclamations and promised the charges by next mail
 "Suffer me, my dear sir," he added, "to tell you that I am highly gratified with your conduct, and if you can remain a short time longer, will be assisted by all our aid that we can give you

 At last the charges were completed and forwarded under cover of the following note: "Chillicothe, 12th Feb
, 1802
—DEAR SIK :—The enclosed charges I have at length prepared, and have sent them to the Secretary of State, referring him to you for the several documents which you will be pleased to lay before him
 I am in hopes this will arrive in time to be of service
 They, perhaps, will want some explanation that I am sure it will be in your power to give
 "I am, dear sir, "Respectfully yr
 ob't Berv't, "UATH

" 1 It was evident that, at this time, it was not all plain sail- ing
 On the 20th of February, Dr
 Tiffin wrote to Colonel Worthington that he was sorry to hear him express the fear that a law would not puss authorizing a change in the government
 "I have used exertions on this occasion to the utmost of my power
" "I expect, ere this, you have re- ceived the charges against the Governor
 I had much trouble to get Colonel Massie to finish them
" The charges themselves will be found in full in the sec- ond volume of this work
 Let it suffice to remark here that when Governor StSt. Clair obtained a sight of them, he answered them so effectually that President Jefferson refused to take the action asked
 There is reason to be- lieve that Hon
 Wm
 B
 Giles, who was chairman of the Congressional Committee before whom Colonel Worthing- ton presented these charges, and supported them in an ar- gument, advised the President against it
 It is known that Mr
 Jefferson's friendship for StSt. Clair influenced him, and that it was only after it was represented to him some months later upon what seemed to be reliable authority, that Governor StSt. Clair had spoken in public against dem- ocratic government, that he issued the order of removal
 Meanwhile, the efforts for an act authorizing a State Gov- ernment, proved successful in the month of April
 Care was taken, in the act, to exclude the Territorial Legislature 1 MS

 241 from all participation in the work of calling the Conven- tion
 Congress assumed the responsibility for that, and, distrustful of the people, even after severing the citizens of "Wayne county from the Territory, made no provision for submitting the Constitution to the people
 It was still feared by the managers that in some way Governor StSt. Clair would yet defeat the scheme for a State, and renewed efforts were made for his removal
 The feel- ing is plainly expressed in the following letter from Judge Symmes: "WASHINGTON CITY, June 24,1802
 "Dear Sir1:—Here I am yet, puzzling myself with expla- nations of my Miami business with the Attorney General, who sccms willing to hear much and say little, but I have, as yet, no cause of discouragement
 "Governor StSt. Clair is also at Georgetown, but whether it is hope or fear keeps him here so long, I am not able to say
 Some days, I understand, he is in high spirits, and on some other days his mercury stands very low
 "The Attorney General mentioned his case to me the other day, and, of his own accord, told me that he believed there would not be the greatest difficuly in the President's mind, but that some good Republicans had suggested to the President that they thought it would, perhaps, be as well to let Governor StSt. Clair remain in office until our State is formed, and the people choose a Governor for themselves
 My delicacy forbids me to inquire who those good Republi- cans are, but I boldly advised to the contrary; and yet, I suspect those Republicans live in the Territory
 I begin to be afraid that Republicans in the Territory do not agree well on the question of a successor to Mr
 StSt. Clair, and one or more, for fear of not being well pleased with the new, advise a continuance of the old
 I am sorry for it, if it be the case
 We shall have much to dread if Republi- cans do not harmonize like clock-work
 Jealousies ought to be banished from Republicans, or we fail altogether
 I could name an hundred in the Territory that I will assent 1 MS

 to any one out of the number
 When I see you, I will let you know a little more on the subject than I care to write
 "I got a letter from Daniel Symmes, dated the 4th hist
 He tells me the parties are at it pell-mell in Cincinnati, but that the printers there do not give the Republicans a fair chance; print every tIring for Aristocrats, and only now and then a piece for Democrats
 We shall nerrr have fair play while Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table sit at the head, and yet there are Republicans who recommend his continu- ance
 Astonishing!" Summer and autumn passed away, and the convention to form a constitution met, organized, and proceeded to its work, and StSt. Clair was still discharging the functions of Governor
 Men of excellent character and ability had been selected to make a constitution for the new state, more than one fourth of whom were opposed to changing from a Ter- ritorial to a State Government
 On the 3d of November, officers1 having been elected, Governor StSt. Clair proposed to address the convention, and was permitted to do BO
 After the Governor httd made his address, "which was sensible and conciliatory," it was resolved that it was ex- pedient to form a Constitution and State government
3 The presence of Governor StSt. Clair within the bounda- ries of the Eastern District, now about to become a State, was cause of continual disquiet to the Republican leaders
 Their sleep was disturbed with visions of Sir Arthur and his knights continuing at the head, even after the District should come to be the State of Ohio
 Word went up from Cincinnati to Chillicothe that the Federalists intended to rally round him, and make him the first Governor of the State
3 They were filled with despair
 Dr
 Edward Tiffin, who had been promised the first honors by the Republicans, began an active canvass, and in a few weeks wrote, in some confidence, that he thought the situation favorable to their cause

 243 "While the matter was in doubt, StSt. Clair's enemies were watchful, hoping for an opportunity to trip him up
 They lay in wait for him in public and in the social circle
 Two of these l had certified, the preceding December, that in a coversation,ata private house, in Chillicothe, the Governor had spoken contemptuously of the government, and said it "would finally settle down into an Aristocracy, and thence into a Monarchy
" But even this was not sufficient to convince Mr
 Jefferson that a man who had risked his life and spent a large fortune in helping to establish a republic was a monarchist
 Perhaps, he did not care to give official countenance to political warfare of such questionable propriety
 Within a year, however, he took notice of public utterances in antagonism to the principles of the Republican party, or of opinions reported to him to be opposed to his policy, and directed the removal to be made on political grounds

 Dunlevy, of Leba- non, Ohio: "The removal of Governor Arthur StSt. Clair, in 1802, by President Thomas Jefferson, from the Governorship of the North-western Territory: "This removal caused much talk at the time, and Mr
 Jefferson suf- fered not a little abuse for an act which was generally supposed to proceed from mere party proscription
 General StSt. Clair had been appointed by General Washington, was a man of great learning and respectable talent, and, though he pndly failed in his military campaign in the West, General Washington had the fullest confidence in his integrity and civil ability
 Why he was removed by Mr
 Jefferson was, there- fore, never understood, unless it was on simply party prejudice

 Jeffer- son was a Republican—so-called in 1802—and Judge Jacob Burnet, in his valuable ' Notes on the North-western Territory,' has expressed the

 DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, November 22, 1802
 Arthur StSt. Clair, Esq
: SIR:—The President observing, in an address lately de- opinion that the removal of General StSt. Clair was a political partisan movement, wholly uncalled for and unwarrantable
 Whether this removal was or was not justifiable, was a matter on which the people of the North-western Territory then differed, and on which there is, no doubt, still a great difference of opinion
 But whether the removal was right or wrong, the cause of it, and the real actors in it, and the manner in which it was brought about, should be known
 It forms a part of our early history, and with a view of correcting the common error on this point, the facts were communicated to me by the late Governor Jeremiah Morrow shortly before his death
 They are sub- stantially these: "In theiwinter of 1802-3, when the first Constitutional Convention was in session in Chillicothe, there were some warm debates about the point at which the northern line of the State should bo fixed, and quite a disturbance having occurred in the streets of Chillieotho one night, it was attributed by some to this quarrel about the northern boundary
 Under this impression, though it proved wholly erroneous, Governor StSt. Clair called the morning after its occurrence, at the room occupied by two members of the convention from Hamilton county, the late Governor Morrow and Judge Francis Dunlevy, while they were in their room and while the late Judge Luke Foster, also of Hamilton county, was present
 Governor StSt. Clair, referring to this tumult in the streets the night before, and attributing it to the dispute about the northern boundary, proceeded to express his entire want of confidence in our democratic form of government, and declared in the most positive language that v;c must have a stronger government, or anarchy would soon be the consequence
 In giving expression to these sentiments the Governor used terms of the most violent abuse of all democratic in- stitutions
 "The three individuals present on this occasion were all the warm- est advocates of the democratic form of government, and fully believed, while they lived, that, in the progress of Christianity, general educa- tion and consequent civilization, the democratic form of government was destined to supersede all others, and hence they were highly in- dignant at Governor St
 Glair's opinions, and believed him holding these sentiments to be unfit for the Governorship of the vast country included in the North-western Territory, then just beginning to be set- tled
 "Judge Dunlevy, at once reduced Governor StSt. Clair's expressions fo writing
 They were signed by the three persons present, verified by affidavit, and forwarded to President Jefferson
 "At the same time they recommended the appointment, as successor

 245 livered by you to the convention held at Chillioothe, an in- temperance and indecorum of language toward the Legis- lature of the United States, and a disorganizing spirit and tendency of very evil example, and grossly violating the of StSt. Clair, of William Henry Harrison, then delegate of the Territory in Congress, and so well-known since as the distinguished commander of the North-western army in 1812-15, and finally elected President of the United States in 1S40
 Governor StSt. Clair was immediately removed, and General Harrison appointed his successor
 But as Congress, about that time, divided the North-western Territory into districts and sepa- rate Territories, General Harrison was assigned to the Territory of Indiana, and acted as Governor thereof until his appointment as Brigadier-General, in October, 1812, and placed at the head of the North-western army
 "After the death of Judges Dunlevy and Foster, the survivor of the three who had been active in the removal of General StSt. Clair, the late Governor Jeremiah Morrow, called on me, as I understood him, to furnish me with the facts relating to this removal, in order that, after his death, I might explain a transaction that had caused so much ex- citement at the time, and had given rise to a relentless political persecution of a worthy and highly honored patriot
 "If the officers of the Historical Society of Ohio think this matter worthy of their attention, they can use this connnunication as they think proper
 It might be well, in some way, to perpetuate the facts, and thus correct the history of the event
 Judge Burnet, in his work, has devoted a large space to remarks on this removal, and attributed it, as he no doubt really believed, as he interpreted the riotous mob at Chil- licothe, in 1801, to a wanton and unjustifiable persecution of Governor StSt. Clair
 In all this, however, I have been assured he was mistaken

 It would be difficult to crowd into the same space a greater number of errors

 Until recently, the papers which reveal all the facts have not been obtainable, and are made public in this work for the first time
 Mr

 It is cus- tomary to speak of the Ohio Constitutional Convention as having been held in the winter of 1802-3

 This official correspondence is a striking illustration of the political madness of the time
 That a gentleman of the high character, the culture, and the experience of Mr
 Madison could consent to commit such an indignity as to send a letter of removal under cover to a malignant, per- sonal enemy of the officer removed, is remarkable; and it would be difficult to justify the act on the ground of official duty
 It would have been impossible for him to have committed any other act that would have been regarded by StSt. Clair as more offensive
 Thomas Jefferson, Republican, pronounced the address delivered before the constitutional convention intemperate in language, and as exhibiting a "disorganizing spirit
" Jacob Burnet, Federalist, who was present on the occasion, declared it to be "sensible and conciliatory

 ST
 GLAIR'S work in the North-western Territory was finished, and he could look upon it with feelings of pride
 He had helped to secure from the old Continental Con- gress the great charter which secured freedom to a vast empire, and made religion and education fundamental principles in the constitutions of the five republics
 He had given to the Territory a code of laws better in all re- spects than any new country ever had before
 He had seen that Justice tempered her decrees with mercy, and had infused into all the departments of government a spirit of benignity whose influence is still felt, and will continue to be felt as long as these republies exist
 Such services, in the days of the Grecian and Roman world, earned the wreaths of honor and gratitude, and, mayhap, added wealth which insured ease and comfort in old age
 But in the model republic, what? StSt. Clair returned to Pennsylvania, and in time gathered his family about him at Ligonier
 His first efforts were given to the task of putting his private affairs into shape, and if possible securing something to live upon from the wreck of things
 He was now an old man, and unfit to embark in business of any kind, but as he had spent his fortune in the service of the public, he was hopeful that the representatives of the people would remunerate him

 249 for his losses
 Alas
! he knew little of the motives that control men in place
 The past to them is dead, and the services which gray hairs recall may look to that past for their compensation
 They can add nothing to the living present in which ambition is busy building monuments for the future
 The story of StSt. Clair's financial troubles, and his efforts to get justice—aye, even the shadow of justice—from the Government, is a pitiful, and to the Government, a shame- ful one
 I have dwelt on the brilliant services of a long life with pleasure, and now that the evening has come with its shadows, I would hasten to the end
 In the dark days of the Revolution, when it seemed as if Washington's army would melt away and leave him and his officers as the sole force to confront the enemy, he ap- pealed to StSt. Clair to save to him the Pennsylvania line, the flower of that army
 StSt. Clair at once responded by sup- plying from his own private resources the funds necessary to begin the recruiting, which Avas undertaken by Major William Butler
 After the close of the war, he endeav- ored to get this refunded in a settlement of his accounts, but, because of the non-adjustment of other accounts, the Paymaster-General did not allow it, although conceding the regularity of the claim
 It was finally presented to the Committee on Claims in Congress, who reported that the money had been furnished and expended for the benefit of the United States, but that it was barred by the Statute
 In the management of the Indian affairs in the Territory, it became necessary as Superintendent, in order to carry out the instructions of the Secretary of War, to become responsible for supplies which exceeded in amount the warrants furnished by Government, nine thousand dollars
 When StSt. Clair sent his account to the Treasury Depart- ment it was disallowed, because the accompanying vouchers were not receipted
 When this omission was supplied, the contractor required StSt. Clair to give his personal bond for the payment of the vouchers
 When again presented to the Treasury Department for payment, the vouchers could not be paid because there was no appropriation for
Page 250

250 Life and Public Services of Arthur StSt. Clair
 the payment of debts contracted undjer the confederation, and before that could be secured, Mr
 Hamilton went out of office
 StSt. Clair had not been anxious about the matter, as Mr
 Hamilton had promised that it should be attended to, and that interest should be allowed on the claim
 But the new Secretary would do nothing in the matter, and, in 1796, all of the papers were destroyed by fire in the War Office
 StSt. Clair finally applied to Congress, where, again, payment was refused because of the Statute of Limitations! The creditor got a judgment on the bond, and five thou- sand dollars were paid on the debt; but, in 1810, execution was issued, at which time the debt had increased, with in- terest, to ten thousand dollars
 At that unfavorable mo- ment, when the embargo had driven money out of the country, St
 Glair's property was forced to sale
; and a most valuable tract of land, on which there was a good mill, a large and well finished dwelling-house, and all of the necessary outhouses for a farm, and a furnace for smelting iron, on which StSt. Clair had laid out about ten thousand dollars (which was so valuable that at the time it was rented for twenty-four hundred dollars per annum)— all of this property, in value over fifty thousand dollars— a large sum in those days—which would have made him and his family comfortable for the remaining years of his life, was sacrificed to pay a debt which was in no proper sense personal, but was due from the United States
 It went under the hammer for four thousand dollars! All of his other property went in the same way, and StSt. Clair, wife, daughters, and orphan grandchildren were reduced to poverty
 
 This home, from which they were now driven, was built while StSt. Clair was Governor of tbe North-western Terri- tory—about 1799—and was named by him "The Hermit- age," in fond anticipation of the time when he should be relieved of the cares of State
 It was about two miles north of Ligonier, on a tract of land received by StSt. Clair at the close of the Revolutionary War
 Alexander John- ston says the residence was considered handsome at the time
 It was handsomely painted and papered, and, besides ordi-

 251 nary apartments, had a suite of numbered rooms
 The situation was picturesque, a fine trout stream flowing in front of the house through an expanse of meadow and woodland, with the blue outlines of the mountains visible in the distance, to complete the landscape
 Nothing re- mained of the old mansion, when last seen, except StSt. Clair's own room, which was as he left it, but the painting over the fire-place had been destroyed
 In referring, afterwards, to the executions which swept away this beautiful home, and all his personal property, StSt. Clair said: "They left me a few books of my classical library," (including Horace, one would hope,) "and the bust of Paul Jones, which he sent me from Europe, for which I was very grateful
" "Was not this forbearance which spared the counterfeit of an old friend, and the means for forgetting the pangs of hunger and the ingratitude of man sufficient to be grateful for? This was more than the Government did: it took the best years of its subject's life, piled debt upon debt, and' then mocked his gray hairs
 If, as Schiller truly says, it is the most important concern of every State that justice should prevail, and all men in the world should have their own, how shall we describe the magnitude of the crime that drove, empty-handed, from the door of the Capitol, where Justice, it is supposed, ever has her seat, the man who gave his all to his country? One is reluctant to believe that party feeling had any- thing to do with this refusal to pay the just claim of a cred- itor, and, yet, the debates show that the members entertained a feeling of political animosity that is inconceivable at the present
 Even as late as the winter of 1818, when the era of" good feeling" yet prevailed, and an effort was made to pay the principal of the debt due to StSt. Clair, there was great acrimony displayed in the debates
1 Then the gallant 1 In further illustration of the bitterness of feeling entertained by Republican politicians against the old Federalist, I give here the fol- lowing extract from the proceedings of the House, Feb
 5, 1818: "Mr
 Mercer then moved the following amendment, by way of pre- amble: 'Whereas, the Congress of the United States entertain a high sense of the tried integrity, as well as of the civil and military virtues,

 old patriot did not lack eloquent orators to plead his cause —his cause? the cause of honesty and right embraced in the duty of government—for there were Henry Clay, of Kentucky; Charles F
 Mercer, of Virginia, and William Hcury Harrison, of Ohio, who stood forth in his behalf
 But the debt was not paid—never was
1 Finally, there was wrung from that Congress a pension of sixty dollars per month, but not a dollar of it ever reached StSt. Clair, for a creditor seized upon it at the very door of the Treasury
 The sacrifice of his home drove StSt. Clair to the barren lands of Chestnut Ridge, (about five miles west of Ligo- nier,) where the few remaining years of his life were spent in great privation
* His favorite daughter, Mrs
 Louisa Robb, shared his fortunes and cheered his remaining days
 The dwelling was a log house, situated by the side of the old State road that passed from Bedford to Pittsburgh
 Hither many were attracted by the fame of the noble resi- dent, whose dignity of carriage, fire of spirit, and charm of conversation were preserved in spite of his extreme aze

 The biographer of General Lewis Cass, referring to that statesman's acquaintance with StSt. Clair, described him as he was when contending with political opponents at the beginning of the century: "General StSt. Clair was a most interesting relic of the of Arthur StSt. Clair, late President of the Congress, and Commander- in-Chief of the Army of the United States, whom they learn, with regret, has been reduced, by misfortune, to extreme poverty
'" This motion was negatived—ayes, 01; noes, 81
—Annuls of Congress
 Pennsylvania, after StSt. Clair was reduced in circumstances, settled an annuity of three hundred dollars, and, in 1817, increased the amount to six hundred
 1 In 1857—thirty-nine years after the death of StSt. Clair—Congress appropriated a considerable sum for the benefit of his surviving heirs
 2 During the last four years of his life, the family were frequently in great want
 Some patriotic ladies of New York, hearing of StSt. Clair's necessities, sent him
 a remittance in money, and afterwards eight hundred dollars in steamboat stock, which, however, proved to be worthless
 Nevertheless, the deed was a good one, and StSt. Clair ac- knowledged it in a graceful letter

" "Lewis Cass saw him for the last time some years before his death, in a rude cabin, supported by selling supplies to the wagoners who traveled the road, one of the most striking instances of the mutations which chequer life
" Hon
 Elisha Whittlesey saw him in 1815, as he and three friends were journeying from Ohio to Connecticut on horse- back
 "I proposed that we stop at his house and spend the night
 He had no grain for our horses, and after spending an hour with him in the most agreeable and in- teresting conversation respecting bis early knowledge of the North-western Territory, we took our leave of him with the deepest regret
 "I never was in the presence of a man that caused me to feel the same degree of esteem and veneration
 He wore a citizen's dress of black of the Revolution; his hair clubbed and powdered
 When we entered, he rose with dignity, and received us most courteously
 His dwelling was a common double log-bouse of the Western country, that a neighborhood would roll up in an afternoon
 Chest- nut Ridge was bleak and barren
 There lived the friend and coiu'idant of Washington, the ex-Governor of the fairest portion of creation
 It was in the neighborhood, if not in view, of a large estate near Ligonier that he owned at the commencement of the Revolution, and which, as I have at all times understood, was sacrificed to promote ihe success of the Revolution
 Poverty did not cause him to lose bis self respect, and, were he now living, his personal appearance would command universal admiration
" The journey is nearly ended
 On one of the closing days of August, 1818, the venerable patriot, in his eighty- fourth year, undertook to go to Youngstown, three miles distant, for flour and other necessaries
 Ho bade good-bye to his Louisa and started off with his pony and wagon, in good spirits
 Tho authorities had changed the State road so that it passed along the Loyalhanna Creek, several miles

 Pony and wagon moved safely along until within a mile of the vilhigc, when a wheel falling into a rut, the watron was upset, and the aged Gen- eral thrown with great force upon th
e rocky road
 In the course of the day he was discovered lying where he had fallen, insensible, and the pony standing quietly at a short distance, awaiting the command of his old master—faithful to the last
 lie was carried tenderly hack to the house, hut neither medical skill nor the tender care of loved ones could restore him, and, on the thirty-first, Death came with his blessed message of peace forevermore
 On a neat sand-stone monument, erected by the Masonic Society, in the cemetery of Grcensbnrg, is this inscription: THE EARTHLY REMAINS OF MAJOR-GENERAL ARTHUR STSt. Clair ARE DEPOSITED BENEATH THIS HUMBLE MONUMENT, WHICH is ERECTED TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF A NOBLER ONE DUE FROM His COUNTRY

 Ever noble shall appear the names of the few faithful companions and friends of Washington
 What one deserves to stand above that of StSt. Clair? His abilities, his genius, his unselfishness, and his loyalty en- titled him to share in the councils of his Chief

 "Dear Sir:—Your letter was laid aside and overlooked
 I have no other letters of StSt. Clair's than those you allude to
 I have, however, an incident connected with the General, which I will give you: Thomas Leiper, of Philadelphia, a member of the City Troop which served under Washington during the campaign of 1770, stated to my father, CV
iiender Irvine, that StSt. Clair had not received the credit he deserved—of having suggested to General Washington the crossing the Delaware into New Jersey, which resulted so favorably to the Amer- ican cause, and to General Washington's fame
 Mr
 Leiper said, the fact that StSt. Clair did suggest the movement was well known in camp
 Leiper was a man of high honor and veracity, and would not have stated the fact if not true
 At the same time he related the circum- stances, ho was commiserating StSt. Clair's misfortunes
 It, is not an uncommon thing for the Commander-in-Chief to reap all the laurels of his subordinates
 True, he assumes all the responsibility of any particular course of action
 General Washington, as a military man, had not, I think a suggestive mind, but he had the good sense to know when to follow sound advice

* I no sooner Returned Home from Court3 than I Found papers containing the Resolves, as they Called them, of ye 1The writer of this letter — George Wilson, generally known West of the mountains, at that date, as Colonel Wilson — was one of the justices of Bed- ford county, Pennsylvania, '• nominated and authorized by the Governor, for the time being, by a commission under the broad seal of the Province
" He was not a man "learned in the law," but was, nevertheless, a prominent and influential citizen
 He was afterward, upon the erection of Westmoreland county, appointed one of its trustees for the purpose of "fixing a place for building a Court-House [and] a Goal [jail] for the said county
" He was, alsn, made one of its justices of the peace, having received his first appoint- ment February 27, 1773, and a second one the llth of January, 1774
 Col- onel Wilson, at one time, resided at Staunton, Virginia, and moved thence to Pennsylvania
 He succeeded JIackay as Colonel of the Eighth Pennsyl- vania Regiment
 Died at Quibbletown, New Jersey, in the spring of 1777
 2The "intestin Broyls" referred to are the boundary troubles between Pennsylvania and Virginia, the history and progress of which will hereafter more fully be shown

 He was frequently west of the mountains
 Ho •was a native of the State in which he lived
 The use of his name (though wrongfully) in the celebrated " appeal " of Logan, the Mingo chief, has made it familiar to every school-boy
 2George Croghan (pronounced Crohon) was a native of Ireland
 He first settled upon the Susquchanna, where as early as 1746, ho was engaged in the Indian trade
 He afterward was agent for Pennsylvania among the In- dians upon the Ohio and tributaries
 He erected a fort at the site of the present Shirleysburg, Huntingdon county Pennsylvania
 Early in the French AVar, he was a captain; but, in 1750, he threw up his commission, and repaired to Sir William Johnson, who appointed him a deputy Indian agent of the Pennsylvania and Ohio Indians
 After Pontiac's War, he lived at his settlement upon the east side of the Alleghany river, four miles above Pittsburgh, where, as Sir William's deputy, ho continued very effi- cient

 201 numbers in a very doubtful situation, and will probably make it very difficult to carry the laws into execution; I wisb it may not end in a regulating scheme like what was lately in Carolina, certain it will be impossible to collect the taxes in some parts of that coun- try
 You will see by Col
 Wilson's Letter1 that he has been active in suppressing a commotion in his neighborhood, and I hope you will be so good to represent it to the Council * in its proper light
 There have lately been two Indians murdered near Fort Pitt ;3 the person who committed it is now in our jail but denies the fact— but he had owned it to several which with other circumstances I hope will be sufficient to convict him
 The Judges I doubt will not be very fond of coming here to try him
 I had the fellow sent to Fort Pitt and confined there a few days, that the Indians might see him and know that we were willing to do them justice, and went up myself to his examination before them; they seemed to be pleased with it, but it is hard to tell what they really think
 I am very glad to hear of Mr
 Perm's 4 safe arrival in England in so short a time, and hope to hear soon of the Governor's arrival here

 at Fort Stanwix (Rome, in the State of New York), in 1788, " long ago got a deed for lands from us, which may now be taken into Mr

 Notwithstanding this, Mr
 Croghan was, at the writing of this letter, "making out patents to such persons as will buy of him
" These facts, with Cresup's report that Pennsylvania '• did not extend beyond the Alleghany Mountain," made it difficult, as the sequel shows, "to carry the laws into execution," as StSt. Clair quaintly expresses it

 Its members resided in Maryland and Virginia, with an associate in London—fourteen persons in all
 Its object was the settling of wild hmds west of the Alleghany moun- tains, and trade with the Indians
 Its members obtained a grant of livu hundred thousand acres of land from the Crown, to be chiefly taken on the south side of the Ohio River, between the Monongahelaand Kanawha
 The Revolution put an end to the existence of the company
 2 In August, 176:5, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, of London, Eng- land, were selected by Lord Baltimore and the Penns to complete the boun- dary line between the provinces of Maryland and Pennsylvania
 They were both eminent suryeyors
 The line they run (which extended further westward than the northwest corner of Maryland) has received their names —Mason and Dixon's line; figuratively, the dividing line between the northern an 1 southern States of the Union
 The work of Mason and Dixon began late in the year 1763, and ended in October, 1767
 3 Mr
 Croghun means by the words, "beyond ye End of Maryland," to the westward of the north-west corner of Maryland
 4 That is, the running of the boundary line beyond the northwest corner of Maryland was not done by authority to determine any thing as between Pennsylvama and Virginia
 This pomt by Mr
 Croghan was, certainly, well taken, as Virginia took no part in the running of the line
 As the '-back line " between Maryland and Virginia had not been determined, it was to the interest of the former province that Mason and Dixon should continue west beyond the mountains, for the reason that just how far westward her territory extended had not been settled
 Her " back line" was, at that period, a sub- ject of controversy between the provinces, depending upon the question of the location of the "first fountain of the Potomac;" as the line was defined to be a meridian, extending from that point to the southern boundary line of Pennsylvania
 The province of Virginia claimed all the territory west of the head of the south branch, while Maryland insisted that her territory extended as far west as the head of the north branch

 FORT PITT, July 10th, 1772
 Dear Sir:—I think it will be best to delay doing any thing about the lot we were talking of, till I have the pleasure of seeing you again
 Two days ago I was informed of the determined resolution of a considerable number of people in the Redstone settlement,3 to oppose the jurisdiction of your court in that part of the country, till the western bounds of Pennsylvania are run, and I apprehend the measure will be productive of bad consequences, tho' it may be the means of having that boundary sooner established than it other- wise would be
 It does not become me to speak freely of this mat- ter, but you know my sentiments respecting the western bounds of Pennsylvania, and I do assure you that no part of this deep laid scheme was communicated to me till within these two days past, and I hope you will believe that I have not been instrumental in promoting an af- fair, which, if carried into execution, will be productive of many bad consequences
 If you hear me censured by any worthy persons, on the score of friendship, I request you will declare my sentiments, but don't shew this letter, as you know how I am circumstanced
 I shall be glad to hear from you

 265 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH SHIPPEN, JR
 BEDFORD, July 18th, 1772
 Sir:—A day or two ago a petition in the name of the people liv- ing to the westward of the Laurel Hill, signed by two hundred and twenty persons, was presented to our court
 It charged the Gov- ernment and the officers of the court with great oppression and injustice; and prayed that directions might be given to the sher- iffs to serve no more process in that country, as they apprehended it was not in Pennsylvania
 You will remember that I formerly acquainted you that asso- ciations were forming to oppose the jurisdiction of the Province
 I then thought they would have died away, but they appear now to be coming to such a
 head as threatens very dangerous conse- quences; something more than the settlement of the western boundarv is certainly aimed at, tho' that is the pretense held forth to draw in the people
 I wish it may not be a design to throw the whole Province into confusion, and may not turn out a second Car- olina affair
 Col
 Cresap appears openly to be a prime mover in this matter, as you will see by the inclosed copy of his seditious letter, for- warded to me by Col
 Wilson, and Mr
 Croghan is strongly sus- pected of giving it much encouragement privately
 Our sheriff lately informed me he had seen a letter of his to the people about Red Stone, reflecting much on the Government, full of scurrility against all the officers, and advising them to treat sheriffs or con- stables in such maunor as the worst of men would deserve
 I took the liberty to write to him about it, and remonstrated freely on the consequences of such conduct
 I inclose his answer to me,1 he denies indeed the advising any act of violence, but in such a man- ner as seems to say acts of violence would be justifiable, and it is certain that specious kind of stuff with which it is filled, is daily dealt out to the people in great abundance, by the emissary of a party, the members of which I don't know
 A gentleman who is unfortunately connected with them writes me from Fort Pitt, the llth inst
, thus: "It does not become me to speak freely of this matter, but you know my sentiments re- specting the western bounds of Pennsylvania, and I do assure you that no part of this deep laid scheme was communicated to me till within these two days past, and I hope you will believe that I have 1See Croghan's letter to StSt. Clair, June 4, 1772, ante

 The petition was presented by Mr
 Brent, a gentleman from Maryland, who practices in our county
 He oflered nothing in sup- port of it, but the uncertainty where Pennsylvania ends, and the hardship it was on people to live under authority that was perhaps usurped
 He was answered by Mr
 Wilson, and I assure you the Proprietaries and the people are very much obliged to him
 In a very handsome si>eech of about an hour he opened the Constitution of the Province, compared it with that of the neighboring Colo-' uies, and pointed out where it excelled them
 He explained to the people the conduct of the Proprietaries in granting their lands; their great indulgence to settlers; their singular lenity to their tenants, and the peculiar mildness of the whole system of their Government, and concluded with showing to them how fatal to themselves the granting their request must prove
 I think it was lucky it was spoken so publicly, as many people from the doubt- ful part of the country were present, and seemed so pleased with the conduct of the court in rejecting the petition
 If l might trouble you with a conjecture, I would say some peo- ple in Philadelphia are at the bottom of all these disturbances
 A certain ambitious set who would not scruple to wade to power thro' the blood of their fellow citizens, have still a change of Gov- ernment in view ; by theirennssaries,ti>cy may embroil the Province, whilst at the same time, by their influence on a certain party in Assembly, the hands of Government may be so weakened, that order can not soon be restored, but this is all conjecture, and I am no politician; but certain I am messengers and expresses pass and repass betwixt Philadelphia and Fort Pitt too frequently for any pri- vate transaction to bear the expense
 It were to be wished that the boundary was fixed and so all pre- tense taken away; but if there are no orders to that purpose, per- haps it might answer a good end to divide this county and fix the county town at Fort Pitt
 I believe it is beyond a doubt the Province will extend beyond it, and the people would perhaps think in this manner that the Proprietaries would not take that step with- out being absolutely certain

 We have a bill found for burglary which will oblige the judges to come up, or give you the trouble of forwarding a new commission

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH SIHPPEJT, JR
 [No DATE
] l Sir:—Since I last wrote to you I have made a little excursion into the country of our rioters, and find that the moderation of our court has very much disappointed them
 It seems the design of the petition I mentioned in my last was, to have provoked the court to have committed the attorney, and some of the petitioners who were present, which was to have served as declaration of war, a considerable number having engaged immediately to proceed to Bedford, break the jail, and set them at liberty
 Luckily, fear or shame got the better of the worthy attorney, (who is a grandson by marriage of old Cressap,) and the privileges of the Province were so clearly pointed out by Mr
 Wilson, that I trust it has had a good effect, a great many people having since paid their taxes that had before refused; however, there is still a number of people, abetted chiefly by Mr
 Croghan, that refuse to submit to the jurisdiction of this Province, and very lately the sheriff has been very ill treated by a number of them; about twelve waylaid him, and came upon him and one of his deputies stark naked, and threatened to put them both to immediate death, but after much abuse they consented to let them go that time, but swore in the most dreadful manner, that if they ever returned to attempt to serve process, they would sacri- fice them or follow them to their own houses and put them to the most cruel death
 The sheriff knew several of them, particularly Abraham Tee Garden and William Tee Garden, the Younger, who 1Although this letter is without dnte, the context shows it to have been written shortly after the one to Shippen, of July 18, 1772—the last one given

 are the ringleaders of this gang of villains, John Death, Andrew Gndgell and Michnl Cock; they were all well armed with guns, tomahawks, pistols and clubs; and the sheriff is of opinion that only for a pocket pistol which he produced he would certainly have met with extreme ill usage if he hud escaped with his life
 I have said these people are chiefly abetted by Mr
 Croghan, and I think I have reason to say so; for no longer ago than Friday last, the collector and constable whom he had called to his assistance to levy (Mr
 Croghan's) his taxes, were drove off by his people, and that Mr
 Croghau
 himself threatened to put any or all of them to dcath if thev attempted to touch any of his effects, for that he was not within the Province by thirty miles
 This will be handed you by William Lochry,1 Esqr
, a magistrate of this county, and treasurer
 You will find him an intelligent man, and can give vou any further information about matters in this part of the country
 I suppose he will be desirous to wait upon the Governor; I will be obliged to you if you will please to intro- duce him; however, he is a plain, honest man, and allowances must be made for his address
 I intend soon to have the pleasure of seeing you, and am, etc

 It is entirely in consideration of the duty I owed myself, and the friendship I always possessed for you (friendship that did not con- sist in professions only, and wanted power, not will, to make it truly serviceable) that I deal thus candidly with you; Thomp- son,1 having spoke to me, has resolved not to oppose him, and I am (and have always been) resolved not to appear on the opposite side you would be on; therefore if you offer yourself for assembly- 1 William Lochry; was afterward, upon the erection of Westmoreland, commissioned a justice of the peace for that county

 Dear Sir:—Your esteemed favor dated Philada

 Every body up this way are well satisfied there is a county granted on this side of the hills,2 altho' I find every body else as well as myself, observes with infinite concern, that the point in question is not attended with so favor- able circumstance as we at this place had reason to expect, from the nature of things
 I can not but express my surprise at the point determined in favor of the courts of law first sitting at Hanna's
" Pray may I ask you the question, Where is the conveniency for transacting business on these occasions, as there is neither houses, tables, nor chairs? Certainly the people must sit at the roots of trees and stumps and in case of rain the lawyers' books and papers must be exposed to the weather, yet to no purpose, as they can not presume to write
 Consequently, nothing can be done but that of revising fees, by which means every body (the lawyers, only, ex- 1 John Proctor was elected sheriff of Bedford county for 1771-2; James Piper lor 1773-5

 cepted) going to or attending court, must be sufferers
 No doubt but Mr
 Irwinl and a few more of his party, may find their interest in this glaring stretch of partiality, yet we, at this place, in particular, are too much interested to look over such proceeding in silence
 The whole inhabitants exclaim against the steps already taken to the injury of the county yet in its infancy, and that too, before it got its eyes or tongue to speak for itself
 My dear friend, if I had as much to say among the great as you, I would declare it as my opinion that it would be absolutely neces- sary that the commissioners2 should be nominated in Philada
, by which means I think we could not fail to have the point in question carried in our favor; whereas, should they be appointed up this way, it is ten to one, if Joe Irwin and his associates will not prevail
 I am sorry for our disappointment in our hopes of being indulged with a small garrison at this place, but in failure of that, nothing could afford me greater satisfaction than the prospect of having you, my friend, my neighbor at this place
 This I will look for now every day, and if you will send me word when you will set of from Ligouier I will meet you half way and perhaps a Divine and another friend to show you the way up here
 As to Ross, he seldom speaks as he thinks—for my part I therefore pay but little regard to his declarations
 The people of this place take great umbrage at the very thoughts of being disappointed of the county town's not taking place here at once, and are, to a man, willing to come to any measure or charges, in order, if possible to frustrate the intrigues carried on by a certain party
 I think we can not exert ourselves too much on this occa- sion, and therefore would be very glad to receive your opinion of the affair and your advice in regard to the most intelligible steps to be pursued in the first setting off
 I would be exceeding glad how soon other affairs could admit of your coming up here, by which means a plan might be concerted, that in my opinion could scarcely fail of succeeding to our wish
 I daily inquire after the welfare of your family, and have the pleasure of informing you that Mrs
 StSt. Clair and the children are well and in good health

 Dear Sir:—I received your favor of the 12th ulto
 by Mr
 Devx
 Smith,1 inclosing a letter from Mr
 Mackay; since which the Gov- ernor has been out of town, and I have not as yet had an oppor- tunity of acquainting him with the necessity there appears for another magistrate at Pittsburgh, and with your recommendation of Mr
 I)
 Smith;l but I shall take the first proper occasion of doing it
 We have just received news by the June packet that Mr
 JohnPenn is reappointed to the Government of this Province, which will occasion the postponing of that and other business, except com- mon matters, of course, until the new Governor's arrival, as he is expected so soon as the latter end of this month
 He is to embark at Plymouth the 2oth of June, or 1st of July at fartherest, in a large India ship for New York
 A few days after the date of my letter to you of the 15th May came to hand your recommendation as Clerk of the Peace
 The fees on the commission you paid, when you received your other Commissions
 The land I mentioned to you in my last letter adjoins and lies below lands of Mathew Rogers; but I shall defer thoughts of disposing of it for the reasons you give me
 The reports you mention about blank warrants are alwolutely false, and the person who first propagated the story by pretending he was possessed of a number of them, has confessed before witnesses that he never had any, either with the Governor's name or his seal; tho' he had made some few ignorant people be- lieve so, by producing to them blank copies, such as the Surveyor General fills up and directs to the deputies

 This impudent piece will, I am much afraid, be the means of creating great confusion and disturbance in this county, unless proper steps will be taken to check it in time
 The Doctor informs us that Lord Dunmore 3 has made applica- tion to General Haldiman for a serjeant and twelve men, to be sent immediately to this place, in order to support his authority
4 The captain has already appointed six or seven magistrates, among whom are Major Smallman," John Campbell,6 and John Gibson ;7 1 John Conolly, a native of Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, was bred a physician; hence, his usual title of Doctor
 He was a nephew of George Croatian, and, according to the testimony of George Washington, "a very sensible, intelligent man
" He had traveled over a great deal of the coun- try watered by the Ohio and its tributaries, and was well known west of the mountains
 It may be here premised that he was selected by the Gov- ernor of Virginia to maintain possession of Fort Pitt, as well as Pittsburgh and its dependencies, for that Colony, and to put the militia an'd other Vir- ginia laws in force there, as against those of Pennsylvania
 2The Advertisement was as follows: "Whereas, his Excellency John, Earl of Dunmore, Governor-in-Chief and Captain General of the Colony and Dominion of Virginia, and Vice Admiral of the same, has been pleased to nominate and appoint me Captain, Commandant of the Militia of Pitts- burgh and its Dependencies, with Instructions to assure His Majesty's Sub- jects settled on the Western Waters, that having the greatest Regard to their Prosperity and Interest, and convinced from their repeated Memorials of the grievances of which they complain, that he purposes moving to the House of Burgesses the Necessity of erecting a new County, to include Pittsburgh, for the redress of your Complaints, and to take every other Step that may tend to afford you that Justice for which you Sollicit
 In order to facilitate this desirable Circumstance, I hereby require and command all Per- sons in the Dependency of Pittsburg, to assemble themselves there as a Militia on the 25th Instant, at which Time I shall communicate other Mat- ters for the promotion of public Utility

 Should it so happen that Mr
 Hoofnagle1 can not return in time, but which he will do if it be possible, what occurs to me is previous to the day appointed for the Assembly 2 to demand such security of Mr
 Conolly for his good behavior as he will not be able to pro- cure, and in consequence to have him committed; to direct the sher- iff3 to have a sufficient number of such as can be depended upon, to protect the jail, should a rescue be attempted, which perhaps may be the case, and to write to the magistrates,4 some to attend at the jail, and some at Pittsburgh
 I have written to Mr
 Wilson- for his counsel on this thought, and to know if there is any other legal way of securing Mr
 Conolly, and to desire he would suggest any other method to preserve the i>cace of the county, which will certainly be greatly endangered
 I need not press you to dispatch Mr
 Hoofnagle; the shortness of the time is too evident; suffer me, however, to hint that this ser- vice is foreign to his engagements with me

 LIUONIER, January 15, 1774
 Sir:—This will be delivered by Mr
 Hauna, one of the trustees for Westmoreland county
5 To some management of his I believe, the opposition to fixing the county town at Pittsburgh is chiefly owing—it is his interest it should continue where the law has fixed the courts, pro tempore; he lives there; used to keep public house 80th
 He remained in office until after the commencement of the Revolu- tion
 1Michael Huffnagle was, subsequently, judge of the Common Pleas of Westmoreland county, and held several other offices
 He was somewhat of a distinguished character west of the mountains during the Revolution

 Envin, another trustee, adjoins, and is also public house keeper
 A third trustee1 lives in the neighborhood, which always make a majority for continuing the courts at the pres- ent place
 A passage in the law for erecting the county is, that the courts shall be held in the foregoing place (the house of Robert Hanua) till a court house and jail are built; this puts it in their power to continue there as long as they please—for a little manage- ment might prevent a court house and jail being built this twenty years
 This is explanation of a petition to the House, which was sent down lately; it was begun and ended on the Friday of the court week
 An unexpected opportunity to Philadelphia offered that day, by reason of which it is to the House only, and signed but by a few people, but the few that have signed it are the princi- pal people; and who acted more from their feelings for multitudes, whom they saw suffering than from their own inconvenience
 A like petition to the Governor will soon be forwarded, which will be countenanced, by, I am certain, five-sixths of the whole people

 GOVERNOR PENN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, 20th January, 1774
 Sir:—I am extremely obliged to you for your great attention to the interest of this Government in transmitting, with so much dis- patch and care, the intelligence contained in your letter of the 12th of this month, to Mr
 Secretary Shippen, and the papers it in- closed
 I can not help being greatly surprised to find that Dr
 Conolly hath published an advertisement, asserting his apiwintment by Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, to act as Captain Command, ant of the Militia of Pittsburgh, and its dependencies; and that in consequence of such appointment, he had taken upon him to as- semble the people as n militia, under the Government of Virginia, and to appoint magistrates of Pittsburgh
 As his Lordship must certainly know that the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania hath been exercised at Fort Pitt, and in the neigh- borhood of it, for several years past, and hath not given me the least intimation of any design to extend his Government there, I am much inclined to conclnde that Mr
 Conolly hath, on this oc- casion, assumed powers which Lord Dunmore never gave him
 However, I shall, without loss of time, dispatch a messenger to Williamsburg, with a letter to his Lordship,1 in order to obtain an explanation of this very strange affair
 In the mean time I would, by all means, have you and the other magistrates of your county assert the right of Pennsylvania, and protect the people in every part within its known limits, as Fort Pitt5 most certainly is
 The meeting of a number of people under arms, in consequence of Mr
 Conolly's summons, will undoubtedly be an act of a crimi- nal nature, for which they may be indicted and punished, and comes properly under the idea of an unlawful assembly, with an intention to disturb the public peace; you will, therefore, do right in apprehending him and some of his principal partisans, after such meeting, and holding them to reasonable security for their appear- ance at the next sessions, to answer for their conduct
 I expect the magistrates on this occasion, will do their duty with 1 See the letter following—Penn to Dunmore, dated January 31, 1774

 277 Spirit, in which they will be supported by the Government; and if any of Conolly's pretended magistrates shall presume to proceed ju- dicially within the known limits of the Province of Pennsylvania, I desire that proper actions may be commenced by the party ag- grieved, not only against the officer who executes the process, but the magistrate also under whose authority he shall act; and you may be assured that such actions shall be prosecuted and supported at the expense of this Government
 In order to strengthen the hands of the magistracy on this oc- casion, in the course of their duty, I send you a copy of the riot Act made by the present Assembly, which has received my assent, and will pass the seals before this comes to your hands, and ex- tends to all parts of the Province
 But, as the execution of it may be attended with the most serious consequences, the proceedings un- der it should be conducted with the utmost caution, and great care must be taken to extend it only in such places as are certainly within the limits of the Province, of which you can make the best judgment of any body, by the share you had in running a line to ascertain the situation of Fort Pitt
1 I have made an addition to the Bench of your county, and send the commission for the new magistrates by this opportunity
2 I would have you get possession, if you can, of some of Conolly's original advertisements
 GOVERNOR PENN TO LORD DUNMORE
 PHILADELPHIA, Slut January 1774
 My Lord:—A few days ago I received by express, from the west- ern frontiers of this Province, the inclosed copy of an advertise- ment, lately set up at Pittsburgh and divers other places in that quarter of the country, by one John Conolly, who has taken upon him as Captain Commandant of the militia at Pittsburgh, and its de- pendencies, by virtue of your Lordship's commission as he savs, to command the people to meet him there as a militia on the 25th in- stant, and to exercise jurisdiction over them, as settlers under your Government within the Dominion of Virginia
 1Concerning thy efforts put forth previous to this date to determine the southern and western limits of south-western Pennsylvania, mention is hereafter made
 • 2 The additional magistrates commissioned were, Van Sweariuffen, Thomas Scott, Alexander Ross, John Carnnghan, Andrew McFarlanc, Oliver Miller, Devereux Smith, and John Shepherd

278 The StSt. Clair Papers
 A step so sudden and unexpected could not but be matter of great surprise to me, as well as very alarming to the inhabitants of those parts, who have taken up, improved, and hitherto peace- ably enjoyed their lands under grants from the Proprietaries of this Province
 Being, however, too well acquainted with your Lordship's char- acter to admit the least idea that you would countenance a measure injurious to the rights of the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania cir which might have a tendency to raise disturbances within their Province, I flatter myself that the laying before you a short state- ment of the limits of this Province, so far as regards the present question and acquainting you with the steps which have been taken to ascertain its western extent, and the situation of Pittsburgh, will be abundantly sufficient to satisfy you that that place is, beyond all doubt, within this Province
 The western extent of the Province of Pennsylvania, by the Royal Grant, is five degrees of longitude from the river Dela- ware, which is its eastern Ixmndary
 In the year 1768, an east and west line was run from Dela- ware, at the mouth of Cristiaua Creek, to the crossing of Dunkard Creek, a branch of the Monongahela, by Messieurs
 Dixon and Mason, two surveyors of distinction, who were sent over from England to run the division line between Maryland and Pennsyl- vania
 These artists fixed the latitude and extent of that line with the utmost exactness and precision, to the satisfaction of the Commissioners on both sides
1 From the 233d mile stone on this line, a north line hath been since carefully run and measured to the Ohio, and from thence up to Fort Pitt;' the several courses of the river have been taken with all possible care
 From the line of Dixon and Mason to a known point in the south line of the City of Philadelphia,the true course and distance hath been discovered by 1The exact distance run by ilason and Dixon from the Delaware Rivcr was 244 miles
 38 chains, and 36 links
 Thls took them across the Monon- gahela to the second crossing of Dunkard Creek, a little west of what is now Mount Morris, in Greene county, Pennsylvania
 At this point, they struck •' the Warrior branch of the old Catawba war path;
" that is, the eastern edgo of lands claimed by the Six Nations, when their labors were given up
 The extreme western limit of the line run by them was about twenty-one and one-half miles east of the south-west corner of Pennsylvania, as established in 1784, by astronomical observations
 2 It was in the running of these temporary lines that StSt. Clair took part, as mentioned by Governor Penn, in his letter of the 20th of January,

 Rittenhouse, and our Surveyor General, in order to ascertain the difference of longi- tude between Delaware and Pittsburgh, who all agree that the latter is near six miles eastward of the western extent of the Province
 The better to illustrate this matter, and enable your Lordship to form a jndgment of the accuracv with which the work has been douc, and the caleulations made, I have inclosed a map or draught of the several lines above mentioned, with explanatory notes, as delivered by them to me
 Should your Lordship, however, con- trary to my expectation, still entertain any doubt respecting this matter, I hope you will at least think it reasonable for avoiding those mischiefs which must naturally arise in eases of clashing and disputed jurisdiction, to defer the appointing of officers, and ex- ercising government in that neighborhood, and suffer the people to remain in the quiet and undisputed possession of the lands they hold under this Province, till some temporary line of jurisdiction can be agreed on by commissioners, to be appointed by both Gov- ernments, to confer on this subject, or until the affiiir can be settled by His Majesty in Council, before whom a petition, exhibited bv the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania, for the settlement of their west- ern as well as other boundaries is now depending
 I shall hope to recieve your Lordship's sentiments of this matter by the first opportunity
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, February 2, 1774
 I am honored with your letter of the 20th January, which reached me the 28th, and am happy to find the method pursued at Pittsburgh, on the 25th, did not very materially differ from that vou had been pleased to direct
 Doctor Conolly was arrested previous to the meeting, by my or- ders, on his avowing himself the author of the advertisements re- quiring the people to meet as a militia, and committed on refusing to find sureties for his good behavior till next court
 I was in hopes the sending him out of the way1 would have put 1 Conolly was taken to Hannustown where there was a sort of jail and there confined

 an end to it altogether; but I was mistaken
 About eighty per- sons in arms assembled themselves, chiefly from Mr
 Croghan's neighborhood, and the country west of and below the Monongahela, and, after parading through the town, and making a kind of fen de joie, proceeded to the Fort,1 where A cask of rum was produced on the parade, and the head knocked out
 This was a very effectual way of recruiting
 As a scene of drunkenness and confusion was likely to ensue, I got the magistrates (who attended in consequence of the letters I had ;:ent them) together, and read the inclosed pa- per,2 which we had concocted that morning, and, at the conclusion, 1 Fort Pitt
 2 The paper referred to was as follows: "As friends und fellow countrymen, which we ought all to consider each other, from whatever different quarters of the globe wo have met here, suf- fer that wo muke you acquainted with some things of which you ought not to be ignorant
 "We do not blame you for having an affection for the laws of the coun- tries and provinces in which you have been born; 'tis a natural, 'tis a praise- worthy affection! And it requires a length of time and diligent application to discover and give the deserved preference to different systems of laws and forms of Government, for which but few have either leisure or oppor- tunity
 "We do not tell you the plan of Pennsylvania is a perfect one
 Such, no human institution is or ever was; but the rapid progress Pennsylvania has made, the numbers of people that flock to it from every part of the world, and particularly the much greater value of landed property than in the ad- joining parts of the neighboring countries, evince that it is no very defec- tive one; evince that its laws are mild and salutary, and that property and liberty, civil and religious, is well secured, and that it has some advantages over its neighbors
 "We doubt not but you will readily acknowledge these matters: but you will reply, it is nothing to us; the soil we live on being no part of Penn- sylvania; we can have no part of the advantages or disadvantages arising from its constitution
 "Wo well know much pains have
 been taken to persuade many of you to a belief of this, and likewise that the Proprietaries have industriously de- layed to settle their boundary
 There is net the least foundation for either
 "The Proprietaries of Pennsylvania claimed the country about Pittsburgh, and the settlers quietly acquiesced in that claim; and as soon as doubts be- gan to arise about it they took effectual pains to satisfy themselves whether or not they were right in that claim, and actually found the country a con- siderable distance west of that place within their Province: And so fur are they from delaying the running their boundary line, we have the best au- thority for saying that a petition has been a considerable time before his Majesty for that very purpose
 You must be sensible it would be to little

 281 when they were required to disperse, they replied they had been in- vited there, but came with peaceable intentions, and would go home again, without molesting any one; on which we left them; how- ever, towards night, their peaceable disposition forsook them, and I should probably have felt their resentment, had I not got intimation purpose to run it without the concurrence of the Crown; certainly it would never be conclusive
 "The jurisdiction of Pennsylvania baa been regularly extended to Pitts- burgh, and exercised there for a number of years, as the records of Cum- berland, Bedford, and Westmoreland counties testify; and you yourselves have acknowledged it, by applying for your lands in that Province
 "Whether that extcntion has been legally made or not, can be determined by the Crown alone; but must be submitted to till it is determined
 And it must be evi- dent to you that Lord Dunmore, as Governor of Virginia, can have no more right to determine this matter than one of us, for this plain reason: the charters of Pennsylvania and Virginia, both flowed originally from the Crown; on that footing they are perfectly independent ot each other; but they are both parties in this dispute, and consequently neither can be judge
 "We would fondly hope no person in this country would wish to be from under the protection of law
 A state of anarchy and confusion, and total subversion of property must inevitably ensue
 We can not help thinking contending jurisdictions in one and the same country must produce similar effects, and every attempt to introduce modes or regulations not warranted by the laws or constitution of Pennsylvania will also do so in a certain degree
 "Any grievances the inhabitants of this part of the country suffer, there is no doubt the Legislature want only to be informed of to redress
 Should it bo imagined the protection of a military force is necessary, the votes and proceedings of the last winter session of Assembly will shew that, probably, it was owing to the representions of the Indian Agent, that an Indian war would certainly follow, establishing a military force at Pittsburgh, that such protection was not then granted, and time seems to have shewn he was not in the wrong
 "If that effect would have supervened at a time when his Majesty's troops were just withdrawn, when the country was naked, defenseless, and alarmed, and when the Indians were accustomed to the idea of troops in their neighborhood, much more is it to be doubted the establishing a militia, which is a military force, will produce that effect now when they have been BO long disused to it
 "As his Majesty's Justices and Protectors of the public peace of Penn- sylvania, it is our duty to tell you your meeting is an unlawful one, and that it tends to disquiet the minds of his 
Majesty's liege subjects
 We do in his Majesty's name require you to disperse, and retire yourselves peace- ably to your respective habitations

 of their design
 I thought it most prudent to keep out of their way
1 I have no doubt the magistrates will do their duty with spirit, and I shall take the earliest opportunity to make them acquainted with the support your Honor is determined to afford them
 In some parts of the country they will have a difficult task, and I am really afraid this affair will be productive of a great deal of confu- sion
 I shall not fail to give them the necessary caution with regard to the Riot Act, and I think I can judge pretty nearly how far it may be safely extended
 Mr
 Conolly has most certainly a commission from Lord Dun- more, expressly for Pittsburgh and its dependencies, and his subalt- erns are John Stephenson, a brother of Mr
 Crawford, our Senior magistrate,2 William Harrison, a son-in-law of his,3 and Dorsey Pen- ticost, who was lately in the commission of the peace here

 Penticost has, I hear, been down to Mr

 Mr
 McKee1 is said to be ap- pointed a justice by Lord Dunmore, but I would fain hope without his consent; at any rate he behaved very well on the late occasion, and, as he was doubted, I made a point of having him there under pretense of his being Indian Agent, but in fact, if he was a friend or abettor of Conolly's measures
 It is, sir, extremely grateful to me that my conduct in any part meets with your approbation; but should I forget to be attentive to any thing that may disturb the happiness of your Government, or from which you may receive a personal injury, I should be guilty of the grossest breach of duty, as well as the blackest ingrati- tude, neither of which, I trust, will ever be the case
 WILLIAM SMITH2 TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PIULAD'A, Feb'y 8th, 1774
 Dear Sir:—About the breaking up of the Assembly, Capt
 Thom- son went to the Governor and got the promise of Mr
 McCrea's dis- trict to be added to his own
 Mr
 Woods hearing of this, got his friends to represent to the Governor, that he had the first promise from Mr
 Lukens
 Mr
 Shippen and I likewise told the Governor that you had the first promise during Richard Penn's administra- tion, and the Governor then declared that if you had the first prom- ise, no one else should have it, for that there was no person he would sooner oblige than you
 But, on the whole, as these matters were before he came in as Governor the last time, he left Mr
 Lukens to declare who was the first applier to him, and to act accordingly
 He therefore certified to the Governor that Mr
 Woods was the first ap- plier and he has got the district, and I undertook to make you easy about the matter, which I was the more willing to do, as I believe the district is now of very little value; and I know of something which you may have, of six times the value, tho' I dare not trust 1Alexander AIcKee was a native of Pennsylvania and early became a trader among the Indians, carrying on a large business from Pittsburgh in conjunction with Alexander Ross, from 1768 to 1772, when he became Sir William Johnson's Deputy Indian Agent, resident at that place

 You must not think that because this was suffered to go to Mr

 I shall be glad to hear how matters go at Fort
 JOSEPH SPEAR TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PITTSBURGH, February 23, 1774
 Dear Sir:—I am just now informed that the Virginians up the Monongahela have had two or three musters lately; one at Red Stone Old Fort, and one yesterday at Paul Freman's, on the other side of the Monongahela; and I am also told they had a meeting at Mr
 Peuticost's own house, in consequence of which Mr
 Peutieost wrote to Mr
 Swearingen to act no longer there as a Peunsylvanian magistrate at his peril
 I therefore think it would be advisable to endeavor to have a stop put to those proceedings, if possible, as it creates the greatest disturbance, and very much retards the execu- tion of our civil process

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH SHIPPEX, JR
 LIGONIER, February 25, 1774
 Dear Sir:—The disturbances that have begun in this country seem still to be increasing, and, unless some effectual method is soon fallen upon to put a stop to them, will soon come to a formidable head
 What that method should be it is difficult to say, but possi- bly the running a temporary line might quiet the people a little though I doubt very much if even that would not now be opposed
 As much the greatest part of the inhabitants near the line have removed from Virginia, they are inexpressibly fond of any thing that comes from that quarter, and their minds are never suffered to be at rest
 Mr
 Croghan's emissaries (and it is astonishing how 1After Conolly was committed to jail at Hannastown, the sheriff let him go at largo on his giving his word of honor to return to next Court
 Ha did return, but in a manner quite different from that expected by the sheriff,

 285 many he has either duped or seduced to embrace his measures) are continually irritating them against Pennsylvania, and assuring them they are"not within its limits; so that unless Lord Dunmore does formally recede from what he has undertaken in this country, it will be next to impossible to exercise the civil authority
 From the very beginning I foretold a second Carolina affair was intended, I am now convinced of it
 I have letters from all the magistrates in that part of the country, complaining of the difficulties they are exposed to, and the open and avowed determination of the people not to submit to their jurisdic- tions
 However, they are all still as yet, and I will do what in my power lies to continue them so; as one step towards it, and to con- vince the others that we in some measure are in earnest, I intend immediately removing my office to Pittsburgh, adjoining, there to live the moment I can get my farm off my hands here
 I enclose you a letter from Mr
 Spear,1 which I received by the bearer
 I shall immediately write to Mr
 Swearingeu to commit, •without ceremony, any person who shall attempt to oppose or molest him in the execution of his office

 LORD DUNMORE TO GOVERNOR PENN
 WILLIAMSBURG, 3d March, 1774
 Sir:—I have been favored with your letter of the 31st January, 1774, and duplicate of the same, the occasion of which having been the appointment of certain officers by me in a remote district of the county of Augusta,2 in this Colony, which includes Pittsburgh, which having been done, as is always my rule, with the advice of his Maj- esty's Council, I could not, till I had an opportunity of laying your letter before them, return you an answer, and it is not till now that I am enabled so to do
 From the opinion, therefore, of his Majesty's Council of this 1 See the previous letter—Spear to StSt. Clair, February 23, 1774
 *The county of Augusta was, at this date, an old one, but ever of very uncertain western limits
 The "remote district," spoken of by Lord Dun- more, was what was usually known as the "District of West Augusta," in- cluding, besides, much other territory in what is now the State of West Virginia, all the present State of Pennsylvania lying upon the waters of the Monongahela, as well as the country surrounding Pittsburgh

Page 286

286 The St
 Glair Papers
 Colony, I must inform you, that although the calculations on which you rely in the plan accompanying your letter, may possibly be found exact, yet they can by no means be considered, by us, as the observation, on which they were founded, was made without the participation of the Government, or the assistance of any person on the part of the Crown; and even if they were admitted, we ap- prehend they would" decide nothing in the present case; for the right of the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania to the country about Pittsburgh, must be founded on better authority than is there adduced to make it valid, and we are strengthened in this opinion by the principles you yourself adopt, and the opinion of Lord Camden, which you have produced in your dispute with Connecticut
 With respect to the right of this Colony to that country, the transactions of the late war show sufficiently what was ever the sense of the Government of Virginia with regard to it
 And it seems to me that the step which I have taken ought not to have been either unexpected or surpris- ing, as you are pleased to say it was to you, when it is well known that formal declarations were made by the Assembly of Pennsyl- vania, that Pittsburg was not within the jurisdiction of that Gov- vernment at the time that requisitions were made to them for the de- fense of that place, the burden of which, on that account, fell on this Government
 In conformity to these sentiments you will easily see I can not possibly, in compliance with your request, either revoke the com- missions and appointments already made, or defer the opportunity of such other officers as I may find necessary for the good govern- ment of that part of the country, which we can not but consider to be within the dominion of Virginia, until his Majesty shall declare the contrary; and I flatter myself I can rely so far on the prudence and discretion of the officers whom I have appointed, that the measure which I have pursued may have no tendency to raise dis- turbances in your Province, as you seem to apprehend, and if any should ensue I can not but believe they will be occasioned, on the contrary, by the violent proceedings of your officers; in which opin- ion I am justified by what has already taken place in the irregular commitment of Mr
 John Conolly for acting under my authority, which, however, as I must suppose, it was entirely without your participation, I conclude he is before this time released
 But, nevertheless, the act having been of so outrageous a nature, and of a tendency so detrimental to both Colonies, that, with the advice of his Majesty's Council of this dominion, I do insist upon the most ample reparation being made for so great an insult on the authority of his Majesty's Government of Virginia; and no less can possibly
Page 287

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 287 be admitted than the dismission of the clerk (StSt. Clair) of West- moreland county, who had the andacity, without any authority, to commit a magistrate in the legal discharge of his trust, unless he (StSt. Clair) can prevail, by proper submission, on Mr
 Conolly, to demand his pardon of me
 GOVERNOR PENN TO LORD DUNMORE
 PHILADELPHIA, Slat March, 1774
 My Lord:—I was favored with yours of the third of this month by express, which arrived when several of the gentlemen of the Council were out of town, and it being also my rule to consult the Council upon all occasions of a public nature, I could not possibly give your Lordship's letter an answer by the return of your mes- senger, who stayed but a very short time in town
 I am sorry the papers I enclosed you had not the desired effect
 I never expected they would be taken as decisive of the boundaries of Pennsylvania, as conclusive upon your Government, but I had reason to hope they contained such information as would show at least a very strong probability that Pittsburgh, the place of dispute, was within this Province, and not subject to the Government of Virginia, and from them I conclnded you would be convinced of the impropriety of a step which I conceived must have been taken upon a supposition that that place was certainly bevond our limits
 But I perceive your Lordship hath taken upon opinion that it is not material whether it be within our charter Ixmnds or not, and that the right of the proprietors of Pennsylvania to the country about Pittsburgh must be founded on better authority than the Royal grant! And as your Lordship seems to imagine yourself supported in this sentiment by our own principles in Lord Camden's opinion upon our ease with Connecticut, the transactions of the late war, and the declarations of our Assembly some time ago, I will take the liberty of endeavoring t« set you right in some matters which you do not seem to be fully informed of, being persuaded that if I can be so happy as to place tbem in a different point of light from what you have heretofore viewed them in, you will be candid enough to change your senti- ments
 In the year 1752, the Proprietors of Pennsylvania understanding that the Government of Virginia were about to erect forts upon the Ohio, in order to repel the encroachments of the French on the properties of the subjects of his Britannic Majesty, they instructed their then Governor, Mr
 Hamilton, to assist in any measures of
Page 288

288 The KtSt. Clair Papers
 that sort, taking an acknowledgment from the Governor of Virginia that such settlement should not be made use of to prejndice their right to that country, and at the same time allowed him to give as- surances that the people should enjoy their lands they bona fide set- tled on the common quit rent
 Of this instruction Mr
 Hamilton not long after gave notice to Governor Dinwiddie
 In the vear 1754, Mr
 Dinwiddie came to a resolution of raising men and building forts to the westward, in order to repel the in- vasions of the French
 He had fixed upon the forks of Monon- gahela as a proper situation for one of these forts, supposing it to be on his Majestv's lands, and issued a proclamation, expressing his purpose of erecting a fort at that place, and inviting the people to enlist in his Majesty's service against the French; and as an en- couragement, promising that the quantity of two hundred thousand acres of land should be laid out and divided amongst the adventurers, •when the service should be at an end; one hundred thousand acres of which to be laid out adjoining the fort, and the other one hundred thousand acres on the Ohio
 Upon the appearance of this proclamation Mr
 Hamilton wrote to Governor Dinwiddie, the 13th March, 1754, reminding him of his former intimation respecting these lands, and enclosing an abstract of the Proprietaries' instructions, and also requesting from him such an acknowledgment as the Proprietaries expected; to which Mr
 Dinwiddie, in his letter of the 21st March, 1754, answers: "Your "private letter of the 13th current, I have duly received, and am "much misled by our Surveyors if the forks of Monongahela he "within the limits of your Proprietaries' grant
 I have for some "time wrote home to have the line run, to have the boundaries "properly known, that I may be able to appoint Magistrates on the "Ohio, (if in this Government) to keep the traders and others in "good order, and I presume soon there will be Commissioners ap- pointed for that service
 lu the mean time, that no hindrance "may be given to our intended expedition, it is highly reasonable, "if these lands are in your Proprietaries'grant, that the settlers "should pay the quit rent to Mr
 Penn, and not to his Majesty; "and, therefore, as much as lies in my power, I agree thereto, after "the time granted by my proclamation, to be clear of quit rent, "ceases
" From this correspondence between the Governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania, it appears beyond a doubt, that the terms upon which forts were built, and settlements made in that country, by the Gov- ernment of Virginia, were well understood, and the rights of Penn-
Page 289

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 289 sylvania carefully guarded; and these transactions entirely exclude the idea of that kind of settlement, or acquiescence and agreement of which Lord Camden speaks, and which are the only principles in his opinion from which your Lordship can draw any conclusions in favor of the right of Virginia
 From this view of the matter I flatter myself your Lordship will readily perceive that the principles of Lord Camden's opinion do not all apply to the present case
 As to the opinion of our Assem- blies, on which you seem also to rely, the case is shortly as follows: When Governor Dinwiddie resolved to erect forts on the waters of the Ohio, and to carry an expedition against the French, who had fortified themselves in several parts of the country to the westward, he applied to Governor Hamilton to procure him the assistance of this Province
 Unfortunately at this time there was no very good understanding between the Government and the Assembly, and when Mr
 Hamilton laid Mr
 Dinwiddie's requisition before them they declined complying with it, and urged for reasons, that, by the Royal orders to the several Governors, they were not to act as prin- cipals out of their own Governments
 That they (the Assembly) would not presume to determine upon the limits of the Province; and that by the papers and evidences sent down to them, and re- ferred to by the Governor, the limits of the Province had not been clearly ascertained to their satisfaction
 It is to be observed, that at this time there had been no real men- surations from Delaware to the westward, except the temporary line between this Province and Maryland, which extends only one hun- dred and forty-four miles from Delaware
 From this line, and from sundry informations of Indian traders, founded on computed dis- tances, and mountainous and crooked roads, Mr
 Hamilton con- cluded that the French forts were considerably within this Province, and it hath since appeared with certainty that the fact was so, though the Assembly were not satisfied with those proofs
 And it appears by a report of a Committee of Assembly, appointed to examine those evidences, that they laid no great stress upon the opinions of traders founded on computed distances
 Upon the whole I can not find that the Assembly ever made any thing like formal declarations " that Pittsburg was not within this Government," but that they rather declined making any determina- tion upon the extent of the Province
 But if their declarations had been ever so formal or positive, I can not conceive how any proceed- ings of theirs would affect the state of the Province, control of the jurisdiction, or prejudice the rights of the proprietors

290 The StSt. Clair Papers
 Your Lordship is pleased to say: "With respect to the right of this Colony to that country, the transactions of the late war suffi- ciently show what was ever the sense of the Government of Vir- ginia with regard to it
" I do not know to what particular trans- actions you allnde, nor can I apprehend upon what principle the sense of the Government of Virginia can prejndice the right of Pennsylvania, especially when the Governor of this Province was so far from concurring in any such sense, that he took the most effectual measures to guard against any conclusions which might be drawn from it; and I may say, with the strictest truth, that the Govern- ment of Virginia, with great justice, concurred in this precaution
 Upon the whole, then, my Lord, I hope the papers I heretofore had the honor of sending you, when properly attended to, will sat- isfy you that Pittsburgh is at least probably within the charter lim- its of this Province: and I natter myself that what I have now urged will be sufficient to convince you that nothing can be inferred from the transactions of the late war, the correspondence between the Governors of the two Provinces, the proceedings of our As- sembly, or the principles of Lord Camden's opinion, to contract the extent of our charter bounds, or establish the right of Virginia to any part of this Province
 I therefore still hope that your Lord- ship will, upon a review of the subject, be induced to defer attempting to extend the jurisdiction of Virginia within the bounds of this Province, and thereby avoid the occasions of disturbances and dis- sentions amongst his Majesty's subjects, which will probably ensue from such a step, however prndent and cautious the Magistrates on each side may be inclined to be, and the rather as a petition for a commission to run out and mark the boundaries between us is now depending before his Majesty
 And to prevent the setting up claims, and making conclusions of right by the Government of Virginia, from the circumstances of settlement on the one side, and non-claim on the other, I must take this opportunity of notifying to your Lordship that the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania do claim, by their said petition, as part of their Province of Pennsylvania, all the lands lying west of a south line, to be drawn from Dixon and Mason's line, as it is commonly called, at the westernmost part of the Province of Maryland to the beginning of the fortieth degree of north lati- tnde, to the extent of five degrees of longitnde from the river Del- aware; and I must request your Lordship will neither grant lands, nor exercise the Government of Virginia within those limits, till his Majesty's pleasure be known
 I am truly concerned that you should think the commitment of
Page 291

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 291 Mr
 Conolly so great an insult on the authority of the Government of Virginia, as nothing less than Mr
 StSt. Clair's dismission from his offices can repair
 The lands in the neighborhood of Pittsburgh were surveyed for the Proprietaries of Pennsylvania early in the year 1769, and a very rapid settlement under this Government soon took place, and magistrates were appointed by this Government to act there in the beginning of 1771, who have ever since administered justice without any interposition of the Government of Virginia till the present affair
 It therefore could not foil of being both sur- prising and alarming that Mr
 Conolly should appear to act on that stage under a commission from Virginia, before any intimation of claim or right was ever notified to this Government
 The adver- tisement of Mr
 Conolly had a strong tendency to raise disturbances, and occasion a breach of the public peace, in a part of the country where the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania hath been exercised without objection, and therefore Mr
 StSt. Clair thought himself bound, as a good Magistrate, to take a legal notice of Mr
 Conolly
 Mr
 StSt. Clair is a gentleman who for a long time had the honor of serving his Majesty in the regulars with reputation, and in every station of life has preserved the character of a very honest worthy man; and though perhaps I should not, without first expostulating with you on this subject, have directed him to take that step, yet you must excuse my not complying with your Lordship's requisition of stripping him, on this occasion, of his offices and livelihood, which you will allow me to think not only unreasonable, but somewhat dictatorial
 I should be extremely concerned that any misunderstanding should take place between this Government and that of Virginia
 I shall carefully avoid every occasion of it, and shall always be ready to join you in the proper measures to prevent so disagreeable an in- cident, yet I can not prevail on myself to acceed in the manner you require, to a claim which I esteem, and which I think must appear to every body else to be altogether groundless
 WILLIAM CRAWFORD1 TO GOVERNOR PENN
 WESTMORELAND COUXTY, April Sth, 1774
 Sir:—As some very extraordinary occurrences have lately hap- pened in this county, it is necessary to write an account of them to 1 Crawford, at this date, was President of the Court in Westmoreland
 He was the first to hold that office
 During the year of 1770, he was pn-

 you
 That which I now give, is at the request and with the appro- bation of all the magistrates that are at present attending the court
 A few weeks ago Mr
 Connolly1 went to Stanton and was sworn in as a justice of the peace for Augusta county, in which it is pre- tended that the country about Pittsburgh is included
 He had, be- fore this, brought with him, from Williamsburg, commissions of the peace for several gentlemen in his part of the Province, but none of them, I believe, have been accepted
 A number of new militia officers have been lately appointed by Lord Dunmore; several mus- ters of the militia have been held, and much confusion has been occasioned by them
2 I am informed that the militia is composed of men without char- acter and without fortune, and who would be equally averse to the regular administration of justice under the Colony of Virginia as they are to that under the Province of Pennsylvania
 The disturb- ances which they have produced at Pittsburgh have been contin- ually alarming to the inhabitants
 Mr
 Connolly is constantly sur- rounded with a body of armed men
 He boasts the countenance of the Governor of Virginia, and forcibly obstructs the execution of legal process, whether from the court or from single magistrates
 A deputy sheriff has come from Augusta county, and I am told has writs in his hands against Captain StSt. Clair and the sheriff, for the arrest and confinement of Mr
 Connolly
 The sheriff was last week arrested at Pittsburgh for serving a writ on one of the inhabitants there, but was, after some time, dis- charged
 On Monday last, one of Connolly's people grossly in- sulted Mr
 Mackay, and was confined by him in order to be sent to jail; the rest of the party hearing of it, immediately came to Mr
 Mackay's house and proceeded to the most violent outrages
 Mrs
 pointed one of the magistrates for the county of Cumberland, within the limits of which was his homo, as claimed by Pennsylvania
 Upon the erec- tion of Bedford the next year out of a portion of Cumberland, his commis- sion was renewed tor that county; finally, when Westmoreland, in 1773, was erected into a county from Bedford, h'is office was continued; and, being thu first named, he became by courtesy and usage presiding judge of its courts

 Hence the lack of uniformity in that respect
 2 The visit of Conolly to Staunton was made after the sheriff of West- moreland county had given him his liberty upon his word of honor to re- turn to Hannastown at the next sitting of the court, which was to take place early in April
 He returned to Pittsburgh towards the latter part of March, and prepared to make good his word to Sheriff Proctor
 It will now be seen in what way he kept his promise

 293 Mackay was wounded in the arm with a cutlass; the magistrates and those who came to their assistance, were treated with much abuse, and the prisoner was rescued
 Some days before the meeting of the court, a report was spread that the militia officers at the head of their several companies would come to Hanna's, use the court ill, and interrupt the administration of justice
 On Wednesday, while the court was adjourned, they came to the court-house and paraded before it; sentinels were placed at the door, and Mr
 Connolly went into the house
 One of the magistrates was hindered, by the militia, from going into it till per- mission was first obtained from their commander
 Mr
 Connolly sent a message to the magistrates, informing them that he wanted to communicate something to them, and would wait on them for that purpose
 They received him in a private room
 He read to them the in- closed paper,1 together with a copy of a letter to you, which Lord Dunmore had transmitted to him,2 inclosed in a letter to himself, which was written in the same angry and undignified style
 The magistrates gave the inclosed answer3 to what he read; and he 1 The paper read by Conol ly to the Westmoreland Court was in these words: "Gentlemen: I am come here to be the occasion of no disturbances, but to prevent them
 As I am countenanced by Government, whatever you may say or conceive, some of the justices of this bench are the cause of this ap- pearance, and not me
 I have done this to prevent myself from being ille- gally taken to Philadelphia
 My orders from the Government of Virginia, rot being explicit, but claiming the country about Pittsburgh, I have raised the militia to support the civil authority of that colony vested in me
 "I am come here to free myself from a promise made to Captain Proctor [the sheriff], but have not conceived myself amenable to this court, by any authority from Pennsylvania, upon which account I can not apprehend that you have any right to remain here as justices of the peace constituting a court under that province; but, in order to prevent confusion, I agree that you may continue to act in that capacity, in all such matters as may be sub- mitted to your determination by the acquiescence of the people, until I may have instructions to the contrary from Virginia, or until his Majesty's pleasure shall be further known on this subject
" 2This was the letter of March 3, 1774—Dunmore to Penn—previously given
 •The answer of the Westmoreland Court to Conolly's paper was as follows: "The jurisdiction of the court and officers of the county of Westmore- land rests on the legislative authority of the Province of Pennsylvania, con- firmed by his Majesty in council
 That jurisdiction has been regularly -exercised, and the court and officers will continue to exercise it in the same Tegular manner
 It is far from their intention to occasion or foment dig-

 Their number was about one hundred and eighty or two hundred
 On their return to Pitts- burgh, some of them seized Mr
 Elliott, of the Bullock Pen,1 and threatened to put him in the stocks for something which they deemed an affront offered to their commander
 Since their return, a certain Edward Thompson and a young man who keeps store for Mr
 Spear, have been arrested by them; and Mr
 Connolly, who, in person, seized the young man, would not allow him time even to lock up the store
 In other parts of the county, particularly those adjoining the Monongahela, the magistrates have been frequently insulted in the most indecent and violent manner, and are apprehensive that, un- less they are speedily and vigorously supported by the Government, it will become both fruitless and dangerous for them to proceed in the execution of their offices
 They presume not to point out the measures proper for settling the present disturbances, but beg leave to recommend the fixing of a temporary line with the utmost expe- dition, as one step, which, in all probability, will contribute very much toward producing that effect
 For further particulars concerning the situation of this country, I refer you to Colonel Wilson, who is kind enough to go on the present occasion to Philadelphia

 In order to contribute to this very salutary purpose, they give information that every step will be taken on the part of the Province of Pennsylvania to accommo- date any differences that have arisen between it and the Colony of Virginia, by fixing a temporary line between them

 It was directed to " William Crawford, Esquire, and his Associate Justices of Westmoreland County/' and was as follows: "Gentlemen: The present alarming Situation of our Affairs in Westmore- land County, occasioned by the very unaccountable conduct of the Govern- ment of Virginia, requires the utmost Attention of this Government, and therefore I intend, with all possible Expedition, to send Commissioners to expostulate with my Lord Dunmoro upon the Behavior of those he has thought proper to invest with such Power as hath greatly disturbed the

V CARLISLE, April 28, 1774
 Sir:—In conversation with Colonel Wilson the other day, he men- tioned a transaction in Virginia, which if it be as he represents it, will throw some light upon what has heen the "sense of that Colony, with regard to the country about Fort Pitt
" Colonel Stephens,2 it seems, in the year 1764, when that fortress was be- Peace of that country
 As the Government of Virginia hath the Power of raising a Militia, and there is not any such in this Province, it will bo in vain to contend with them in the way of Force; the Magistrates, therefore, at the same Time that they continue with steadiness to exercise the Juris- diction of Pennsylvania with respect to the distributions of Justice und punishment of Vice, must be cautious of entering into any such contests with the Officers of my Lord Dunmore, as may tend to widen the present unhappy Breach; and, therefore, as Things are at present circumstanced, I would not advise the Magistracy of Westmoreland County to proceed by way of criminal prosecution against them for exercising the Government of Virginia
 "I flutter myself that our Commissioners to Virginia will succeed accord- ing to our Expectations, and that our Affairs to the Westward will soon be put upon a peaceable and quiet Footing
 I am, etc
" It is necessary to mention, at this point, an occurrence which took place two days subsequent to the date of the above letter, for the reason that it has an important bearing on the events following; and, for the further rea- son, that, in the letters of StSt. Clair, no account is given of it: On the 8th of April, the justices, 
/Eneas Mackay, Deverenx Smith, and Andrew McFarlane, returned from court at Hannastown to their homes in Pittsburgh
 The next day they were arrested by a Virginia deputy sheriff, at Conolly's instigation, and, on refusing to give bail, were sent off under guard to Stnunton, county-town, at that period, of Augusta county, Vir- ginia
 After traveling one day together, Mr
 Mackay, one of the three justices, got permission to go to Williamsburg to see Lord Dunmore
 After some conversation with his Lordship, the latter wrote to the sheriff, request- ing him to allow the prisoners to return home
 Mncliny immediately pro- ceeded to Staunton, and his fellow-prisoners were at once liberated
 1Benjamin Chew was born in Anne Arundel county, Maryland, No- vember 29, 1722
 He was a lawyer by profession, and settled in 1743 on the Delaware, but in 1754 removed to Philadelphia, where he held respectively the offices of Recorder, Register of Wills, and Attorney-General
 He be- came Chinf Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the day after the above letter was written
 He had been a member of the Provincial Coun- cil of Pennsylvania for a number of years, and as such was written to by StSt. Clair at this date

 He was a captain in the Ohio expedition of 1754, serving with distinction under Braddock

 I have heard, sir, that you are to go to Williamsburg,2 and im- agined in that case, this hint would not be disagreeable
 I wish you a pleasant journey
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, May 29, 1774
 I doubt not before this time you have expected some account from me of the situation of this country, but as I could not write with certainty respecting the intentions of the Indians I chose to defer it
3 1This was during the so-called "Conspiracy of Pontiac
" The siego spoken of by StSt. Clair wns in 1763
 2That is, StSt. Clair bad been informed that Chew was to be one of the Commissioners appointed by the Government of Pennsylvania to treat with the Governor of Virginia, on the subject of the disturbances in Westmore- land county; but the persons so appointed were James Tilghman and An- drew Allen—both members of the Provincial Council
 They were "to treat and agree with the Right Honorable John, Earl of Dunmore, Governor of Virginia, concerning the Settlement of the Western Bounds and Limits of the Province of Pennsylvania, and preserving the Public Peace and Tranquillity on the Borders," etc
 2This is the first bint, in this correspondence, of the animosity between the Virginians on the one side, and the Mingoes and Shawunese on the other, which finally brought on what is known in history as "Lord Dun- more's War
" One of the causes of these troubles was the general antag- onism of the red and white races, then being brought nearer and nearer each other as the Virginians continued to survey land and make settlements down the Ohio
 Concerning the first overt acts on each side, accounts of that period differ somewhat, as shown by the following (See The Wathing- tonrCrawford Letters

 In the first place, they killed one Murphy, a trader, and wounded another; then robbed their canoes
 This alarmed the gentlemen very much; and Major Crosap took a party of men and waylaid some Indians in their canoes, that were going down the river, and shot two of them and scalped them
 He also raised a party, took canoes find followed some Indians from Wheeling down to the Little Kanawba;

 297 In my last to Mr
 Shippen I think I mentioned that Mr
 Croghan had sent a Delaware chief (White Eyes) with two of our traders with a message1 to the Shawanese; their return had been impatiently expected
 Tired at last with the suspense, I determined to go to Fort Pitt whatever might be the consequence, and am just returned from thence
 I was lucky enough to arrive there the day they came in, and though their accounts are alarming enough, yet I can not think they are equal to the panic that has seized the country
 The Shawauese message is insolent enough; and we have a cer- tain account that twenty of their warriors are gone out, but we have still reason to'think they do not mean mischief to the people here, as they lay all to the charge of the Big Knife, as they call the Vir- ginians
 The substance of their speech is, that they think what when, coming up with them, he killed three and wounded several
 The In- dians wounded three of his men, only one of whom is dead; ho was shot through, while the other two were but slightly wounded
 On Saturday last, about twelve o'clock, one Greathouse, and about twenty men, fell on a party of Indians at [opposite] the mouth of Yellow Creek, and killed ten of them
 They brought away one child a
 prisoner, which is now at my brother William Crawford's
 This alarm has caused the people to move from over the Monongahela, off Chartier's and Raccoon [Creeks], as fast as ever you saw them in the year 1756 or 1757, down in Frederick county, Virginia- There were more than one thousand people crossed the llonongahela in one day at three ferries that are not one mile apart

 "Sir:— 
 
 • "The surveyors that went down the Kanuwha, as report goes, were stopped by the Shawanese Indians, upon which some of the white people attacked some Indians and killed several, took thirty horse-loads of skins near the mouth of Scioto; on which news, and expecting an Indian war, Mr
 Cresap and some other people fell on some other Indians at the mouth of Pipe Creek, killed three, and scalped them
 Daniel Greathouse and some others fell on some nt the mouth of Yellow Creek and killed and scalped ten, and took one child about two months old, which is now at my house
 I have taken the child from a woman that it had been given to
 Our inhabitants are much alarmed, many hundreds having gone over the moun- tain, and the whole country evacuated as far as the Monongahela; and many on this [the east] side of the river are gone over the mountain
 In short, a war is every moment expected
 We have a council now with the Indians
 What will be the event I do not know
"— William Crawford to Washington, May 8, 1774
 1 What Mr
 Croghan sent in this message was, in substance, "that the outrages which had been committed, were done by some of our ill-disposed people, and without the least countenance from Government
" The Dela- wares, at this period, had their homes upon the Muskingum; the Shawanese bad theirs upon the Scioto

 Mr
 Croghan and Mr
 McKee say to them is lies; that they know the path is open from Philadelphia, and that they will keep it so if they please; but that the Big Knife has struck them, and when they have satisfaction they will speak to him, but not before, that now they have no King, and are all upon their feet, with other threatening expressions in their way
1 There were several chiefs of the Delaware's, and deputy of the Six Nations, (Goyasutha) with eight others of the Seneca tribe, at Pittsburgh, by Mr
 Crog- han's advice
 They were called together and I made a short speech to them;2 they received it with pleasure, and in return gave the strongest assurances that they wished for nothing more than to con- tinue in peace with this Province, and to become as one people
 I think there can be no doubt of the sincerity of the Delawares; they have given substantial proofs of it in the care they have taken of the traders that were to have gone to the Shawanese; and if the Six Nations are in the same disposition, the war will be of little conse- quence, but I fear it is to be doubted whether Goyasutha knows the sense of the league or not
 One of the traders who went with White Eyes was detained at 1" White Eyes returned here [Pittsburgh] the 24th of May, and brought with him ton white men, who had been protected by the Delawares eight days in their towns, and guarded safe to this place; he also brought a speech from the Delawares, from which wo have great reason to believe that they are not inclined for viar; we also believe that they will endeavor to preserve the lives of the traders that are now amongst the Shawneese: he also brought from the Shawneeso chief (called the hard man,) an answer to a speech sent to them by Mr
 Croghan, upon this occasion, in which ho signifies that the Shawnees are all warriors, and will not listen to us until they have satisfaction, for what injuries they have received from the Vir- ginians, etc
"—Devereux Smith to Dr
 Smith, from Pittsburgh, June 10, 1477r 2 The speech made by StSt. Clair was as follows: "Brothers of the Six Nations and Delawares: "The Governor of Pennsylvania has heard your good speeches, and I am, come from him to thank you for the care you have taken of our traders, and the pains you have been at to preserve the general peace
 Your brothers of Pennsylvania are determined to maintain the friendship subsisting be- twixt the Six Nations and Delawares and them entire, but as they are alarmed at the threatenings of the Shawanese, we recommend it to you to prevent your people from hunting on our side of the river for some time, as our people will not be able to distinguish betwixt them and those who may be enemies
 "We wish and will endeavor to keep the path open to onr brothers, and will on our parts keep bright that chain of friendship which has been so long held fast by their and our forefathers

 299 Newcomers Town;: they, it seems, thought it imprndent that more than oue should go very soon after the others left it
 They were met by a Shawanese man who fired at Duncan, within a very small distance, but fortunately missed him
 White Eyes immediately called to him to make back to the town, pnd he himself got betwixt the Indian and him, and came up with him where he had stopped to load his gun, and disarmed him; they both got safely back to the town, and were immediately shut up in a strong house, and a guard kept on them day and night to preserve them from any at- tempt that might be made by the Shawanese or Mingoes (a small part of these last live near the Shawanese, and are in a manner incorporated with them) and this was continued till White Eyes went down to the Shawanese town and returned, during all which time they were furnished with provisions and every thing that could be procured for them in the most liberal manner
 This I think must be an unequivocal mark of their disposition
 The mischief done by Cresap2 and Greathouse2 had been much exaggerated when I wrote to Mr
 Shippen, but the number of In- dians killed is exactly as I informed Mr
 Allen, viz: thirteen
4 1The site of the present New Comerstown, in Tuscarawas county, Ohio
 !The Pennsylvania account of "the mischief done by Cresap" was this- William Butler, a trader living in Pittsburgh, sent off a canoe from that place on the 15th of April, for the Shawanese towns on the waters of the Scioto
 This canoe was attacked by three Cherokee Indians, who killed one white man and wounded another
 About the 21st of April, Conolly, at Pittsburgh, wrote a letter to the inhabitants at Wheeling, telling them that he hud been informed by goo'd authority, that the Shawanese were ill-dis- posed towards the white men
 On the 24th of the same month, Mr
 Butler sent another canoe down the Ohio in care of some Shawanese and white men
 Cresap who was below, hearing of the murder by the Cherokees, and being informed of the contents of Conolly's letter to the inhabitants of Wheeling, fell upon the Indians in Butler's second canoe, killing two; he also killed another Sbawanese farther down the river
 2The "Yellow Creek Massacre," as it is called, took place opposite the mouth of Yellow Creek, April 30,1774
 It was then that Logan, the Mingo chief, lost his relatives—mother, brother and sister; not, however, by " Colonel Cresap," as he states in his famous speech, but at the hands of a party under the leadership of Daniel Grealhouse
 Logan's brother, who was among the slain was known as John Petty
 His sister who was also killed had with her a child two months old
 It was this child that was subsequently taken care of by "William Crawford, as previously stated
 4 Neither of these letters has been preserved
 StSt. Clair gives thirteen as the number of Indians killed by Cresap and his men and by Greathouse and big party; but, it must be remembered that a portion of these were Shawa-
Page 300

800 The StSt. Clair Papers
 Cresap has lately been in the neighborhood of Pittsburgh, with in- tention it appeared to pursue the blow he had before struck, but Mr
 Conolly sent a message to him forbidding him to attempt any thing against the Indians; this he has taken in high dudgeon, and declares publicly that what he did before was by Mr
 Conolly's orders; so that it is to be hoped some of the devilish schemes that have been carrying on here will come to light
 I ventured to say that an Indian war was part of the Virginia plan; I am satisfied it must at least be part of Mr
 Conolly's plan, for he has already in- curred such an expense by repairing the fortl and calling out the militia that I think it is impossible that Colony will ever discharge it unless disturbances be raised that may give his maneuvers the appearance of necessity
 It is scarcely possible to conceive the distressed situation of this country; one day the spirits of the people are raised a little, and some prospect of their being able to remain on their farms; the next a story worse than any they have heard before, and a thousand times worse than the truth, sinks them in despair; and those about Pittsburgh are still in a more pitiable state, being harassed and oppressed by the militia, who lay their hands on every thing they want without asking questions, and kill cattle at their pleasure; they indeed appraise them, when the owner happens to know of it, and give him a bill on Lord Dunmore, which is downright mockery
 nese; so that the story that thirteen Mingoes were to be revenged for by Logan, so current in history, is a fiction; besides, it is well known, that ho and his braves put to death more than that number of Virginians before his wrath was appeased
 1 StSt. Clair has here reference to Fort Pitt, which Conolly had taken pos- session of, changing the name to Fort Dunmore—which name, by the way, was never acquiesced in by Pennsylvanians
 After the fortification had been dismantled by order of the British government, in 1772, it was taken charge of by Edward Ward, a half-brother of Col
 Croghan, who had control of the grounds until Conolly with his militia took possession sometime in the spring of 1774
 In 1777, Ward's deposition was taken at Pittsburgh, a part of which was in the following words: "The deponent further saith that upon the evacuation of Fort Duquesne, by the French, on the approach of the British army General Forbes, by one of the Deputy Agents of Indian Affairs, made a request to the chiefs of the Six Nations for permission to re-establish a fort at the same place, for the purpose aforesaid, and to prevent the French from returning, which was granted; a fort executed and garrisoned, which continued in the possession of the British troops till the year 1772, when it was evacuated by them and taken posssession of by the deponent, who occupied the same till taken pos- session of by Major Conolly, in 1774, with the Virginia militia

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc, 301 From what I saw it was evident to me that the country must very soon be totally evacuated unless some thing was done to afford the inhabitants the appearance at least of protection
 I therefore con- sulted with some of the inhabitants of Pittsburgh, and Mr
 Mackay, Mr
 Smith, Colonel Croghan, Mr
 Butler and myself entered into an association to raise victuals, and pay a ranging company of one hun- dred men for one month, to which a number of the inhabitants, as I came down, readily acceded, and I think in a few days we will have it completed
 We flattered ourselves indeed that your Honor if you approve the measure, would take such measures with the House as would release us from the expense; but as you may probably want a formal requisition to lay before the House, I have acquainted you with it in another letter
 One thing further I had in view: the inhabitants of Pittsburgh propose stockading the town:l when that is done should your negotiation with Lord Dunmore miscarry, throwing a few men into that place would recover the country the Virginians have usurped
 I beg pardon for so long a letter, and
yet I believe I should have given you more but that I am detaining Mr

 I have only to request that you will please to give us your directions as soon as possible

—An affair that has given me much trouble and vexation had like to have escaped my memory, the murder of a Delaware Indian, Joseph "NVipey, about eighteen miles from this place
 It is the most astonishing thing in the world the disposition of the com- mon people of this country; actuated by the most savage cruelty, they wantonly perpetrate crimes that are a disgrace to humanity, and seem at the same time to be under a kind of religious euthu- siasm, whilst they want the daring spirit that usually inspires
 Two of the persons concerned in this murder are John Hinkson aud James Cooper
 I had got information of their design some time be- fore they executed it, and had written to Hinkson, whom I knew to be a leader amongst them, to dissuade them and threaten them with the weight of the law if they persisted; but so far from preventing them, it only produced the inclosed letter
2 The body was discovered hid in a small run of water, and covered with stones
 I immediately sent for the coroner, but before he had got 1 The town was not stockaded as proposed, although considerable work was done toward it

 I have issued warrants on suspicion, but they are BO much on their guard I doubt they can not be executed
 Your Honor will please to consider whether it may be proper to proclaim them; l it is most unlucky at this time
 The letter may perhaps be made use of as evidence

 McKee had not time to transcribe the speeches of the In- dians, but in a few days I shall probably receive them, and will for- ward them by the first opportunity
 Nobody offered the arrest they have threatened me so much with
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, May 29, 1774
 Sir:—The panic that has struck this country, threatening an en- tire depopulation thereof, induced me a few days ago to make an excursion to Pittsburgh to see if it can be removed, and the deser- tion prevented
 The only probable remedy that offered was to afford the people the appearance of some protection
 Accordingly Mr
 Smith, Mr
 Mackay, Mr
 Butler, and some others of the inhabitants of Pitts- burgh, with Colonel Croghan and myself, entered into an association for the immediate raising an hundred men, to be employed as a ranging company, to cover the inhabitants in case of danger, to which association several of the magistrates and other inhabitants have acceded and in a very few days they will be on foot
 We have undertaken to maintain them for one month, at the rate of one shilling and a sixpence a man per diem: this we will cheer- fully discharge, at the same time we flatter ourselves that your Honor will approve the measure, and that the Government will not only relieve private persons from the burden, but take effectual measures for the safety of this frontier, and this I am desired by the people in general to request of your Honor
 2 The Governor of Pennsylvania, in accordance with the suggestion made by StSt. Clair, did "proclaim them
" His proclamation offering one hundred pounds for their apprehension was dated July 28, 1774
 There is, however, no evidence extant that either were ever arrested for their supposed partici- pation in the killing of the Delaware Indian

 303 GEORGE CROGHAN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair, June 4, 1774
 Sir:—The frequent reports brought from Hanna's Town, of two hundred men being raising there, has alarmed Captain Conojly very much, and though I told Mr
 J
 Campbell the whole reason and in- teution was no more than to have a number of men to scout between the river Ohio and of inhabitants down to Ligonier, in order to pre- vent the flight of that part of said country; and in case of great necessity that those men would be offered to act with the Virginians for the general defense of the country
 Now, as both Conolly and Campbell know this measure is the only one to stay the people from flying, and see that the country will condemn Conolly and his officers for not pursuing the same measure, they want to make it appear in another light, and that the intention is to invade the rights of Virginia
 Now, the greatest caution and prndence is necessary, and I re- quest that you will station those parties to scout back of the settle- ments between Turtle Creek and Ligonier, which was our intention of having them, and take care that no threats against Virginia be made use of by any person concerned, as, since Mr
 Jo
 Campbell came up, I see the design is to create a fresh difference between Gov- ernor Penn and Lord Dunmore, which ought to be avoided with the greatest care
 Since Campbell came up affidavits are taken of every information that is brought up, and spies employed; though when he was informed of the murders committed on the Indians, he never took any measures to apprehend them
 He has made two attacks on me, by letters sent by a sergeant and twelve men, which letters I answered, but would not gratify him to send them by his party
 The truth is, they found this difference likely to be made up by the Indians, and find that nothing but misrepresenting our measures, and drawing on a fresh dispute between the Government of Penn- sylvania and Virginia, can keep this man in command; wherefore I have determined to go to Williamsburg myself, and represent the state of the country, as soon as I hear the event of our last mes- sages to the Indians, by the deputies, which I believe will be in five or six days, and I flatter myself entirely satisfactory to every well- wisher of the peace and tranquillity of the country
 Before I go you and I must have a meeting, that you may be able to inform the Governor what I am going about; but I would have you settle the scouting party so as to act with prndence, and give

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LAUREL HALL, June 7, 1774
 Sir:—When I had last the honor to write to you, I acquainted you with a plan that had been fallen upon to raise some men for the defense of this country
 The day before yesterday about forty marched from Hanna's Town to Turtle Creek, where they would be joined by another party
 The number I do not exactly know, but it is in- tended that that post should be sixty men strong; and a number were, at the same time, engaged for the other necessary posts, so that the whole will form a chain of rangers on our frontier
 The subscribers requested me to take them under my direction, and in consequence I did give them orders which I will send to your Honor by the first opportunity—now I have not time to copy them; and, as I know the gentleman who carries this, I came here on purpose to see him, for should this matter go farther, he has connections in town that have weight with the House
 Mr
 Croghan's views I do not pre- tend to see, but this you may be assured of, he is at present a friend to this country, and if it depends on him we shall yet have no war; hitherto it has been my opinion we would have no war; I now be- gin to think otherwise; but my reasons for thinking so depend on such circumstances as can scarce be communicated
 The most alarm- ing one, however, is the retreat of the Moravian Minister
 A great town of the Delawares has been, in some measure, civilized by these people, and spiritual guides in all countries have ways of knowing the intentions of their flocks; l another is, that on Sunday last a council was mtended with the Delawares and Six Nations at Mr
 Croghan's, but the day before they went off to prevent a party of Shawanese, as they say, from falling on the white people
 A little time will show whether that was their design or not
 Mr
 Jennings, the late sheriff of Northampton, who is now here, will, I believe, be in town
 It is not improbable he knows more than he discovers to me
 He is engaged in the Indian trade, and his partner is 1 Reference is here made to the Moravian missionary establishments among the Delawarcs, upon the Tuscarawas River, in what is now Tusoarawas county, Ohio, under the charge of David Zeisberger

 GOVERNOR PENN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, June 1th, 1774
 Sir:—I have received your letter of the 29th of May, by ex- press, inclosing your speech to the Indians, and think it an extra- ordinary letter
 I shall consult my council upon the propriety of issuing a proclamation for apprehending him,1 which is a measure I dare say they will advise
 I am much pained to find your country is in so terrible a situa- tion as you represent it, and think you have acted very wisely in entering into an association to raise men, which I hope will qniet the minds of the people and answer the purpose of keeping them from totally leaving the country
 You may depend upon my doing every thing that lays in my power, to relieve you from the expense of maintaining the com- pany of men you mention
 You will receive as soon as possible two hundred muskets with powder and lead, which you will dispose of in the best manner to such persons as will return them when they are of no further use to them
 Those members of Assembly who live in town, approve much of my doing every thing that may be necessary for your protection and have sent summonses to all the members that live within twenty miles of the town to meet on Friday next to consult upon what will he proper to be done immediatelv; and if by any further intelli- gence from your county it should appear necessary, I shall then call the Assembly
 Wagons with the arms and ammunition will set off this after- noon or early to-morrow morning
 They will be consigned to Mr
 Montgomery at Carlisle who will be desired to forward them to you

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LHJONIER, June 8, 1774
 Sir:—Since I wrote to you yesterday I have received two letters1 from Mr
 Croghau, which I now inclose
 Though he seems to say that peace may be continued, I believe it is not his sentiments; and the circumstance of his going to Williamsburg, whatever design he may avow, is to be out of the way of danger: for he dare neither trust the white people nor the Indians
 We have a certain account of some mischief having been done up Cheat lliver
 Eight or nine people are killed ; but whether it is only designed as revenge, or is really the beginning of a war, we can not yet judge ;2 I shall, however take earliest opportunity to in- form you of what passes
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, June 12, 1774
 Sir:—In my last letter I had the honor to inform you, that in consequence of the ranging company which had l>een raised here, there was reason to hope the people would return to their planta- tions and pursue their labors; and for some time, that is, a few days, it had that effect; but an idle report of Indians having been seen within the party, has driven them every one into some little fort or other, and many hundreds out of the country altogether
 This has obliged me to call in the parties from where they were 1Only one of these letters—that of Juno 4
 1774, previously given—has been preserved
 2It was both, as it proved
 The "mischief" spoken of was the work of Logan, the Mingo ebief, in revenge for the killing ot his relatives at Hnker's Holtom, opposite the mouth of Yellow Creek, on the 30th of April, previous
 It WHS on Dunkanl's Creek, about ten miles from the mouth of Cheat River, on the west-side of the Monongnhela, that the irate chief began his work of death—began, in fact, "Lord Dunmore's War
" Logan had with him a small number of Mingoes and Shawanese from AVakntomiea, an Indian town upon the Muskingum, near what is now Dresden, Muskingum county, Ohio
 At this time, about ten persons were killed
 The whole country WHS in forts; that is, what was left of them on either side of the Monongahela— the greater part having gone over the mountains for safety

 307 posted, and have stationed them, twenty men at the Bullock Pens, twenty men at Turtle Creek, thirty at Hanna's Town, twenty at Proctor's, and twenty at Ligonier; as these places are now the fron- tier towards the Alleghauy, all that great country betwixt the road 1 and that river being totally abandoned, except by a few who are as- sociated with the people who murdered the Indians, and are shut up ill a small fort on CYmnymack [Conemaugh], equally afraid of the Indians and officers of justice
 Nothing can be more surprising than the dread the people are under, and it is truly shameful that so great a body of people should have been driven from their possessions without even the appear- ance of an enemy; for certain it is, as yet, no attempt has been made on what is understood to be Pennsylvania, nor any other mischief done than the killing the family on Whitelick Creek, which I informed you of before, and which, from every circiftnstance, ap- pears rather to have been private revenge than a national stroke
 A fresh report of Indians being seen near Rarma's Town, and another party on Braddock's Road, set the people agoing again yes- terday
 I immediately took horse and rode up to inquire, and found it, if not totally groundless, at least very improbable; but it was impossible to persuade the people so, and I am certain I did not meet less than a hundred families, and I think two thousand head of cattle, in twenty miles riding
 The people in this valley still make a stand; but yesterday they all moved into this place, and I perceive are much in doubt what to do
 Nothing in my power to prevent their leaving the country shall be omitted, but if they will go I suppose I must go with the stream
 It is the strangest infatuation ever seized upon men; and if they go off now, as harvest will soon be on, they must undoubt- edly perish by famine, for spring crop there will be little or none
 By a letter from Mr
 Mackay, of yesterday, I had a very extra- ordinary piece of intelligence, "that Lord Dunmore had empow- ered Mr
 Conolly to settle a line of jurisdiction with the Pennsyl- vania magistrates
" This, it seems, he gives out himself, but it is too absurd to be believed
 It would give much pleasure to the friends of Government in this part of the country, to hear that 1 The two principal roads leading out of Pittsburgh, at that date, eastward, were " Forbes' Road" and''Braddouk's Road
" Leaving Fort Pitt by tic first-mentioned route, the traveler would reach the Bullock Pens, in seven miles; Ilanmistown, is something over thirty; Ligonier, in fifty-six; and Bedford, in about one hundred miles
 It was this road that StSt. Clair refers to
 Braddork's Road was to the south of this

 your commissioners had succeeded in that business, as it seems to be the only thing that can restore us peace and order

—I have just heard that Mr
 Conolly has sent a party of militia down to Wheeling, with orders to fall ou every Indian they meet, without respecting friend or foe
2 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, June 16th, 1774
 Sir:—There is very little alteration in the affairs of this coun- try since my last, which was a few days ago, only we have a certain account of two more people being killed by the Indians, one Mr
 McClure, and Kincaid, the person for whom you lately issued a special commission of the peace
 They, it seems, were leading a party of forty men to join Capt
 Conolly at Wheeling, and were attacked by four Indians who made their escape without so much as being fired at
" Before this accident Mr
 Conolly had determined to march from 1On the 12th day of May, 1774, James Tilghman and Andrew Allen, commissioners of Pennsylvania, appointed to meet Lord Dun more for a con- ference with regard to the Boundary Troubles, left Philadelphia, und arrived in Williamsburg on the Kith following
 The business was soon opened; but, after u conference which lasted until the 'J7th of that month, it ended in nothing whatever being accomplished; Lord Dunmore declaring that in no event would ho yield jurisdiction over Fort Pitt, which put an end to the meeting
 StSt. Clair, however, had not received, ut the date of the above let- ter, information of the failure of the commission
 2 Particulars of the mishap which befel this party are given by StSt. Clair, in his letter to Penn, of June 1C, 1774, which follows
 3 "June 13th [1774]
 "VVe have this morning received Certain accountt from Ten-Mile Creek, (which Empties into the Mononguhcla ten miles above Redstone Fort) that on the llth Inst
 Francis McClure was killed &one Sam- uel Kinkadc badly wounded
 These men were heading a Party in Pursuit of Logan, McClure as Captain & Kinkade Lient
, and Oweing to their bad Conduct, they advanced some considerable distance ahead of their men snd were discovered by Logan, when the Party came up they found their Captn kill'd & Lient wounded; part of them stayed to take care of the wounded, and the Rest pursued the Indians

 From this it would seem that StSt. Clair was mistaken in supposing the party were marching to join Conolly at Wheeling

 Pitt, (which he now calls Ft
 Dunmore,) with three or four hun- dred men he had embodied for the purpose of chastising the Shaw- anese, to erect forts at Wheeling1 and Hockhoeking * to overawe the Indians and from thence to carry war into their own country; of this he was pleased to inform me by letter,3 and to desire I would act in concert with him
 You may be assured, sir, I shall be cautious of taking any step that may have the most distant tendency to draw this Province into active share in the war they have had no hand in kindling, but I have since received accounts that the above murders instantly changed the plan, and Mr
 Con- oily remains in garrison
 'Tis said some of his parties discovered a very large party of In- dians crossing the Ohio below Wheeling
 If that be true, as it is not improbable, we may expect soon to hear of much mischief be- ing done, as there is not the least doubt of several small parties being out at this time
 Tis some satisfaction the Indians seem to discriminate betwixt us and those who attacked them, and their revenge has fallen hitherto on that side of the Monongahela, which they consider as Virginia,4 but lest that should not continue, we are taking all possible care to prevent a heavy stroke falling on the few people who are left in this country
 Forts at different places so as to be more convenient, are now nearly completed, which gives an appearance of security for the women and children, and with the ranging parties, which have been drawn in to preserve the communication, has in a great degree put a stop to the unreasonable panic that had seized them, but in all of them there is a great scarcity of ammunition, and sev- eral messengers have returned from below without being able to purchase
 I am very anxious to know whether the ranging companies are agreeable to your honor or not, both because the expense of con- tinuing them will be too heavy for the subscribers, and that I am every day pressed to increase them
 This I have positively re- fused to do till I receive your Honor's instructions, and I well know how averse our Assemblies have been formerly to engage in the de- 1 The site of the present city of that name, in West Virginia

 MACKAY TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PITTSBURGH, 17ih June, 1774
 My Dear Sir :•—I have the pleasure to inform you that Butler,1 Blain,2 and several other traders, are just arrived with their skins, guarded by three Shawanese chiefs, and our greatest dread is now that the militia will attempt to kill or otherwise abuse these prinei- pal men, as they are so easy to come at; however we have some- trusty hands to lead them through the woods to Col
 Croghan's, which we look upon to be a place of safety
 The traders inform us that they have not been under confinement at all, and that they have been exceedingly well treated by all the Shawanese
3 We will have no war yet, unless our neighbors will force them to it
 1 Richard Butler
 He, in company with his brother William, was engaged as a trader, at this period, with the Shawanese
 They had been doing a large business for a number of years, from Pittsburgh
 It may be here mentioned that these brothers took an important part in the Revolution, and that Richard was u Major-General in the Indian war which followed that contest
 2 Ephraim Blaino
 * Richard Butler, after his arrival at Pittsburgh, gave an interesting ac- count of his escape from the Indian country
 It wns in sub-tance this: On hearing the news of the killing of the Jlingoes by Grcathouso and his party ut Baker's Bottom, on the 30th of April, three men and a boy, who were Mingoes, and one Shawanese, set off to the Ilockhoeking, with an intent to revenge the dood upon the traders there
 On hearing of this, the Shawa- neso head men pent four of their own people and one Mohican to preserve Butler and the residue of the traders at that point
 This was faithfully done; for when the war party came to the camp of the Pennsyivanians, they were met by the others, who prevailed on them to return homo
 When Butler and tho other traders were ready to start for Pittsburgh, the Shawanese chief, Cornstalk, sent his brother to escort tho whole of them to Pittsburgh, although, before they left, tha report that Logan and his friends had taken up the hatchet against the Virginians in revenge for his relatives slain, reached the Shawanese before their departure
 The Indian escort, composed

—Mr
 Butler informs me, he has a speech for the inhabitants of the forks of the Two Rivers, meaning our Province; and Blain has a speech to deliver to Mr

4 JAMES TILGHMAN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, June 2tM, 1774
 Sir:—The Governor has received your dispatches by Mr
 Hooper and 
Mr
 Jacobs who had by packet from Mr
 Elder
 I just take this opportunity by a person going off to-day, to let you know that we «mld not bring my Lord Dunmore to any reasonable temporary lines
 We offered the Monongahela which he would not agree to; so that the peace and quiet of the country must in a great measure depend on the confidence of those in command on both sides till we can get orders from home to have the boundaries of Penn'a settled, which Lord Uunmore assured us he would use every endeavor to expedite
 I find you have niiscd some rangers to encourage the people to continue their settlements; great care should be taken that they give no offense or umbrage to the Indians, who should be made sensible that nothing is intended, but to keep the people to the settlements, unless the Indians should oblige them to act of- fensively
 It seems as if there were no good understanding between Croghau and Connolly
 I do not know how sincere Croghan may be, nor would I jndge uncharitably, but his sentiments are just
 We had some intimation when at Williamsburg and I have heard since I came home that Lord Dnnmore has interested himself in the lands about Pittsburgh
 I wish you would inquire into that of one Shawnnese, one Mingo mid a Mohican, proved faithful to their trust and delivered their charges in safety at Pittsburgh
 The fears of Mackay that the militia would •• attempt to kill or otherwise obuso" the three Indians, were well-founded
 It required great caution and considerable trouble on the part of the traders nnd Colonel Croghan to pro- tect them, BO intense was the excitement among the Virginians at Pittsburgh against savages in general at the time
 On their way home, tho Mohican was actually wounded, near tho month of Heaver, by a scouting party; how- ever, it is not certain that they had knowledge of tho pacific intention of these Indians
 'The speech brought in by Butler has not been found
 The one intrusted to Blaine was directed to Croghan and Conolly
 It was from tho chief, Cornstalk
 He sent his good intentions to the Governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia; hoped that peace would be maintained, and that no more In- dians would be killed

 matter, and transmit me what intelligence you can gain of it
 The Governor will write you by the first opportunity
 He is out of town to-day and knows not of this
 Conolly wrote Lord Dunmore a very flattering account of his ex- pedition against the court house for which we are
 informed he got a sharp reprimand instead of the applause he expected
 When we applied for the discharge of the magistrates his Lordship told us he had already given orders for that purpose
 Lord Dunmore told us he would instruct his people to be very pacific and inoffensive,and not to give an occasion of difference
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGOXIER, June 22, 1774
 Sir:—In my last I informed you of Mr
 Croghan setting out for Williamsburg, since which I had a letter from him from his own house
 He therein informed me that he found the country so much alarmed at his going down, that he chose to return, and trust his business to letters, and desired to see me as soon as jxissible
 Accordingly I set out for Pittsburgh the 17th inst
, and had the happiness to find two of the principal traders arrived there with a great quantity of peltry, and that they had been conducted there by some of the Shawauese chiefs, and that the rest of the traders, with their horses and skins, were got as far as the Newcomer's Town, under the protection of another Shawanesc party
 The traders inform us that they have met with no ill treatment from the Shawauese; but, on the contrary, they were at the great- est pains, to protect them from the Mingoes, who had suffered most from the white people, and who came to their town several times, with the intention to murder them
 It seems they did not think it prudent to bring the Shawanese to Pittsburgh, but conducted them from some distance below that place, through the woods to Colonel Croghan's
 Mr
 Conolly ordered out a party of forty men to make them prisoners, as he says
 The people of the town were alarmed at seeing a party march out the route they took, and suspected they were intended to attack a party of our people stationed at the Bullock Pens, about seven miles from thence, which it seems has some time been threatened, and acquainted me with what they feared
 I immediately waited on Mr
 Conolly, and insisted, in direct terms, he should tell me if he had any such design
 He assured me he had not, but that, as
Page 315

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 315 the Shawanese had committed depredations on his Majesty's subjects, he had ordered out that party to make those prisoners who had escorted the traders; and that might have been his real intention; but I am convinced those who were to put it in execution would not have made prisoners
 We put it out of their power to do either, by sending them over the river
 Your Honor will jndge from this circumstance that the crew about Fort Pitt (now Fort Dunmore), are intent on a war, for were not that the case, honor, generosity, gratitnde, every manly principle, must have prompted them to be kind, and afford protection to those poor savages, who had risked their own lives to preserve the lives and property of their fellow-subjects
 But why need I mention this circumstance? One at least as strong is, that John Drinuing, who publicly acknowledged, or rather boasted, of having killed the In- dians, with Mr
 Cresap, is one of Mr
 Conolly's lientenants, and is at the present time out somewhere with the command of a party to take scalps, from friends I suppose; a murderer, I am sure, will never meet an enemy on fair terms
 I mentioned something of a condolence in my last, and as the Shawanese were up, I suffered myself to be pursuaded by Mr
 Crog- han to collect a small present of goods for that purpose, which was on Sunday morning to have been divided and sent to the three na- tions, the Six Nations, Shawanese, and Delawares; but Mr
 Con- nolly's frolic prevented it that day
 Next morning, the Indians, being some Six Nations, and some Delawares, were brought down to Mr
 Croghan's, and were shown the condolence, and acquainted that it was ordered for them by you, and that when their chiefs arrived they would be spoken to, and the present delivered, and a messenger was sent after the Shawauese to acquaint them likewise
 As the Indians themselves made a distinction betwixt us and our neighbors, it may perhaps be a means of keeping peace in our qu:ir- ter at least
 I hope your Honor will not be offended at my taking this upon myself
 The value of the goods is but trifling, not ex- ceeding thirty or forty pounds
 I have inclosed a list of them, but the person from whom I got them neglected to affix the prices
 Whatever may be Mr
 Croghan's real views, I am certain he is hearty in promising the general tranquillity of the country; indeed, he is indefatigable in endeavoring to make up the breaches, and does, I believe, see his mistake in opposing the interests of your Government; and I doubt not but a very little attention would render him as serviceable as ever
 Real friendship you must not ex- pect, for, by his interest alone he is regulated, yet he may Iw useful,

 as by and by you will probably want to make another purchase
 I purposely gave him an opportunity of opening a correspondence with me, which he embraced, and from what I can see, he would be glad to he on better terms with your officers than he has been; but this is only conjecture
 With this, your Honor will receive an extract from Mr
 McKee's journal of all the transactions with the Indians, from the beginning of the troubles, as also another of Mr
 Connolly's advertisements
1 I know not well what he means by it, but I believe his design is to distress the Indian trade
 It is true what I mentioned about the boundary
 Mr
 Connolly read me a part of a letter from Lord Dunmorc ou the- subject
 He says the demands of the Pennsylvauians were so extravagant that he could do nothing with them, but that he (Connolly) may settle a line of jurisdiction with the magistrates of Westmoreland, ten or twelve miles eastward of Pittsburgh, or a more convenient dis- tance, and cautious him at the same time not to give just cause of offenpe to the magistrates acting under the authority of this Province
 I know not how the magistrates were to settle lines
 I received your Honor's favor of 7th inst
, and am happy to inform you the panic is in some measure over
 The ammunition has not yet come to hand, but a quantity arrived from Carlisle which eased the people's minds a little, but the damage to the country by the desertion of the people and the loss of the Spring crop is very great, and if any thing should happen to interrupt the harvest we must have an absolute famine
 This I hope will not be the case
 Logan is returned with thirteen sculps and a prisoner, and says he will now listen to the chiefs
2 •Conolly's advertisement was in these words: "Whereas th« Shawaneso have perpetrated several murders upon tho In- habitants of this Country which has involved this promising Settlement in the mo-t calamit'-us distress; and whereas I have good reason to believe that certain imprudent people continue to carry on a correspondence with, and supply the said Enemies with dangerous Commodities to the infinite prejudice of His Majesty's subjects, and expressly contrary to an Act of As- sembly prohibiting such unwarrantable intercourse: These are therefore in His Majesty's Name, strictly to require and command all His Majesty's Subjects, to take notice hereof and to deport themselves as the law directs, as they may be assured that a contrary conduct will draw on them the utmost severity thereof

 LIGONIER, June, 26th, 1774
 Sir:—I have the honor to transmit a memorial from the inhabit- ants of Pittsburgh to your Honor, with some remarks upon Mr
 Conolly's conduct in support of it, which came to my hands a few minutes ago
1 It is most certain, sir, they are most injuriously buried the Iwtehet, having slain just as many of the "Long Knives" as the Virginians killed of Mingoes
 But his rest was only temporary; he after- ward penetrated a considerable distance into Virginia—he and his braves killing as they went
 Up to the last of June, or to the time of the date of the above letter, he had already taken sixteen scalps

 '•The memorial of the subscribers, in behalf of themselves and the re- maining few inhabitants of Pittsburgh who have adhered to the Governor of Pennsylvania, humbly sheweth: That your memorialists have suffered in an unprecedented manner by the arbitrary proceedings of Doctor Conolly, since the commencement of his tyrannical Government at Pittsburgh
 The principal facts we shall beg leave to lay before your Honor, as followcth: Soon after the return of the magistrates of this place from Staunton jail in Vir- ginia, Mr

 Butler, and some other friends, conveyed the Indians and their presents over the river, just as the guards surrounded Mr

] "PITTSBURGH, June 25th, 1774
 "The Distress'd Inhabitants of tbis Place have just cause to Charge their present Calamity & Dread of an Indian War, Intirely to the Tyrannical and unprecedent Conduct of Doctor John Connolly, whose design, as we conceive, is to better his alrrnst desperate Circumstances upon the distress of the publick and the Ruin of our Fortunes, as will appear from the fol- lowing Facts: • 1st
 On the 25th day of January last, a number of disorderly persons as- sembled themselves here in Consequence of his advertisements, (as militia) who, when dispersing, wantonly or maliciously fired upon some friendly In- dians, in their Hutts on the Indian Shore, which Conduct, together with So unexpected an Appearance of so many People in Arms at a time, that they expected no Hostile Intention on our parts, greatly alarmed them, as ap- peared by Complaint made by them at u Council with Alexander Me [Kee], Ksq'r, Indian Agent, and some of the Inhabitants of this Place, a few days alter
 "'Jndly
 Michael Cresip[Cresnp],in vindication of his own Conduct, alledges that it was in Consequence of a Circular Letter from said Connolly, directed to the Inhabitants of the Ohio, that he murthered the Indians, and that in a manner that Savage Ferocity could scarce equal & in Cold Blood, without the least Provocation, amongst whom was some Delawares that had been employed by Mr
 William Butler to Carry Goods & tend to the Relief of his brothers, who was at that time in the Indian Country, all of which prop- erty they have been deprived of to a Considerable amount; also, every part of said Connolly's conduct to our friendly Indians convinces us that he means to force them to a war, as he both Refuses to protect & endeavors to murder those that, at the Risque of their lives Came with our Traders to protfict them ,fc to deliver assurances to the publick, which can be produced if required

 What may he the consequence God knows, but it is well if the traders do not suffer; their horses and peltry are not yet arrived
 "Sdly
 A large body of Armed men broke open Mr
 McKay's & Mr
 Smiths Back-yard Gates & Rescued the Villian Riolly, who was sworn constable for Westmoreland County at that time, and was confined for abusing said Mc- Kay in his own House; five of those men presented their Guns at Mr

 Smith, also one of the Party struck at Mr
 McKay with his Gun and broke it into pieces, whilst another presented his riflo through his Parlour wmdow

 McKay if she did not immediately set open the doors of her House, upon which she fled, but was Immediately assaulted by one Aston (a C'nj tain in said Connolly's Appointment) with u drawn Sword, who stabbed her in the Ann

 He sent an Armed Guard to Town, with a General Search "War- rant, to search every Housc in Town, without Exception, for the Effects of a man that died the evening before in their Fort, that some of themselves had Robbed his Corpse off
 In the Course of their Search they Broke Open u Chest in a Mans h:mse, that bears a Good Character here, and took out sev- eral Articles, and at the same time Insulted the owner

320 The StSt. Clair Papers
 Mr
 McFarlane has just arrived from Virginia, and reports that four companies are ou their march to Pittsburgh
 I think he must be mistaken, both as their militia law is expired, and that it is not an easy matter to conduct so large a body through an uninhabited country, where no magazines are established
 Any occurrences worthy of your notice shall be intimated by every opportunity
 GOVERNOR PENN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, June 28, 1774
 Sir:—The accounts which you have transmitted of the temper of the Indians, and the murders they have already perpetrated, are truly alarming, and give every reason to apprehend that we shall not long be exempt from the calamities of a savage war
 The de- sertion of that country in consequence of the panic which has seized the inhabitants, on this occasion, n
ust be attended with the most mischievous effects, and prove ruinous to the immediate sufferers, and distressing to the Province in general
 Every measure, there- fore, should be attempted to stop the progress of this evil, and to induce those who have already gone off, to return to their habita- tions; and, I must rely on you to exert all your prudence and ac- tivity for this purpose
 The steps which have already been taken appear to me very proper, and I have no doubt, but that you will continue your endeavours to restore the drooping spirits of the peo- ple, and inspire them with a resolution to stand their ground, at least till they are satisfied of the intentions of the Indians towards this Province
 You may assure them that Government sensibly feels the distresses of their situation—that it will be attentive to their interests, and afford them every assistance and protection in its power to give
 With this disposition, I have issued writs for convening the Assembly, on the 18th of next mouth; and shall immediately ou their meeting, lay this matter before them, and have reason to expect that such measures will be adopted as may effectually enable the Government to extend to them a relief, ade- quate to its wishes, and their wants
 In the mean time I shall give orders for such further supply of ammunition to be sent up as will be sufficient for the present occasion
 I have written to Sir William Johnson, informing him of the in- telligence we had received of these transactions, and requesting his interposition with the Six Nations, to use their influence with the Shawanese and Delawares, to prevent further hostilities on their
Page 321

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 321 part, and to assure them of the sincere intentions of this Govern- ment to continue their pacific disposition towards all our Indian brethren
 I have also written to Lord Dunmore, complaining of Conolly's outrageous and tyrannical behavior at Pittsburgh, and re- presenting the dangerous tendency his military operations may have to involve the Colonies in a general Indian War
 P
 S
—My Commissioners who attended Lord Dunmore, could not induce him to come into any reasonable temporary line of juris- diction, and therefore things must remain in the disagreeable situa- tion of interfering jurisdictions
 In this unhappy situation I am satisfied, you and the other magistrates will act a prudent part
 It is impossible in such a case to give particular directions
 With re- spect to the keeping up the rangers you have raised for the security of the inhabitants, I shall recommend it to the Assembly to defray the expense that shall accrue in that necessary measure; and I can not have the least doubt that they will approve of what has been done on tin's occasion, as also the continuance of the same forces, until their sentiments can be known

 I have hunted Mr

 I am now going in search of him to get the Governor's letter for you; but I will first tell you that the Assembly is called to meet the 18th of next mouth, and a considerable quantity of powder and lead is ordered to be sent up immediately ; and this is all — except the full approbation of your conduct — and it gave me great pleasure to hear one of the gentlemen of the council express his sentiments of you on this occasion
 I think there does not remain a doubt but your measures will be adopted by the Governor and Assembly, and your requests fully answered, but 1 The letter, by referring to the time when tho Assembly of Pennsylvania was to meet, shows that it was written some time in June, 1774

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LmoxiER, July 4th, 1774
 Sir:—I have the honor to inclose the last piece of Indian Intelligence, which came by Captain White Eyes a few days ago, and am very happy that affairs have so peaceable an aspect,1 yet I can not suppress my fears that it will soon be interrupted, as a large body of Virginians are certainly in motion
 Colonel Henry Lewis is ordered to the mouth of Kenhawa to build a fort there; and Major McDonald with about five hundred, is to march up Brad- docks road and down to Wheeling to build another there ; and Cresap, with three others, are appointed to raise ranging companies
 With such officers as Cresap, no good can be expected, so that it is very doubtful all attempts to preserve the tranquillity of the country will be fruitless
2 1The intelligence brought by White Eyes was, in effect, that he was re- turned from transacting the business which he had been sent upon by his brethren, the English; and that he now had the satisfaction to tell them that he hud succeeded in his negotiations with all those tribes of theseveral nations of Indians whom he had since seen and conferred with, upon the unhappy disturbances which unfortunately had arisen in the Spring between the fool- ish people of both parties, and that he had found all the nations fully dis- posed to adhere to their ancient friendship and the advice of their wise men
 2 In a proclamation issued by Lord Dunmore, April 25,1774, he recognized that Pittsburgh and its dependencies were "in some danger of annoyance from the Indians," and he ordered and required "the officers of the militia in that district to embody a sufficient number of men to repel any insult whatever," referring not only to the Indians, but to the Boundary Troubles as well
 Early in 3Iay, William Crawford, President of the Court of Westmore- land County, under Pennsylvania appointment, having accepted a captain's commission from Lord Dunmore, embodied, up the Monongahela and Youghiogheny, one hundred men, and proceeded down to Charticrs' Creek to

 323 The men that have been raised here we have thought proper to continue another month, as the harvest will, by that time, be over
 They have orders to assist and protect the people in the different quarters where they are posted, and I hope by that means that it will be secured
 The arms and ammunition are not yet arrived, but I hear they will reach that place to-morrow or next day
 Last week Mr
 Conolly issued an order to prevent any skins being removed from Pittsburgh, till they paid duty as in Virginia
 There has been some appearance of the old seed of the Black Boys, a number of the people had assembled to stop Mr
 Somons's goods, but I had got notice of it and sent a party to protect them, and have issued warrants against them
 Their ring-leader will cer- tainly be taken this day
 WILLIAM SMITH TO ARTHUR ST
 CLAHl
 PHILADELPHIA, July 5th, 1774
 Sir:—The proceedings of Conolly are shocking and a high disgrace to the Government from which he pretends his authority, as well as to this Government, for suffering such flagrant acts within its known jurisdiction
 No pains shall be spared you effectual and imme- diate relief
 When any thing falls in the way, Dr
 McKenzie will guard the people while they got their stock away
 He then went down the Ohio as far as Grave Creek to watch the motions of the Indians, but, seeing none, returned home with his command
 StSt. Clair seems not to have been advised of this, the first expedition down the Ohio, in "Lord Dunmore's War
" It will be remembered that early in June, Conolly proposed to send a con- siderable force down the river to build a stockade at Wheeling, and another at Hockhocking (StSt. Clair to Governor Penn, June 16th, ante)
 Captain William Crawford headed the force, which reached Wheeling without acci- dent, and commenced the erection of a fort there
 Meanwhile, Lord Dun- more planned two expeditions: one to march down the Kanawha, under Col
 Andrew Lewis, to erect a fort nt its mouth, and the other under Col
 Angus McDonald, to build one at Wheeling (which had already been an- ticipated by Conolly; and the work was actually begun by Crawford)
 "The Virginians, from their conduct, appear determined on a war
 Col- onel Lewis is supposed to be at the Canawes [mouth of the Great Kanawha] with 1500 men and several parties have gone from this place to join him
 Major McDonald, Mr
 Cresnp and others, are expected here shortly, who, it is said, are going down the river [Ohio] to build forts and station men at dif- ferent places

 JAMES WILSON1 TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 CARLISLE, July 7th, 1774
 Dear Sir:—I was favored with vour letter2 by Mr
 Anderson
 My connection with the county of Westmoreland, and the regard I have for some valuable friends there, lay me, ill my opinion, under an indispensable obligation to do them every little service in my power
 The sentiments of the gentlemen who joined with me in sending up the ammunition,2 are, I believe, upon this subject, the same
 We only did our duty, therefore, upon that occasion
 It will always give me a very sensible pleasure to testify these senti- ments; and if any opportunity shall occur in which you think I can be of the least use, I shall esteem it friendly in you to give me notice of it
 The Governor has summoned the Assembly to meet on the 18th of this mouth
 What measures that body will adopt in order to se- cure and protect the frontiers of the Province, it is impossible to foretell
4 In the interior parts of the Province the public attention is much engrossed about the late conduct of the Parliament with regard to America,5 and the steps which the Colonies ought jointly to take to maintain their liberties; against which, to say the least of the mat- ter, a very dangerous blow seems to be aimed
 A general Congress 1 Native of Scotland, lawyer of distinction, und afterwards signer of Dec- laration of Independence, etc
 2 This letter has not been found in the StSt. Clair Papers
 'Supplies sent to Westmoreland for use of the rangers raised by StSt. Clair to protect the frontiers
 4 When the Assembly met, Governor Penn communicated the facts set forth in the foregoing correspondence, asked that an appropriation be made to meet expenses incurred in arming the rangers, and that some method be devised for accommodating the Indian troubles
 Appropriation made by the Assembly, and the Governor advised to renew the pence with the In- dians, and offer to act as a mediator between the Indians and Virginia
 A reward of one hundred pounds was offered for apprehending John llinkson and James Cooper for the murder of the friendly Indian, Joseph Wipey

 With regard to the propriety of entering into a non-importation and non- exportation agreement, the opinions of the people in this Province, as well as the opinions of those in the other Provinces, are not, as far as I can learn, unanimous

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 HANNA'S TOWN, July 12, 1774
 Sir:—On Friday last I was honored with your letter of the 28th ult
, and I have now the satisfaction to acquaint you that the panic seems entirely over, and that numbers of people are returning daily
 It must be very grateful to every person concerned, as it is in a very particular manner to me, that their endeavors on this occasion has met with so full approbation from your Honor, and will most certainly induce them to exert themselves on future ones
 I had yesterday an opportunity to acquaint them, as also a very respectable body of people who were assembled here in consequence of a letter from the Committee of Philadelphia, of your determination to af- ford them every necessary assistance and protection
 I read to them that part of your Honor's letter, and they received it with great satisfaction and thankfulness
 1The meeting on the 15th was attended by the distinguished citizens of Pennsylvania: John Dickinson, Joseph Iteed, Thomas Fitzsimmons, and Thomas Mifflin attended from Philadelphia; James Wilson, Robert Magaw, and William Irvine from Cumberland
 The last two served as Colonels un- der StSt. Clair during the war
 James Wilson was a member of the com- mittee to prepare instructions to the delegates appointed to attend a general Congress
 The Assembly, on the 22d, voted that a Congress of Deputies ought to be held " for obtaining redress of American grievances, ascertain- ing American rights, upon the most solid constitutional principles, and for establishmg that union and harmony between Great Britain and the Colo- nies, which is indispensably necessary for the welfare and happiness of both

326 The StSt. Clair Papers
 I shall probably have occasion to write you again to-morrow, as I had, yesterday, a letter from Mr
 Croghau,1 desiring a conference on matters of great importance to the Province, which he would not trust in writing
 I believe, however, it is a proposal to open some trading place; that is, to form a town some where up the Alleghany, as the trading people must leave Pittsburgh
 Hinkston,2 with about eighteen men in arms, paid us a visit at court last week, and, I am very sorry to say, got leave to go away again, though there was a force sufficient to secure two such parties at the sheriff's directions
 I had got intelligence that they were to be there, and expected to be joined by a party of Cresap's people, for which rea- son the ranging party that were within reach had been drawn in, but none of the Virginians appeared
 It is said a commission has been sent him from Virginia; certain it is, he is enlisting men for that service
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, July 17th, 1774
 Sir:—The business Mr
 Croghan had to communicate was this: That the Virginians are determined to put a stop to the Indian trade with this Province, and that Messrs
 Simons, Campbell, and Conolly have obtained an exclusive privilege of carrying it on, on the frontiers of Virginia
 He recommends the laying out of a town up the Alleghany at the Kittanuing, to which the traders might retire, as they will certainly be obliged to abandon Pitts- burgh, and from which the trade might be carried on to as much advantage, as the distance from thence to Kuskuskies3 is much the same as from Pittsburgh, and a very good road
 He further re- commends the building of a small stockade there, to afford them protection in case of a war
 The Indians will certainly quit Pitts- burgh, as it is at the risk of their lives they come there, to which I was an eye-witness
 1 See StSt. Clair's letter of the 17th, to Governor Penn, following
 2 This is the same HinUston that was charged with being one of the party who murdered the Delaware, Joseph Wipey
 3 A Delaware Indian town, of the Mousey tribe or clan, situated at the Junction of the Shenango and M ahening rivers, in what is now Lawrence County, Pennsylvania
 The place was nearly north-west from the site of the proposed new town at "the Kittanning," upon the Allegheny—the spot where the present Kittanning, county seat of Armstrong County, is located

Page 327

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 327 Croghan further says, that unless somebody is sent up by the Government to speak to the Indians very soon, that we shall see no more of them, and that the Delawares, who are still friendly, will be debauched
 I beg you to excuse this incoherent scrawl, as I am obliged to be held up whilst I write it
 Hinkston has left the country
 JOHN CONOLLY TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 FORT DuNMORE,1 July 19th, 1774
 Dear Sir:—A report, which has too generally prevailed in this quarter, of the pacific disposition of the Indians, has unluckily lulled the inhabitants into supineness and neglect, the effects of which have been dismally experienced on the 13th inst
, upon Dunkard Creek, where six unfortunate people were murdered by a party of thirty- five Indians
 I have also received a letter from Colonel Lewis, acquainting me that the Shawauese had attacked a body of men near to his house, and had killed one and wounded another
 What- ever may be said of the cause urging the Indians to these steps will be little to the advantage of these suffering people; some immediate steps most undoubtedly ought to be pursued to check their insolent impetuosity, or the country in general will be sacrificed to their re- venge
 The people of the frontiers want nothing but the counte- nance of Government to execute every desirable purpose, and your Province appearing backward at this critical juncture will most indubitably be highly displeasing to all the western settlers
 I am determined no longer to be a dupe to their amicable professions, but, on the contrary, shall pursue every measure to offend them; whether I may have the friendly assistance or not of the neighboring coun- try will, I expect, depend much on your just representation of matters
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOHN CONOLLY
 LIGONLER, July 22d, 1774
 Sir:—I received your favor of the 19th, yesterday, by Doctor 1The new name given by Conolly to Fort Pitt
 Ho not only had pos- session of the fort, wiih a body of Virginia militia, ns he termed them, but bad made considerable repairs upon tho fortress

828 The StSt. Clair Papers
 McKenzie, and am extremely sorry for the misfortunes that have happened upon Dunkard Creek
 It is very true, the assigning this or that cause for the inroads which the Indians are frequently making will be of no manner of advantage to the sufferers; but I think the security into which the people had fallen arose, not so much from an idea of the pacific disposition of the Indians, as that the great armed force scut down the river would effectually cover them; in that expectation they were certainly wrong; it was an effect could never follow from such a cause
 I agree with you, something ought to be done to prevent the dep- redations the Indians may still make upon the inhabitants; that is, ample reparation ought to be made them for the injuries they have al- ready sustained, and an honest open intercourse established with them for the future
 This, I imagine, would be found a more cheap, easy, and expeditious manner of re-establishing the peace of this country than any offensive measures whatsoever; for, be assured, the rest of the nations will not sit tamely by and sec a people who have long been aiming at taking the lead amongst themselves cut off, or even much depressed, by the English
 The councils of this Province will, I hope, continue to be founded in justice, whether that may be displeasing to the western settlers or not; but you arc certainly wrong to imagine my representations have any influence in the matter
 I shall, however, represent mat- ters as they occur to those in Government in the light they appear to me, as I have done hitherto, and have uniformly declared that I saw not the least probability of war, unless the Virginians forced it on
 The different maneuvers up and down and across the river have now probably brought that event about; who may see the end of it God only knows
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, July 22d, 1774
 Sir:—For some days by-past we had a flying report that some people were killed upon Dunkard Creek, on the 15th instant, but that a story of that kind should come so slowly through a country exceedingly on the alarm, induced me to give no credit to it, and to endeavor to prevent its gaining credit in the country
 I con- sidered it as raised on purpose to prevent the execution of Conolly's orders to Cresap not to annoy the Indians, which I knew had been

 Monnby, Mr
 Maekay, and the inclosed deposition
1 Mr
 Maekay writes me the friends of Pennsylvania are determined to abandon Pittsburgh, and to erect a small stockade somewhere lower down the road (I suppose about Turtle Creek,2 where he has a fine plantation), to secure their cattle and effects till they see further what is to be done
 I had a letter from Conolly yesterday, in a style of familiarity I should not have expected, but of itself a very extraordinary one; if you should think it worth your while to look over it, I have inclosed it, and a copy of my answer
3 1 am still sanguine enough to hope this Province will escape the mischiefs of a war, as all the operations of the Indians are evidently aimed at the Virginians, and seem designed to show them how much they despise the notion of their carrying the war into their own country
 They have, however, a number of men at Wheeling, and Conolly was to march this day to reinforce them
 One of his parties who had crossed to the Indian side fell in with the last of our trader, peltry, escorted by some Delawares
 They took the trader and the Indians prisoners, and carried them to the mouth of Beaver Creek, where their captain (Hogland) lay
 He was exces- sively enraged to see them alive, and they were kept all night in that state of suspense that every moment would be the last; in the morning, however, they discharged them, on the trader's giving a bond of five hundred pounds, to satisfy Captain Conolly that the 1The following is the deposition referred to: "( Copy) July 15M, 1774

 Indians were Delawares
 I took the trader's deposition on it when last at Pittsburgh, which I also inclose
 I was very ill when I wrote last, of a bilious fever, but am hap- pily recovering
 I can not well recollect what I wrote, as it was not copied, it being Sunday and my clerk abroad; but unless mat- ters are likely to be soon settled about Pittsburgh, it will be abso- lutely necessary to erect a town at the Kittanning; the trade must else take its course by the lakes, which will carry it quite away from this Province, and the communication with Philadelphia will in time become very easy that way, and may now be done with very little land carriage
 There is an old trading path from thence to Frank's Town,1 on the Juniata, and another to the head of the West Branch of Susquehanua
 I have distributed the arms all over the country in as equal pro- portions as possible
 Captain Crawford, the President of our Court, seems to be the most active Virginia officer in their service
 He is now down the river at the head of a number of men, which is his second expedi- tion
 I don't know how gentlemen account for these things to themselves

 We are of opinion that it is absolutely necessary that immediate application should be made to Government in favor of the Delawares, that some steps may be taken to reward the fidelity of that people, especially such of them as will undertake to recounoiter and guard the frontiers of this Province, which they say they will do, from the hostile de- signs of the Shawanese; and as by that means they will be prevented from following their own occupations, it would be no more than right to supply their necessary wants, while they continue to de- serve it so well at our hands
 There is nothing but the dread my family are in of the Indians approaching this place in my absence that would prevent my going in person to see you at this time, in your present dangerous in- disposition
 I hope to hear by the bearer on his return of your getting the better of your disorder
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONXER, July 26, 1774
 Sir:—I have enclosed a letter I received last night from Mr
 Mackay, of Pittsburgh, together with the speeches and intelligence brought by White Eyes, and a deposition respecting some Indians having been seen in the country
1 I thought them of consequence 1The "speeches and intelligence," referred to by StSt. Clair, were as fol- lows: I
 [WniTE EYES'S SPEECH
] PITTSBURGH, July 23, 1774
 We are glad to hear from you the good speeches which you have now spoken to us, and it also gave us great pleasure to hear from our brethren of Pennsylvania, when they reminded us of that ancient friendship made by our wise forefathers, which they have at this time handed to us, desiring us to take fast hold of it
 Brethren, Sir William Johnson, with our uncles, the Five Nations, the Wyandots, and all the several tribes of Cherokees, and Southern Indians, have spoke to us of peace and friendship ; and you, our brethren of Vir- ginia, have likewise desired us to be strong in holding fast the chain of friendship; and we now tell you that we strictly observe to do it
 And now, brethren, I inform you that we will sit still here at our towns, Kakelellama-

 to be quickly communicated to you, and have forwarded them by express, as it was quite uncertain when a private opportunity might poking, Gnaddenhutten, and Tupickcong, upon the Muskingum, to hold fast that chain of friendship between you and us
 Brethren, you desired us that the road between us and you might be kept clear and open, that the traders might pass and repass sale, which we also have done, and we wish that it may continue further
 We desire, therefore, that vou will not suffer your foolish young people to lie on the road to watch and frighten our people, by pointing their guns at them when they come to trade with you; for some of our people have been so scared that they came home and alarmed our towns, HS if the white people would kill all the In- dians, whether they were friends or enemies
 (A string of white wampum
) Brethren of Virginia, we now see you and the Shawanese in grips with each other, ready to strike; and we do not know what to say between you further; you will be the best judges yourselves of what is to follow, as we can do no more to reconcile you
 But in the struggle between you, when you have thrown down the Shawanese, brethren, we desire you to look no further, nor set down there, hut return to the Kenhawa or south side of the Ohio, the place that you then rise from; and when you have so concluded this dispute, brethren, we will expect to hear from you, that we may acquaint all other Nations of it, but hope that you will be strong, brethren, and renew the ancient friendship with all other Nations, when you have ended your dispute with these people
 (A string of black wampum
) [Intelligence received from Captain White Eyes:] On my return to Newcomer's Town with the speeches you charged me with, I found that several parties of Shawanese had set out to war against you, contrary to their promise before to the Chiefs of the Delawares, who desired me to return and inform you of it, as it would be to no purpose to treat further with them upon friendly terms, but that they should be in- formed of your speeches; they came forwarded 0}' two of your people
 Brethren, we have now to acquaint you that the Shawanese are all gone from Wagetomica to assemble themselves at the Lower Towns; if there was one yet remaining we would tell you
 But as this is not the case, and some of our people may he yet on their way up from amongst them, we would have you consider and cross to them from the mouth of the Hig Ken- hawa, as our women and children may now be frightened when you come near them, and the Shawane;e are all gone
 Brethren, one of the Shawanese that has beaded a party against you, has sent us word that he was going to strike you, and when he had done it, he would then blaze a road from the place he would do the mischief to New- comer's Town, by which he would sen whether the peace was so strong be- tween the whites and the Dulawares as they pretended
 Keesnateta has likewise sent us word that he now saw his grandfathers, the Delawares, had thrown them away, for which reason they were now rising to go away, though, he said, he was sure no other Nation had done it; and that it hud been an ancient custom with their Nation, that when they left any place in

 333 offer
 All prospect of accommodation with the Shawanese and Vir- ginians is certainly over for some time, but yet it does not appear they have any hostile intentions against this Province
 The en- gaging the service of the Delawares to protect our frontiers would undoubtedly be good policy, if it did not cost too dear
 I am afraid, however, they will be very craving, but as they have offered it, it should not be altogether overlooked
 At the same time their friend- ship should be secured on as easy terms as possible
 I doubt, with the utmost prudence that can be exerted, but these Indian disturbances will occasion a very heavy expense to the Province
 The necessity of establishing some place of security for the trade (if it is considered as advisable to carry it on at all), is in- the manner they wore doing, whoever remained behind them, they always turned about und struck them
 Brethren, the day we got into Newcomer's Town a party was discovered, whose intentions were to come to Fort Pitt to put Colonel Croghan and Alexander McKee, with Guyssutha, to death, and also waylay us, which we passed; as by killing us, they say, no more news will be carried between the white people and the Indians
 I could inform you of a great deal more, but these are the most material occurrences and facts, which you may depend upon
 lVIy brother is lately come from the Wabash Indians-, who told him they would expect to hear the truths of the accounts from that quarter un his re- turn; and I have sent a message by him to them, desiring them not to listen to the Shawanese, who would only endeavor to draw them into troubles and leave them by themselves, which had been their constant practice
 [Mr
 Croghan addressed Captain White Eyes ns his particular friend
] Brother, I now speak to you as a friend to both parties, your Nation and the English, and not by any particular authority, and I am convinced from the speeches you have now delivered, that your Nation has the sincerest in- tentions of preserving entire that friendship subsisting between you and us; and I observe from your intelligence that the Shawanese are withdrawn from one of their towns in your neighborhood, which is an evident proof that they do not mean to be friends with you or us; therefore, brothers, I would have you consider well whether you would not in the present cir- cumstance think it prudent for some of your people to accompany ours when they go to chastise the Shawanese, in order to enable them to make a proper distinction between our friends and our enemies
 [Captain White Eyes' answer to Colonel Croghan:] I am glnd to hear you, and I will consider what you have said, but cannot immediately return you an answer
 I will send your message to our Chiefs at Kaskaskia, and as soon as I have their sentiments and advice will speak to you, which I expect in two days; in the meantime, you may be assured that their sentiments will not deviate from that strict friendship subsisting between us

 creasing daily
 A small parcel of goods which Mr
 Spear has sent to one of the Delaware towns has enraged the commandant at Pitts- burgh to an exceeding degree, and he threatens "the persons who carried them shall be tried for their lives on their return
" I men- tioned the Kittanning; it is certainly a proper place, both on account of some natural advantages of situation with regard to the interior part of the country, and that its being in one of your manors, the settlers would have an opportunity of procuring lots on easy terms; at the same time it would not be foreign to your interest
 I find, however, they—the traders at Pittsburgh—would wish to fix upon some place nearer that town, for which I can see no reason, unless they imagine the property they leave behind them will be more un- der their eye, or which, I think more probable, Mr
 Croghan directs them to some spot where he has a right, and which may serve his interest; for though I believe he is zealous in the service of the public at present, he will never lose sight of his own particular in- terest
 If they do remove, I will endeavor to persuade them to the Kittanning at once; but if they are unwilling, your ordering a town to be laid out there, and a small stockade to be built, will effectually determine them before they have gone far in another settlement
 Captain White Eyes and John Montaur are preparing a party to join the Virginian militia if they cross the river to attack the lower Shawanese; and I have been solicited to order some of the rangers to join them
 This I have positively refused, and have sent order, to the person intended, on no account whatever to attempt to pass either of the rivers
 So far from joining the Virginians, who have taken such pains to involve the country in war, it would, in my idea, be not improper that the Shawanese should know this Gov- ernment is at peace with them, and will continue so, provided they do not infringe it themselves, and that a boundary be given them, the doing mischief on the east side of which would be considered a declaration of war and bring all the weight of this Government upon them
 We begin to be impatient with respect to the rangers; their second month is just expiring, but whilst the country is in such commotion, and the harvest not yet got in, they can not be dismissed
 I have not the least fears about the expense, and the Association may safely depend on the generosity of the Government, more especially as they have such assurances from your Honor of your approbation of the measure, aml your assistance towards relieving them from the expense

 I am very little acquainted with Indian affairs, and I do not trust Mr

 GOVERNOR PESN TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, 6th August, 1774
 Sir:—I have received your letters of the 22d and 26th ulto
, inclosing several depositions and letters relative to the present sit- uation of affairs in Westmoreland
 As I find by all intelligence you have from time to time commu- nicated to me, that the Shawanese, as well as the Delawares, have discovered a strong aversion to entering into a war, either with Virginia or this Province, and, on the contrary, have given repeated proofs of their sincere disposition to live in peace and harmony with both, colonies, I have, with the advice of my council, thought it expedient to send messages to those tribes, expressing the great concern of this Government at the late unfortunate disturbances between them and some of His Majesty's subjects belonging to the Colony of Virginia, at the same time declaring our resolution to preserve the treaties of peace and friendship existing between us inviolate, and earnestly advising the Shawanese not to strike the people of Virginia, as they, as well as the people of this Province are all subjects of one and the same great King, who will be as much offended at any injury committed against any one part of his subjects as another, but to exert their best endeavors to settle the differences that have arisen between the Virginians and them, and to continue to live in friendship with all His Majestv's subjects
1 1The messages to the Shawanese and Delawares were in these words: [To THE SFTAWANESE

336 The StSt. Clair Papers
 AB to the proposal of engaging the services of the Delawares to protect our frontiers, I would only just observe that it is a matter chain of friendship which was made between our forefathers, and renewed by us, and you may be assured that I shall always remember this instance of your kindness, iind that I shall hold fast that end of the chain which is in my hands, so long as you hold yours
 But, brethren, it gives me great concern, and my heart is grieved to hear of the difference between you and our brothers, the people of Virginia
 If any of the wicked people of Virginia have murdered any of your people, you should complain of it to the Gov- ernor, and he will have them punished
 You should not, in such cases, take revenge upon innocent people who have never hurt you
 It is a very wicked thing to kill innocent people because some of their countrymen have been wicked and killed some of you
 "Brethren, if you continue to act in this manner, the people of Virginia must do the same thing by you, and then there will be nothing but war be- tween you
 Consider, brethren, that the people of Virginia are like the leaves upon the trees, very numerous, and you are but a few, and although you should kill ten of their people for one that they kill of yours, they will at last wear you out and destroy you
 They are able to send a grout army into your country, and destroy your towns, and "your corn, and either kill your wives and children or drive them away Besides, brethren, the Vir- ginians, as wel as our people and you, are children of the Great King who lives beyond the great water; and if his children fall out and go to war among themselves, and some of them are wicked, and will not make peace with the others, be will bo very angry, and punish tnose who are in fault
 Therefore, brethren, let me advise you to forget and to forgive what is past, and to send to the Governor of Virginia, and offer to make peace
 "I shall write to the Governor of Virginia, and endeavor to persuade him to join you in mending the chain of friendship between you, which has been broken, and to make it so strong that it may never be broken again; and I hope, brethren, if he be willing to do this good thing, that you will be of the same mind, and then we shall all live together like friends and brothers

 I was fearful that you would suffer your young men to take revenge \ipon our innocent people, but when I heard- that you had a good heart, and viewed these things in their proper light, and that you remembered the chain of friendship made by our forefathers, and would not take revenge upon us for what the Vir-

 337 in the present situation of Indian affairs too delicate for me to in- termeddle in
 Since my last letter to you, I have considered of what you men- tioned in a former letter, and now repeat, respecting the establish- ment of some place of security for carrying on the Indian trade, as you say that Pittsburgh will certainly be abandoned by all our people; and I am now to acquaint you that I approve of the meas- ure of laying out a town in the proprietary manor of Kittanning, to accommodate the traders and the other inhabitants who may choose to reside there; and, therefore, inclose you an order for that purpose
 But I can not, without the concurrence of the Assemblv, give any directions for erecting a stockade or any other work for the security of the place which may incur an expense to the Province
 With respect to the continuance of the two hundred rangers in the service, it must altogether depend upon the intelligence we re- ginians or some of our foolish young men had done, it gave me the greatest satisfaction, and made my mind easy
 "Brethren, you may depend that so long as you are inclined to peace and friendship you shall find mo in the same mind, for why should we full out and go to murdering one another for what our foolish young people do, and what neither of us approve of? In such cases, let us endeavor to find out such foolish young me and punish them for their wickedness
 I have offered a reward of fifty pounds apiece for those two wicked people, who, it is said, murdered Joseph AVipey, and, if they can be taken, I shall do every thing in, my power to huve them punished
 "I am very sorry to hear that your grandchildren, the Shawanese, have a difference with our brothers, the Virginians, and I wis-h I could make them friends
 I shall write to the Governor of Virginia, and recommend it to him to endeavor to make peace with them; and I would advise you to go to the Shawaneso, and persuade them to forget every thing that is past, and make up nil their differences with the people of Virginia, so that we may all live together in peace and quietness, like friends and brothers, for what can they get by being a war with one another? whoever of them gets the best, both will bo very much hurt
 "Brethren, l live a great way from you, and have a great deal of busi- ness to do with my people at home, otherwise I would go to see you, and shake hands with you, and smoke a pipe with you under the tree of peace, as we and our forefathers used to do
 By all means, brethren, be strong, and keep fast hold of one end of the covenant chain, and you may be as- sured I will keep fast hold of the other, and when any of our people are so wicked as to kill any of yours, or do you any harm, let me know it, and I will do every thing in my poweC to have justice done

 ceive of the situation of our affairs with the Indians
 At present I think it very improper to discharge them; and it is not improbable that if the commotions between the Virginians and the Indians should not soon be at an end, it may be necessary to keep them on foot for the protection of our people till the meeting of the Assem- bly on the 19th of September
 I herewith send to your care the messages above mentioned, with a belt of wampum accompanying each, and desire you will engage some trusty, intelligent person to carry them, and interpret the messages to the Indians
 A young man of the name of Elliot, who has been trading at the Shawauese towns, and lately came from thence, has offered his services to carry any messages from Govern- ment to the Indians, and may probably be a very proper person to employ on this occasion
 He was to leave this place yesterday, on his return to Westmoreland
 I should be glad to have his deposition taken as to what he knows respecting the late disturbances between the Virginians and the Indians, from the beginning of them
 You hint something in your last letter about making presents to the Indians, but though such a step at some future convenient time might be useful and proper, I am of opinion it would be very unad- visable under the present circumstances
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, August 8, 1774 Sir:—I am just returned from Pittsburgh, where the Pipe, Guyasutha, and the White JMingo are arrived, and bring favorable accounts from the Indian Nations about the lakes
 They say they are all disposed to continue in friendship with the English; but the Wyandotts, the Hurons, and the Ta\vas have been waivering
 The Shawanese had applied to them, and it was so long that they heard nothing from our people, that they were inclined to assist them, but these chiefs have persuaded them to sit still, and to send to the Wabash Indians to be quiet likewise; so that it is probable they arrived amongst them in a favorable time
 Some deputies from the Six Nations are also arrived
 They have brought a very large belt to Mr
 Croghan and Mr
 McKee, inform- ing them of the death of Sir William Johnson, and of their inten- tions, notwithstanding, to adhere firmly to the treaties subsisting betwixt the English and them, and to endeavor to retain the other Nations in peace
 They also have sent a belt by these deputies to
Page 339

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 339 ihe Dela wares, and to the Wabash Confederacy, recommending it to them to remain in peace, and to inform them that though their great friend is dead, the council-fire kindled by the English and them continues to burn as bright as ever; such is their mode of ex- pression
 From these circumstances it is to be hoped that the fracas with the Shawanese will blow over without any very bad conse- quences, though that depends upon others, which must be brought about in a very little time, as five hundred of the Virginians are marched to destroy Wakatomica, the town the Shawanese lately abandoned
1 Should these meet with any check, which is not improbable, some of the Western Nations will certainly join them; but if they re- turn without, and are satisfied with destroying that town, matters may probably be made up; but I doubt they will not stop there, as you see by the inclosed copy of a letter from Lord Dunmore to Mr
 Conolly, which accidentally fell into my hands, that his Lordship is very full of chastising them; and the twenty-fifth of next mouth is fixed for attacking the great Shawanese town on the Scioto
 Your Honor will please to take notice, that the hint I gave you before of a design to interrupt the trade of this Province, however improbable it might appear, was not without some'foundation
 Mr
 Hanna returned from Philadelphia yesterday, and gives an account that the Assembly have provided for the men that were raised for the defense of this county to the tenth instant, or longer if necessary, and that he himself is appointed Senior Captain, ab initio, Mr
 Caret the next, and a number of others who have never served an hour
 The last part of his intelligence I gave no credit 1In July, 1774, Major Angus McDonald arrived over the mountains, with a considerable force of Virginia militia, which, when embodied with those already raised in the West, amounted to seven hundred men
 Ale- Donald went down to Wheeling, in order to take command, as there the whole force rendezvoused
 A stockade fort (Fort Fincastlo) was erected under the joint directions of Major McDonald and Captain William Craw- ford
 On the twenty-sixth of July, about four hundred men, having left Wheel- ing, arrived at the mouth of Fish Creek, on the east side of the Ohio, twenty- four miles below
 Hero they determined to move against the Shuwaneso villages upon the Muskingum River, in what is now Muskingum qounty, Ohio
 The men were led by Major McDonald
 Captain Crawford re- mained at Fort Fincastle
 The expedition proved successful
 Wakatomica, near what is now Dresden, Ohio, and other Shawaneso towns, were destroyed, 
and considerable plunder secured
 This was the first effective blow struck ty Virginia troops in Lord Dunmore's War

 to, as he has no commission, nor any letters from any person about Government; and I do imagine, that as the command of them had been originally committed to me, without giving me some intima- tion of it
 Nor is it reasonable that these men should take rank of the officers who have, in former wars, faithfully, as I am told, served this Government
 Trifling as this affair is, it is likely to create much uneasiness; but I am certain your Honor will not al- low those who have done no service, to rob those who have, of their just reward; besides, the Association is bound to pay those they employed
 I must own I have been remiss in not fully informing your Honor who they were; but I beg you to reflect upon the severe sickness I have just passed through
 Some of them, had there been the least prospect of its being a permanent affair, I should not have recommended to you; but we were under the necessity of employing such people as had influence amongst the mob and could get the men; and you will please to consider that it is by such acts that they must still be managed, as there are no laws by which obedience or discipline can be enforced
 I have told Mr
 Hanna peremptorily, that I should retain the direction of the troops till I had your orders to the contrary; and I fondly hope this explanation will not disoblige you
 Notwithstanding what I said to Mr
 Smith on the subject of join- ing the Virginians, he thought proper to join a small party of Dela- wares and Mingoes, with eight meu, in the character of volunteers, and proceeded to Wheeling
 The Virginia detachment had marched two days before they arrived; and Captain Crawford, who com- mands them (the President of our Court), told him it would fatigue them too much to overtake the party, and that they had better re- turn, which accordingly they did; and by what I learn from him, they seemed equally jealous both of him and the Indians
 I can recollect nothing else at present, and your Honor may prop- ably think I might have spared a great part of what is already written
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, August 25<A, 1774
 Sir:—Agreeable to your request, I now enclose you the deposi- tions of some of the inhabitants of Pittsburgh, respecting the treat- ment they have met with from the Virginian officers

 341 the persons who saw the Shawanese after they had been fired upon on their return, are now there, so that I would not inquire into that circumstance
 The message to the Delawares, with the belt of wampum, I de- livered to some of their principal chiefs, at Mr
 Croghan's, on Sun- day last
 Mr
 Croghan and Mr
 McKee were of opinion it would, perhaps, be taken ill by the Six Nations that they were not in- cluded
 I therefore took the liberty to add them in the address to the message, and had a fair copy made out and given to them with a belt
 They were received seemingly with great satisfaction by both, and they declared the firmest purposes of remaining in peace themselves, and restoring it between the people of Virginia and the Shawanese
 At the same time I acquainted them with your orders for erecting a trading place at the Kittanning, for which they are very thankful, as they are in want of many things already, and can not come to Pittsburgh and purchase; and a number of them will probably be there on Monday next, which is the time I have ap- pointed for laying out the town
 Mr
 Spear and Mr
 Butler set out this day with their goods and other effects
 Instead of sending the message to the Shawanese by a white man, I procured the Pipe, a faithful and sensible Delaware chief, to go and acquaint them with the message his nation had received from your Honor; that you had recommended it to them to speak to the Shawanese not to strike the Virginians, and that he had seen a mes- sage and belt for them, which, if they were well disposed, some of their people might come and receive it at Appleby
 I thought this the most advisable way, as the people at the fort are extremely jeal- ous of any person going amongst them, and had threatened the young man you mention to go with them; and some proposals of accommodation, I understand, have been made them by Mr
 Con- oily, to which, if they should not listen, they would be very apt to allege it was owing to their hearing from this Province
 It is impossible to tell what will be the consequence of the Vir- ginia operations
 I still hope they will not be able to bring on a war
 I think Lord Dunmore must soon see the necessity of peaceSt. Clair, ^Eneas Mackay, William Amberson, John Shannon, Richard Butler, and George Ashton
 They recount the annoyances they and others had suffered because of Conolly's oppressive acts—such as pressing of horses from their owners, threatening to send various parties in irons to Virginia, searching houses, assaults upon Pennsylvanians, killing of sheep and hogs, 
and taking other property, confinenent of citizens in Fort Dunmore, and •other outrages

 The season is now far advanced, and the country is exhausted of provisions
 Should another body of men be drawn together, they could not be supported; and I believe their last exploit has not given them much stomach for another
 There was, indeed, such confusion amongst the troops, and dissension amongst the officers, that had they met with any number of the enemy, they must cer- tainly have been cut off
 Preparations, however, are making, and his Lordship is hourly expected
 The 10th of August, which was the time your Honor fixed for keeping up the rangers, was passed before your letter reached me; but as you were pleased to say their standing till the 19th of Septeml>cr would depend upon that intelli- gence you might receive from Captain Thomson and myself, we thought it best to continue them, being both of opinion that, at this time, it was very necessary, it being, in some measure, the crisis of the dispute with the Shawauese; and that great numbers of people are now gone down to bring back their families, which they removed when they thought themselves in more immediate danger
 I am sorry I troubled your Honor with my foolish grievances
 I hope I shall always feel the spirit of the station I may be called to act in; but particular circumstances, I believe, had, in that case, set it rather too much on edge
 I will not often offend in the same manner
 I must do Mr
 Caret the justice to say he is a very good man, and would fill that or most other places with reputation
 An express arrived a day or two ago from Detroit
 Mr
 Conolly had applied to the commanding officer at that post to stop the trade with the Shawauese; but this he refuses, both as they have no pros- pect of war, and that for such a step he must have the orders of the Commander-in-Chief at least
 He says all the Indians in that coun- try seem to be peaceably disposed
 A letter by the same messenger, from a merchant at Detroit to a merchant at Pittsburgh, gives a quite contradictory account of matters; says the Indians in that country will all join the Shawanese; that some of them have come in from the frontiers of Virginia, and have brought scalps; that the general rendezvous is appointed on the Wabash, and that they ex- pect but a very short time to have any intercourse with them, and desires him to write to Simons, at Lancaster, not to send the goods he had ordered
 This moment I have heard from Pittsburgh that Mr
 Spear's and Mr
 Butler's goods, that were going to Appleby, are seized by Mr
 Conolly's orders; and that Mr
 Butler, with three young men, his assistants, are in confinement in the common guard-house; and that a •woman who kept house for Mr
 Butler has been drummed all around the-

 This is a degree of tyranny and oppression beyond every thing that has yet happened
 I shall be able to give you a more circumstantial account to-morrow, when Captain Thomson will be here, who, I un- derstand, was present when it happened
 It will oblige me to put off my journey to Appleby, as all my stores, provisions, etc
, were with Mr
 Butler's goods
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENS
 LIGONIER, August 27, 1774
 Sir:—The very extraordinary news from Fort Pitt, that I men- tioned in my letter of the 25th, proves too true
 Captain Thomson was there, and informs me that Mr
 Butler was not only made a prisoner, but treated with every instance of insult and abuse
 The crime it seems they are charged with, is a suspicion of trad- ing with the enemy Indians; but for this there can not be the Icast foundation, as their destination was no secret, and I had given pub- lic notice, in writing, of the design of laying out a town up the river, and the time when
 It seems this is the act of Captain Aston, Conolly being gone to meet Lord Dunmore; but, in truth, it is the act of Mr
 Campbell, who is their Counsel-General, and whose plan the removing any of the trade from Pittsburgh broke in upon
 Captain Thomson offered any security they pleased to demand, but they would accept of none, and for some time would not permit any of their acquaintance to visit them, and jostled Mr
 Smith and Mr
 Mackay out of the fort in the most insulting manner imaginable
 The treatment these people have met with, for a length of time, has been sufficient to break their spirit; but it has not succeeded, and those at that place, who are friends of this Province, will meet me at Appleby to-morrow, and are making up another cargo, that they may have something to keep the Indians easy that will be there
 MACKAY TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PITTSBURGH, 4th Sept
, 1774
 My Dear Sir:—On my return to this place, last Friday evening, I received the disagreeable information of two friendly Delaware In- dians being massacred on their way from this place to Mr
 Croghan's, in cool blood, by notorious villians that premeditated the matter be- fore hand, and stationed themselves behind brush near the road-

 side upon the occasion
 It is impossible to discover the murderers at this time, and much more so to bring them to condign punishment, because they have all the force and power the place can afford in their favor, but there is strong presumption for pointing out the per- petrators by name
 Happily for this place, about an hour after the murder was com- mitted, Lieut
-Colonel Angus McDonald,1 of Virginia, arrived here, with a small party escorting stores for the intended expedition against the Shawauese, and was greatly exasperated at the authors of that cruel murder, and exerted himself both as an honest man and a man of experience and judgment, in order to repair the dam- age done to our friendly Indians, and promised them further satis- faction on my Lord Dunmore's arrival here, who is expected hera in a few days
 Colonel McDonald has no other business to detain him here at this time, but his own humane disposition to protect both the friendly Indians and the unhappy inhabitants of this place from the insults of the militia, so long the oppressors of this quarter, now under the command of George Aston, and I may say Walter Gra- ham, two of the greatest miscreants that ever drew the breath of life, except the black gang that are influenced by their example and counsel
 Because Col
 McDonald signifies his disapprobation of their hellish plots and conduct, he is hourly insulted and threat- ened by them, as well as we are, although their superiors in every degree
 Matters must soon come to a crisis, for, notwithstanding the repeated acts of tyranny we have already experienced, what we now feel far surpasses all
 We dare not venture to enjoy the comfort of peaceable rest or sleep at night for fear of our houses being broke open about our ears, and our persons maltreated
 As to poor Mr
 Butler, he looks upon himself in hourly danger of his life, although still confined in their common guard-house, and Col
 McDonald is greatly distressed that it is entirely out of his power to render him the least relief, for they will obey no orders from him, and the very advertisements he put up on the gates of the fort, offering £50 reward to any person that would discover the murderers of the Indians, although given in charge by himself to the officers then upon guard, and also to the sentries then upon duty, these advertisements were pulled off and destroyed in the same night
 I am greatly concerned to hear that Mrs
 StSt. Clair is so indisposed
 I hope by this time she found relief, which, I pray God, may be the 1 It would soem by this that McDonald had been promoted from major to i lieutenant-colonel, after his arrival in the West

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH SHIPPEN, JR
 LIGONIER, October 17, 1774
 Sir:—Having accidentally met with my friend, Mr
 MacKay, at this place, I take the liberty to introduce him to you
 He has an answer to the messages the Governor sent to the Shawanese and Delawares not unfriendly, but which you will very well under- stand
1 Mr
 MacKay is one of the magistrates that was sent to Virginia
 He is a warm friend to this Government, and has some idea of his own importance
 I wish you would please to introduce him to the Governor, and let him tell his story
 I need not tell you how far a little attention will go with people of a certain char- acter; but this you may depend on, he is an upright, honest man
 Excuse my mentioning it, but these gentlemen's expenses on that Virginia trip should certainly be paid them
 I know, however, he will not mention it, nor would he forgive me if he knew that I had done it
 I don't know how it is, but I am very apt to get into mat- ters I have no sort of business with, and which, indeed, does not become me
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 HANNA'S TOWN, November 2, 1774
 Dear Sir:—A hasty opportunity just offers whilst we are in an adjourned court, and as the person is returning, I will beg the favor that you will send us the last taxation and insolvent acts, neither of which we have, and have occasion for at this present juncture, and our board can not do business without the taxation act
 We have no news of Lord Dunmore that can be depended on, since his departure from Hockhocking for the Shawanese town; but a report prevails that Colonel Lewis has been attacked at the mouth of the Kenawha, and had one hundred and twenty men killed and wounded, notwithstanding which he got the better of the Indians
2 1The answer hore mentioned has not been found

 Here he remained some time, to gut in order as many men as possi-

346 The StSt. Clair Papers
 I hope I shall soon be able to send you some authentic intelligence- of the operations ot the Virginia troops, and request you will ex- ble for service agamst the savages
 Such as were raised in the counties of Frederick, Berkeley, and Dunmore, were put under command of Adam Stephen as Colonel
 About the end of August, they marched for Pittsburgh, uccompanied by his Lordship
 In September, while Dunmore was in the last mentioned place, he succeeded in getting together a few individuals of the different nations of Indians living beyond the Ohio River, to hold a treaty with them
 They promised to meet him at the mouth of the Hock- hocking River to make peace
 Captain William Crawford hud returned home from building the fort at AVheeling, and having received a Major's commission, again moved down the Ohio, this time at the head of five hun- dred men
 He marched by land, while Lord Dunmore, with seven hundred men, floated down the river
 The army reached Wheeling, September 30th, and Crawford was dispatched with his detachment of five hundred to erect a stockade at the mouth of the Hockhocking—Dunmoro arriving with the residue of the army in time to take part in its construction
 Mean- while, Colonel Lewis, with the southern division of the army, was moving down the Great Kanawha
 It had been determined by his Lordship to have that officer, on his arrival upon the Ohio, move up stream and join him at the mouth of the Hockhocking
 The savages who, at Tort Pitt, promised to meet Dunmore down the Ohio, with additional members of their respective tribes, failed to arrive
 Only two chiefs made their appearance, and both these were Delawares
 But that nation, it was well understood, was not hostile; so no treaty could be made with the enemy
 At this time, Dunmore was ignorant as to whether Lewis had reached the Ohio or not, a message sent by him having arrived at the mouth of the Great Kanawha in advance of that officer
 Another express was thereupon dispatched, which, on the eighth of October, found him at Point Pleasant (the mouth of the Great Kanawha), where he arrived two days previous
 But it was impossible for him to move up the Ohio to meet Dunmore, on ac- count of the non-arrival of supplies and ammunition, and of a portion of his troops
 Meanwhile, scouts had been sent to Dunmore by him, who re- turned on the thirteenth, with an order from his Lordship to march directly toward the Shawanese towns on the Scioto, and join him at a certain point on the way
 Governor Dunmore now put his division in motion for the same destination
 On his way to the Indian villages, he was overtaken by a courier from Lewis, acquainting him with the hard-fought battle of the tenth of October, at Point Pleasant, where his army contended all day long with a large force of Shawanese and other savages, only to claim the victory at nightfall, after a
 severe loss in killed and wounded
 On the seventeenth, Lewis crossed the Ohio, and took up his line- of march for the Scioto, to join Dunmore
 His Lordship was met, before he reached the Indian villages, with a depu- tation from the enemy, anxious for an accommodation; for a peace bad al- ready been conquered by the Virginians, at a sacrifice of many valuable lives, in the battle at Point Pleasant
 So the Governor found little difficulty in arranging for a treaty
 But the arrival of Lewis and his gallant troops,

1 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIGONIER, December 4th, 1774
 Sir:—The war betwixt the Indians and Virginians is at last over
 I promised myself the pleasure of giving your Honor the earliest account of its issue, but I have not yet been able to get at a true state of the Treaty of Peace; a peace, however, is certainly made with the Shawanese, one condition of which is the return of all property and prisoners taken from the white people, and for the performance of it they have given six hostages
2 The Mingoes that live upon Scioto did not appear-to treat, and a party was sent to destroy their towns, which was effected, and there are twelve of them fresh from the red field of conflict, breathing revenge against the savages, was an element difficult to control
 However, no order of Dunmore was intentionally disobeyed by Lewis, who was commanded to return to Point Pleasant
 A peace was negotiated by Dunmore with the Shawanese, which put an end to the war
—Butterfields Washington-Crnwford Letters, p
 96-99
 1This was dated October 12, 1774, and was intended to counteract the ef- fect of one issued by Lord Dunmore, at Pittsburgh, September 17th
 (See letter from StSt. Clair to Penn, December 4, 1774, post
) It required all per- sons west of the Laurel Hill to retain the settlements made under the Pro- vince of Pennsylvania, and to pay due obedience to the laws of that Gov- ernment; also, all magistrates and other officers were to proceed as usual in the administration of justice, etc
 2 The treaty wus entered into at what was called "Camp Charlotte," in what is now Pickaway county, Ohio, whither Lord Dunmore had marched his army from the mouth of the Hockhocking
 The Shawanese villages were in the immediate vicinity
 The terms of the agreement were these: The Shawanese were to give up all the prisoners in their possession ever taken by them in that and previous wars with the white people; also, all negroes and all the horses stolen or taken by them since the war of 1763
 No Indian, for the future, was to hunt on the east side of the Ohio, nor any white man on the west side, as it was acknowledged that it had been the cause of disturbances
 As a guarantee that the Shawanese would perform their part of the agreement, they gave up four of their chief men to be kept as hostages, who were to be relieved yearly, or as they might choose

 now prisoners in Fort Pitt
1 It is probable, from these circumstances, we shall have no more trouble with them, and things have come to 1 The Mingoes did not like the terms agreed upon between Lord Dunmore and the Shawanese, though their chief, Logan, sent in his acquiescence in his world-renowned speech
 But his clan determined to run away, and thus avoid giving their assent to the agreement
 "What happened them is best related by one who took patt in pursuing them: "The Shawanese have complied with the terms [of the treaty], but the Mingoes did not like the conditions, and had a mind to deceive us; but Lord Dunmore discovered their intentions, which were to slip off while we were settling matters with the Shawanese
 The Mingoes intended to go to the lakes [Lake Erie], and take their prisoners with them and their horses which they had stolen
 "Lord Dunmore ordered myself, with two hundred and forty men, to set out in the night
 We were to march to a town about forty miles distant from our camp, up the Scioto, where we understood the whole of the Alin- goes were to rendezvous upon the following day, in order to pursue their journey
 
 
 
 "Because of the number of Indians in our camp, we marched out of it, under pretense of going to Hockhocking [where Fort Gower had been erected] for more provisions
 Few knew of our setting off anyhow, and none knew where we were going to until the next day
 Our march was performed with as much speed as possible
 We arrived at a town called the Salt-Lick Town [within the present limits of Franklin county, Ohio], the ensuing night, and at daybreak we got around it with one-half our force, and the remainder were sent to a small village half a mile distant
 Unfortu- nately, one of our men was discovered by an Indian, who lay out from the town some distance by a log, which the man was creeping up to
 This obliged the man to kill the Indian
 This happened before daylight, which Jid us much damage, as the chief part of the Indians made their escape in the dark; but we got fourteen prisoners, and killed six of the enemy, wound- ing several more
 We got all their baggage and horses, ten of their guns, and two white prisoners
 The plunder sold for two hundred pounds sterling, besides what was returned to a Mohawk Indian that was there
 The whole of the Mingoes were ready to start, and were to have set cut the morning we attacked them
 Lord Dunmore has eleven prisoners and has returned the rest to the nation
 The residue are to be returned upon compliance with his Lordship's demands
"—Major William Crawford to Washington, in the "Washington-Crawford Letters," p
 54-56
 The destruction of the Salt-Lick Town, by Major Crawford, was the only actual fighting done by that part of the army which was under the com- mand of Lord Dunmore in person
 It was the last fighting done by Craw- ford until the Revolutionary War came on, in which he took an active part; but, in leading a force from Western Pennsylvania and North-western Vir- ginia, in 1782, against the hostile Wyandots upon the Sandusky river, he was taken prisoner and tortured to death by the Delawares, within the present limits of Wyandot county, Ohio

 349 a much better end than there was any reason to have expected
 But our troubles here are not yet over
 The magistrates appointed by Lord Dunmore, in this country, seem determined to enforce the jurisdiction of Virginia, and have begun with arresting one of your Honor's officers
 The 12th of November, Mr
 Conolly sent a warrant for Mr
 Scott to appear before him, or the next justice, to answer for a number of offenses committed by him under a pretended authority from Pennsylvania
 The warrant Mr
 Scott did not choose to pay any regard to, and the same evening a number of armed men came to his house to take him by force to Fort Burd
1 There he found Lord Dunmore, Mr
 Campbell, and Mr
 Penticost, ready to sit in judg- ment upon him
 Much passed amongst them, but the event was that he was obliged to enter into recognizance, with two sureties, to appear at the next court, to be held at Pittsburgh, for the county of Augusta,' on the 20th day of December, if the court should happen to be held there that day, or at any further day, when the court should be held there, to answer for having acted as a magis- trate of Pennsylvania, contrary to Lord Dunmore's proclamation,2 or Tort Burd, it will be remembered, was at Redstone, now Brownsville, Pennsylvania
 2 Lord Dunmore's proclamation was, in effect, that the rapid settlement mado to the westward of the Allegheny Mountains by His Majesty's sub- jects within the course of a few years had become nn object of real concern to His Majesty's interests in that quarter; that the Province of Pennsyl- vania had unduly laid claim to a very valuable and extensive quantity of His Majesty's territory, and the executive part of that Government, in con- sequence thereof, had most arbitrarily and unwarrantably proceeded to abuse the laudable adventures in that part of His Majesty's dominions, by many oppressive and illegal measures in discharging of their imaginary authority, and that the ancient claim laid to that country by the Colony of Virginia, founded in reason upon pre-occupying, and the general acquiescence of all persons, together with the instructions he had lately received from His Maj- esty's servants, ordering him to take that country under his administration; and as the evident injustice manifestly offered to His Majesty, by the immod- erate strides taken by the Proprietors of Pennsylvania, in prosecution of the wild claim to that country, demanded an immediate remedy, he did thereby, in His Majesty's name, require and command all of His Majesty's subjects west of the Laurel Hill to pay a due respect to his said proclamation, thereby strictly prohibiting the execution of any act of authority on behalf of the Province of Pennsylvania, nt their peril, in that country
 A counter proc- lamation was issued by Governor Penn, October 12,1774

 be committed to jail
 He chose the recognizance, the circumstances of his family and health rendering the other very inconvenient
 There is no doubt that the recognizance is in itself a mere nul- lity, but, after what has been done already, it is hard to say what may not be attempted, and it is very certain the people Lord Dunmore has clothed with authority pay little regard to the rules of law or the dictates of reason
 It would be exceedingly satis- factory if your Honor would please to give us directions for our conduct, and this case of Mr
 Scott requires it particularly
 I have wrote to Mr
 Wilson,1 of Carlisle, for his advice, fearing it would be impossible to know your mind in proper time, and for the nec- essary legal steps
 I believe he may be depended on, but it is very doubtful if his answer can arrive before the time they have appointed for their court; at any rate, we must endeavor to prevent a trial until you can have an opportunity of writing, if it should be by re- moving the indictment to Williamsburgh
 I account it a fortunate circumstance that they began with Mr
 Scott, who, with a great deal of firmness, possesses a good share of natural understanding
 In the course of an examination, which continued near two hours, he told Lord Dunmore that he had only one short answer to all his questions, which might save his Lordship a good deal of trouble, "that he acted under commission from your Honor and in obedience to your proclamation
" His Lordship was pleased to reply, that you had no right to give any such commission or authority to issue such proclamation
 Mr
 Scott told him that was a matter of which he was not a proper judge, and would abide by the consequences
 I am sorry to be obliged to give your Honor so much trouble on so very disagreeable a subject, but I hope the time is not far distant when it will be put to an end

 HANNASTOWN, Dec

 Sir:—Being this far on my way to Pittsburgh, I found a consta- ble from Virginia here who had made two men prisoners by virtue of a warrant from Major Smallman

 Mr
 Hanua had committed the constable, which I could not help approving of; but as there is some danger of his being rescued by force, I have advised the sending him to Bedford, or, at least, the sheriff should remove him to some other place pri- vately
 The Court, it is said, will certainly be held at Pittsburgh on the 20th
 I am personally threatened, but I promised Mr
 Scott to be there at that time, to give him some countenance, at least, if I can not give him assistance at his trial
 I had the honor to give you an account of his arrest a short time ago
1 Your Honor will judge from these circumstances what a shocking situation we are in; to add to the distress of which, the militia are plundering the people within the neighborhood of Pittsburgh of the very subsistence for their families
 I met with this opportunity of writing accidentally, and would not let it slip, as I thought it of consequence that you should be «arly acquainted with what is passing

 Our express is returned, and he says he gave the letters to Doctor Plunket, at Susquehannah, who would certainly send them
 Our situation, and that of the •well-affected inhabitants of this place, is become almost intolerable; it is impossible for any person to conceive the cruel mode of proceed- ings at this place, unless those who are unhappy to be eye-witnesses thereof

 Mr
 Smith was this day taken with a writ of one hundred thousand pounds damages
 But I need not descend into particulars; every part of their conduct appears that they not only want the jurisdiction of this quarter, but also to rob every man of his property
 Aud, gentlemen, it is by your friends here thought advisable that the sheriff, with a party of fifty men, or thereabouts, should come up aud take us who are in confinement, and also as many of these rascals as possible, as there will be no strength to oppose you, there being but eighteen men in Fort
 It is surprising what a pusillani- mous temper must prevail amongst the people in general to suffer the peace and welfare of a whole country to be destroyed by such a handful of villains
 But let the people be called upon by the sheriff, and certainly they will not refuse to come
 If such a step be thought best, it ought to be managed with secrecy and dispatch
 Pray send off the express by Tuesday night to us with advice, for if we are not taken off we must give bail, if it can be had, and the thoughts of so doing is no small mortification after hanging out so long

1 You see Hanua and he are very uneasy, which is really not to be wondered at, as they have been now upwards of three months in confinement, for paying obedience to his Honor's proclamation, and have not had a single line from any jx;rson about government, or any direction how to conduct themselves
 The Gov- ernor in these times must be occupied by objects of much greater 1See the previous letter—Cavet to StSt. Clair, May 13, 1775

 magnitnde; but I wish he could spare a few minutes for their affairs, which is truly a business of the last consequence to them, threatening them with no less than absolute ruin
 We have an account that Lord Dunmore has been obliged to abandon his government; it is the only piece of good news that has reached us since the disputes with Great Britain took so serious a turn; but I doubt the truth of it
 The Pittsburgh Court is now sitting; whether they do business or not, I have not heard
 The proposition for the relief of Cavet and Uunua, though I believe it practicable enough, I would do nothing in without the Governor's concurrence, as it might be attended with serious consequences
 Yesterday, we had a county meeting, and have come to resolu- tions to awe and discipline, and have formed an Association, which I suppose you will soon see in the papers
 God grant an end may be speedily put to any necessity for such proceedings
 I doubt their utility, and am almost as much afraid of success in this contest as of being vanquished
 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 LIOONIER, May 25, 1775
 Sir:—An express from Pittsburgh, with despatches for your Honor, having called here this morning, I embrace the opportunity to inform you that a commission is come up from Virginia to collect the Colony duty on all peltries exported from that place, and that notice has been given to the traders there to conduct them- selves accordingly
 I think they will find some way to evade pay- ing it, and those that are not yet come in will certainly carry them past
 'Tis a shocking thing that people should be obliged to such shift, and the trade of the Province be destroyed, by the obstinacy and caprice of one man
 I flatter myself, however, it will not be of long continuance
 Lord Dunmore's seizing the magazine has raised such a ferment that he will not probably visit the frontiers soon,1 and by the prorogation of his Assembly, the invasion law, under which it seems the garrison of the fort was kept up, will ex- pire; I think the ninth of next month is its period, and I am in- formed Couolly is preparing to decamp
 1 Before news arrived of the buttle of Lexington, Lord Dunmore Imd or- dered (April 21st) the powder belonging to Virginia to be token from the public store at Willinmsburg:, nnd placed on board nn armed vessel in the river
 This caused great excitement, which was increased by the news from Lexington

 355 We have nothing but masters and committees all over the coun- try, and every thing seems to be running into the wildest confusion
 If some conciliating plan is not adopted by the Congress, America has seen her golden days, they may return, but will be preceded by scenes of horror
 An association is formed in this county for defense of American hberty
 I got a clause added, by which they bind themselves to assist the civil magistrates in the execution of the laws they have been accustomed to be governed by
1 Hanna and Cavet are still pressing me to do something for their relief, and are very desirous they should be brought off by force; their project was, that writs should be issued against them, and that the sheriff should take a posse with him and bring them away, and make prisoners at the same time of their persecutors
 I believe 'tis very practicable, but I gave them to know that without positive di- rections from your Honor I would advise no such step, and that I thought you would not direct any that might have a tendency to embroil the Provinces
 However, it is no wonder that they are un- easy; they have been long confined, and must have suffered consid- erably by it
 Lord Dunmore has issued a proclamation, disclaiming the pro- ceedings of the surveyors in taking entries of lands, and ordering them to return the money received for them, but has spared their names; but I have seen none of them; they were spirited away, it seems, as fast as they appeared
 If the Fort should be evacuated next month, prav, sir, would it be proper to endeavor to get possession of it, or to raze it? That may possibly be done by themselves
 Mr
 Conolly has sent oitt for some of the principal men of tho Indians to come and receive the prisoners, and the Pittsburgh com- mittee has petitioned the General Congress to hold a treaty with the Western tribes
 1This clause was the fourth one, and read as follows: "4fh
 That we do not wish or advise any innovations, but only that things may be restored to, and go on in the same way as before tho era of tin Stamp Act, when Boston grew great, and America was happy
 As a proo of this disposition, we will quietly submit to the laws by which wu huv been accustomed to be governed before that period, and will, in our several or associate capacities, be ready when called on to assist the civil magistrates to carry the same in execution

 It shows a conservative spirit, and an unwillingness to do any thing that might tend to anarchy or violations of just laws

 VALENTINE CRAWFORD TO GEORGE WASHINGTON
1 JACOB'S CREEK, June 24, 1775
 Dear Sir:—I am very sorry to inform you I received a letter from Mr
 Clevclaiul, of the seventh of June, wherein he seems to be in a good deal of distress
 Five of the servants have run away, and plagued him much
 They got to the Indian towns, but by the exertions of one Mr
 Duncan, a trader, he has got them again
 He has sent three of them up by a man he had hired, with a letter to my brother William or mvself, to sell them for you; but the man sold them himself somewhere about Wheeling, on his way up, and never brought them to us
 He got £20 Pennsylvania currency for them, and gave one year's credit
 This was very low, and he did not receive one shilling
 This was contrary to Cleveland's orders, as the latter wanted to raise some cash by the sale to purchase pro- visions
 I think it would be advisable, if the men they are sold so low to are not good, to take them from them, and sell them again
 But the man shall not be stopped for want of money, for I will furnish him, and will assist Mr
 Simpson in getting started as quick as possible with his canoe and provisions
 Mr
 Cleveland left some corn at Mr
 Simpson's when he went down, and I will get him some flour to load his canoe
 Mr
 Cleveland sunk a canoe going down, and lost five or six casks of corn and several other things
 James McCormick and Charles Morgan found a bag of clothes and several other things, a few days after, as they were going down tiie river
 They delivered them to Mr
 Cleveland again, as they knew they belonged to his company, by some papers they found in the bundle
' Cleveland does not mention of his getting any but the three servants he sent to be sold, but Mr
 Duncan told me yesterday, at Fort Dunmore, that he got the whole five who ran away
 Dr
 Craik's manager has had very bad luck; for, in the canoe that was sunk, he lost all his papers
 He was much at a loss to find his land, or at least, to find the corner trees; but I have sent him all the plats and junctions I had from the doctor; and lest a letter I have written to the latter should miscarry, you can inform him of that fact
 I hope to be down in Fairfax as soon as ever I reap my harvest, and will then settle all my accounts with you
 We have chosen committees out here, and are raising an inde- pendent company—regulating matters the best we can; but an nn- 1 The reason why this letter is here inserted, is given in a note to the next letter—StSt. Clair to Shippen, July 12, 1776

 357 happy confusion happened the other day
 The Pennsylvaniaus came to Fort Pitt with the sheriff and about twenty men, and took Major Conolly about midnight, and carried him as far as Ligonier, the very night before we were to have the talk with the Indians
1 Several of the Pennsvlvania traders, by the Indians' story, were endeavoring to put ill into their minds
 On Major Conolly being taken, the people of Chartier's came in a company and seized three of the Pennsylvania magistrates, who were concerned in taking off Conolly — George Wilson, Joseph Spear, and Deverenx Smith
 They were sent in an old leaky boat down to Fort Fincastle under guard
 Our court,2 however, had no hand in this
 It was done by a mob or get of Conolly's friends who live on Chartier's Creek
 The members of our committee wrote a very spirited letter to the gentlemen of the Pennsylvania committee, demanding Conolly back
 All signed it, and sent it with an express
 On its receipt, they immediately sent Major Conolly buck
 Things now seem to be a little moderated
 I believe the Indians want nothing but peace; but it seemed to alarm them verv much to hear our great man was stolen
 Indeed, it alarmed us all, as Major Conolly was the man that had transacted all the business with them before
 Xo other person was so able to settle business with them as he

* 1In the treaty mndo at
 "Camp CharlottP," in October, 1774, between Lord Dunmore and the Shawancsc, it was arranged that u supplemental treaty should be held in tho ensuing spring, at Pittsburgh
 His Lord-hip was to inform tho chiefs by a message when it would suit him to meet them there, to settle some minute mutters that could not well be attended to at the first meeting
 Trouble with the Colony put it out of the power of Dun- more to again visit Fort Pitt
 So Major Conolly was d' puted to take charge of a ft airs with tho Indians
 Only a few Delawares and Mingoes could be induced to attend upon his call
 While engaged in preparations to have a "talk" with the assembled chiefs, ho was arrested as above stated
 ! That ia, tho Courts of West Augusta—a Virginia Court held at "Fort Dun more,'' Pittsburgh—tho justices being appointed by thu Virginia Gov- ernment
 The records of this Court have been preserved
 In the fall of 1770, the District of 'West Augusta was separated from Augusta County, and three counties—Yohfgnnia, Monongaliu and Ohio—erected out of it
 The Court of West Augusta was continued as the Court of Yohogania, but the place of its meeting was removed from Pittsburgh

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH SHIPPEN, JR
 LIGONIER, July 12th, 1775
 Dear Sir:—In my last I gave you an account of the taking of Mr
 Conolly, and mentioned some of the consequences I appre- hended from it
1 They have since been disagreeable enough to Mr
 Smith, Mr
 Speare, and Colonel Wilson, who were immediately made prisoners by way of reprisal, and sent off in a flat to Wheel- ing, where they were detained till the news of Conolly's return, and in the mean time were exposed to every species of insult and abuse
 An attempt has since been made to carry off the sheriff, but miscarried, which probably saved us another visit at court, as they found we were provided for them, but I have certain informa- tion that process is in the hands of the Virginia sheriff against our sheriff and many of the magistrates, and the Committee at Pitts- burgh have resolved that Lord Dunmore's proclamation respecting the country west of Laurell Hill shall be complied with, so that we may expect fine work
 Whilst Connolly was at my house endeavoring to procure bail, I treated him with a good deal of civility, by which, with the help of a cheerful glass, I got at some of his designs
 He is immediately to go England with White Eyes and some other Delaware chiefs, to solicit for them a confirmation of the country which they now live in, great part of which is within the bounds of this Province, and Lord Dunmore is to back it with all his interest
 They arc to repre- sent to the King's ministers that they have received the Christian religion, have got notions of property, and in a great measure changed their way of life, and can not change their place of abode as they have heretofore done, and which they must again do if Pennsylvania is allowed to extend beyond the Ohio
 Ridiculous as this may appear, I thought proper to mention it, for though the Proprietary's rights can not be injured by any such proposal, it may raise difficulties in the way of a future purchase or further settle- ment of the Province
 Lord Dunmore has also some design on the Islands in Delaware, and he (Conolly) has been procuring all the information he could respecting them; if you please acquaint the Governor if you think it worth while
 1The letter referred to has not been found
 In its place is given the one preceding—Valentine Crawford to George Washington, June 24, 1775— covering, as to Conolly's arrest, the same ground, probably, as
 the missing one from StSt. Clair

 Heaven restore peace to this distracted country! WILLIAM SMITH TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 BEDFORD, Sept
 4th, 1775
 Dear Sir:—I have just seen yours of the 2d inst
 to my brother
 Copies of the caleulations by Mr
 Rittenhouse and myself, signed with our names, were sent to Virginia
 I wish I had known that they would have been of any use on the present occasion
1 But you know the line or parallel to Delaware, at five degrees distant, crosses the Ohio near the mouth of Charles Creek ,2 and inclndes Fort Pitt, near six miles—of this there can not be the least shadow of a doubt
 If the Virginia delegates choose to attend to this point, we shall en- able Mr
 Wilson to satisfy them at Philadelphia
 In the meantime, it is but just that the possession of Fort Pitt should continue where it wan before, viz
, under the government of Pennsylvania
 The Indians, I hope, will have no applications about land mat- ters made to them now
 This is not the time for such things
 I am sorry you have had such a bad look-out for foreign flour
 I wish it may fall in my way as I go down to hasten some
 God grant that the Indians may be persuaded to a strict nentrality, and may not Britons on either side ever employ Indians against Britons, or make them a sort of arbiters of our differences, if it be possible to avoid it
3 Mr
 [John] Ormsby contracted with Messrs
 Fisher, Carmick, and myself, in the year 1770, for some lands
 We have long since paid his order to Capt
 Little for every acre surveyed, agreeably to the contract, and he sent us down the conveyances as made to himself from the persons in whose name the lands were taken up, but when we sent him the conveyance he ought to make to us, he neglected executing it
 I inclose a copy for him to exe- cute, and I beg you will get it done, and take the acknowledgment, and send it carefully t:i my brother
 I hope Mr
 Ormsby will not decline fulfilling his contract, or force us to any disagreeable meas- ures
 We have paid the surveyor, and fulfilled our part in every respect

 THOMAS SMITH TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 BEDFORD, Sept
 Mi, 1775
 Dear Sir:—I am just favored with yours, and am sorry it is not in my power to comply with your request; but I have neither of the papers or calculations you mention
 I have just asked my brother (who is here), and he has none of them with him
 How far it might be expedient in one point of view for the Congress, YET to settle even temporary boundaries, might, perhaps, deserve some consideration
 If such a thing could be done with propriety, it would be of the greatest utility to the peaceable inhabitants in your county, and I have always thought, since the dispute began, that 't was set on foot by a designing tool, with a more insidious view than was at first generally imagined, viz
, m order to set the Colonies at variance with one another
 Could it be viewed in that light, it would at present have a greater tendency to a speedy settlement amoajrst the people ihemselvey of a temporary boundary, without the interposition of the Congress, than any other argument that could be used
 If they shall judge it proper to intermeddle in the mat- ter at all, and if the Virginia delegate lias a real intention of set- tling it in any reason, the Monongahela will be greatly in favor of the Virginia, even by Mr
 Hooper's map, which I have before mo, but which 1 van not venture to send up without his permission, and since he made that map, which is done by actual survey of the Mo- nongahela, he has got the camps of Delawares, by which it appears that Fort Pitt lies three or four miles farther oast than he has placed it
 By comparing his map and your and Eitteuhouse's lines, Fort Pitt is at least four and at most not much above six miles within this Province, as nearly as I c;;n recollect the distance you made it
 Mr
 Hooper may be considered as an undoubted authority on the side of Virginia
 I believe he is a gentleman of candor and veracity, and you know he was a warm and violent Crogkanite at the time when he made it
 I am going to the woods to-morrow morning
 I need not tell you that I write now in haste
 P
 S
 There is not ono barrel of flour in or about town, and Mr
 O'llara requests you would endeavor to supply yourselves, which he thinks you can now, after the rain, easily do

 361 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR PENN
 PITTSBURGH, September 15tfi, 1775
 Sir:—Curiosity led me to this place, to bo present at the treaty with the Indians, which was appointed for the 10th instant, and that I might have it in my power to give you the earliest notice if any thing happened that appeared necessary for you to be apprised of
 The treaty is not yet opened, as the Indians are not come in, but there are accounts of their being on their way, and well dis- posed
1 We have, however, been surprised with a manenver of the people of Virginia that may have a tendency to alter their dis- position
 About one hundred men marched here from Winchester, and took possession of the Fort on the llth, which has so much disturbed the delegates from the Congress that they have thoughts of removing to some other place to hold the treaty
 They did everv tiling in their power to prevent their coming to the Fort, but to no purpose
• This step has already, as might naturally be expected, served to exasperate the dispute between the inhabitants of the country, and entirely destroyed the prospect of a cessation of our grievances, from the salutary and conciliating advice of the dele- gates of the respective provinces, in their circular letter;3 and they arc so sensible that, if something is not soon done to prevent it, the dispute must end in open violence; that they have warmly recom- mended to the Congress, without loss of time to direct a temporary 1 Efforts were made, in 1775, to hold a treaty with tho Western Indians, at Pittsburgh
 It was proposed that the meeting should take place Septem- ber 10th
 To forward the movement, Capt
 James Wood was sent beyond the Ohio to various tribes, inviting them to Pittsburgh at that time
 The object was conciliation, and to obtain their nentrality
 The result to the 15th of September is detailed above
 2On the llth of September, Captain John Neville took possession of Fort Pitt, for the purpose, avowedly, it seems, to "cover and protect the border," in the event hostility should be brought on in the Western country with the Indians, at the instigation of the Uritish
 The fears expressed by StSt. Clair, and entertained by others, seem not to have been well founded
 Neville took no part in the boundary controversy
 2The continued collisions and disorder at Pittsburgh could not fail to at- tract the attention of all the patriotic citizens of the two States, and on the 25th of July, 177"I, the delegates in Congress united in n circular urging the people in the disputed region to mutual forbearance
 The circular had these words: "We recommend it to you that all bodies of armed men, kept up bv either party, be dismissed; and tha* all those on either side who are in confinement, or on bail, for taking part in the contest, be discharged

 line
1 It may be necessary, if that measure meets with your appro- bation, to furuish some of your delegates with the draughts and calculations respecting the western extent of the province
 I take the liberty to mention this, that, supposing agreeable to you, the proper officer may be directed to supply them; that the Congress may have it in their power to take the matter up, with a prospect of at least no disadvantage to the Province
 I am sensible, Sir, this is out of my way; but the regard I have for your interests', and the gratitude I feel for your favors, must plead my excuse, as they are my only motives
 1 Although Congress took no authoritative action to settle the boundary between the two States, mutual forbearance during the opening scenes of the Revolution had the effeet to allay the excitement concerning the conflict of jurisdiction, This continued until 1779, when proceeding) were com- menced which, finally, ended in an amicable arrangement and the comple- tion of the boundary line
 But an element of discord was already removed by the disappearance of Conolly from Pittsburgh
 On the 8th
 of June, 1775
 Lord Dun more abandoned his palace in \Villiamsburg
and took refuge on board a man-of-war
 On the 'Juth of July, Conolly left "Fort Dun- more," on n visit to his Lordship, already plotting in the interests of the mother country against the colonies
 He never returned; his rule was at an end, greatly to the relief of South-western Pennsylvania
 StSt. Clair, who had so ably championed the interests- of Pennsylvan a, was soon called to take pnrt upon a broader stage of action

THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR
 CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN STSt. Clair AND WASHINGTON, SUHUYLER, REED, WILSON, AND OTHERS
 RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT HANNASTOWN
 Word reached the inhabitants of the western part of Pennsyl- vania, in the second week of May, 1775, of what the patriots of Lexington and Concord had dared for liberty on the memorable 19th of April, and they met at Hannastowu, on the Kith, to take into consideration the alarming situation of the country
 The fol- lowing resolutions, drawn up by Arthur StSt. Clair, Esq
,1 were unani- mously adopted: Resolved, That the Parliament of Great Britain, by several late acts, have declared the inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay to be in rebellion, and the ministry, by endeavoring to enforce those acts, have attempted to reduce the said inhabitants to a more wretched state of slavery than ever before existed in any state or country
 Not content with violating their constitutional and chartered priv- ileges, they would strip them of the rights of humanity, exposing lives to the wanton and unpunishable sport of a licentious soldierv, and depriving them of the very means of subsistence
 Resolved, That there is no reason to doubt but that the same system of tyranny and oppression will (should it meet with success in Massachusetts Bay) be extended to other parts of America; it is therefore become the indispensable duty of every American, of every man who has any public virtue or love for his country, or any bowels for posterity, by every means which God has put in his power, to resist and oppose the execution of it; that for us we will be ready to oppose it with our lives and our fortunes
 And the better to en- able us to accomplish it, we will immediately form ourselves into a military body, to consist of companies to be made up out of the several townships under the following association, which is de- clared to be the Association of Westmoreland County: 1The conservative and temperate character of this declaration at Hunnas- town, to which no exception was taken by any person present on that occa- sion, was in harmony with the loyalty of the views StSt. Clair held nt that time
 These are more fully set forth in a letter written by him u year later to Lientenant-Colonel Allen

 Possessed with the most unshaken loyalty and fidelity to His Majesty, King George the Third, whom we acknowledge to be our lawful and rightful King, nud who we wish may long be the be- loved sovereign of a free and happy people throughout the whole British Empire: we declare to the world, that we do not mean by this Association to deviate from the loyalty which we hold it our Ixmndeu duty to observe; but, animated with the love of liberty, it is no less our duty to maintain- and defend our just rights (which, with sorrow, we have seen of late wantonly violated in many in- stances by wicked ministry and a corrupted Parliament) and trans- mit them entire to our posterity, for which we do agree and asso- ciate together: 1st
 To arm and form ourselves into a regiment or regiments, and choose officers to command us in such proportions as shall be thought necessary
 2d
 We will, with alacrity, endeavor to make ourselves masters of the manual exercise, and such evolutions as may be necessary to enable us to act in a body with concert; and to that end we will meet at such times and places as shall be appointed either for the companies or the regiments, by the officers commanding each when chosen
 3d
 That should our country be invaded by a foreign enemy, or should troops be sent from Great Britain to enforce the late arbi- trary acts of its Parliament,1 we will cheerfully submit to military discipline, and to the utmost of our power resist and oppose them, or either of them, and will coincide with any plan that may be formed for the defense of America in general, or Pennsylvania in particular
 4th
 That we do not desire any innovation, but only that things may be restored and go on in the same waj as before the era of the Stamp Act, when Boston grew great and America was happy
 As a proof of this disposition, we will quietly submit to the laws by which we have been accustomed to be governed before that pe- riod, and will, in our several or associate capacities, be ready when called on to assist the civil magistrate in carrying the same into ex- ecution
 5th
 That when the British Parliament shall have repealed their late obnoxious statutes, and shall recede from their claim to tax us, and make laws for us in every instance, or some general plan of union and reconciliation has been formed and accepted by America, this our Association shall be dissolved; but till then it shall remain 1Conditions mentioned by StSt. Clair in his loiter to Liout

 On the 18th of July, the Council recom- mended the enrolment of all able-bodied men into regiments or battalions, with proper officers
 Agreeably to this, the militia of Westmoreland county were enrolled, and Arthur StSt. Clair was elected Colonel
 September 26th, Council ordered £100 to be sent to Westmoreland county towards the pay- ment of arms, accoutrements, etc
 At a meeting of Council, November 20
 1775—"The commissioners and assessors of Westmoreland county returned the order sent them some time past, signed by Benju
 Franklin, or Michael Hillegas, Esq
, Treasurer of this Board, for one
 hundred pound:-, dated 2Hth September hist, and informs this committee that they have purchased from Colonel StSt. Clair 100 firelocks for the use of said county, at 40s
 each; for the payment of them they have drawn an order on this Board for two hundred pounds; this Committee in- formed them by letter that they would take the said firelocks for the use of the armed boats, and requested they would get new ones made for their county, agreeably to the Resolve of Assembly
 "Rewired, That the committee of accounts do pay Colonel StSt. Clair two hundred pounds, and take his note, conditioned to return said money, in case the above mentioned firelocks are not delivered to this committee; an order was accordingly drawn in bis favor on Thomas \Vharton and others, the committee of accounts, for said sum of two hundred pounds

 distance, where it may be impossible for the surgeon to attend them without neglecting the rest of the regiment
 Aud as to mates being readily found in Canada, I do assure you it is scarcely possible to find a person that has any knowledge, either as physician or sur- geon, in that country, some few exceptcd who have left the army and settled there
 The duty of the adjutant would be insupporta- ble without the assistance of a sergeant-major, and the quartermas- ter-sergeant is also very necessary, as not only the quarters or en- campment of the corps falls under the quartermaster's direction, but the receiving and issuing the provisions and the care of all the reg- imental stores, which it is impossible one man can at all times exe- cute; and these men ought to be acquainted with accounts
 I also beg leave to mention to you the necessity of providing tents for the troops in Canada
 The season of year is at hand when they must occupy other grounds than they have been confined to in the winter, or be exposed to have their posts insulated, and, perhaps, carried by a force much inferior to theirs, were they encamped in one body, or in such manner as to be capable of supporting each other
 And tents will become still more necessary, if there should be a necessity to attack Quebec in force, which may probably be the case
1 1 Soon after this letter was written, StSt. Clair started with his regiment to Canada
 On the 12th April he was at Fort Edward, waiting for Lake Champlnin to open so that boats could descend
 He was detained until near the close of the month before he reached the command of Major-Generul Thomas
 On the 10th of May his regiment was at Fort Deschambault
 Three days before his arrival—May 7—a council of officers, presided over by General Thomas, had voted to retreat to the river Sorel
 This was be- cause of the reported arrival of several British vessels at Quebec, and the disgraceful flight of the American troops from before that placo, who left three hundred sick, cannon and stores in the hands cf the enemy
 When General Arnold heard of this decision, he proceeded to Sorel to see if he could secure a reversal and a return to Deselmmbault, where there was still n considerable force
 Colonel St
 Clnir reached the Sorel on the 16th May, mid directly aided in preparing measures for tho retreat of the army from Canada—a measure declared to be necessary by the Commissioners of Ccn- gress, unless there was speedy relief,—who wrote to tho President of thai body with great plainness
 May llth, Dr
 Benjamin Franklin returned to Philadelphia to personally present the case to Congress
 Samuel Chase and Charles Carroll, the other Commissioners, wrote from Montreal, May 17, to President Hancock, "we want words to describe the confusion which pre- vails through every dermlment relating to the army

 367 GENERAL THOMPSON 1 TO COLONEL STSt. Clair
 CAMP AT SOREL, June 2, 1776
 •Sir:—You are immediately to proceed with the detachment under your command to Three Rivers, where you will endeavor to surprise with difficulty that either could be procured a few days ago, for ready spe- cie" "In our present critical situation, few, very few, will accept of the Continental paper money in pay
 A prosperous turn in our affairs would, we think, give it a currency in that part of the country which we possess, the moat valuable and plentiful in Canada
 \Ve think it impossible to subsist your forces in Canada in any other manner than by contract Your Generals are now obliged to be contractors and commissaries; and your Commissioners, who have neither ability nor inclination, are con- strained to act as generals
 Such is the confusion which now prevails, and will prevail till a totally new arrangement takes place, and a strict discipline is introduced into the army; of the latter you must despair, unless soldiers can he enlisted for a term of years, or for the continuance of the war
 The enlisting men for a year, or for a less time, occasioned the death of the brave Montgomery
 The recent disgraceful flight is the principal source of all the disorders in 3'our urmy
 The sending soldiers into Canada, whose times expire in a month or two after their arrival, is only putting the Colo- nies to an amazing expense, to corrupt and disorder the rest
 No duty must be expected from soldiers whose times are out, let their country stand ever so much in need of their services; witness the unfeeling flight and re- turn, at this critical juncture, of all the soldiers, and a greater part of the officers, who are entitled to be discharged
" General Thomas was unable to ascertain the strength of his army, such was the confusion which enlisting men for a short time created
 This offi- cer was taken down with the small-pox, and removed to Chambly, where he died 2d June
 Before the 27th May, however, he had, on learning of the arrival of reinforcements for the enemy, ordered Colonel Maxwell to re- treat from Three Rivers to Sorel
 He had also, without consultation with the other general officers, given orders for the removal of all the artillery and artillery stores from Sorel
 These facts were communicated to the President of Congress by the Commissioners under date of the 27th May
 They declared General Wooster, who had been invited by General Thomas to take command, ns totally unfit to conduct the war, and advised his recall
 The Commissioners added that there was no discipline among the troops, and ccuH not be while short enlistments continued
 "Your army is badly paid, and so exhausted is your credit that even a cart can not be procured without ready money or force The army is in a distressed con- dition, and is in want of the most necessary articles—meat, bread, tents, shoes, stockings, shirts, etc
 The greatest part of those who fled from Quebec left all their baggage behind them, or it was plundered by those whose times were out, and have since left Canada
" They added that the 1See note 1, next page

 the enemy posted there, making prisoners of as many as possible, and cutting off all who oppi
se you; at the same time you will be careful to secure yourself a retreat
 In executing this order, you will march to St
 Francis River, where a sufficient number of bat- eaux will meet you, and from thence it is left to your own judgment, from the information you may receive, to proceed either by land or water to Nicolet, and from thence to Three Rivers, or directly from St
 Francis to that place, in whichever way the design of your party may be best concealed
 If you march to Nicolet, it will be proper to detach one or more bateaux, well armed, to watch the mouth of the lakes, and prevent any boats or canoes carrying intelligence
 Artillery, ammunition, arms, and public stores must be brought off, if possible; but should that be found impracticable, they are to be destroyed
 I need not point out to you the necessity of your business being army did not exceed four thousand; above four hundred were sick, nnd threo-fourttis hiui not yet had the small-pox
 Such was tho extreme want-it was found necessary to seize flour by force, arid give receipts for the quan- tity, lor the payment ot which they had pledged the faith of the United States
 They Had advised this step to prevent a general massacre
 "We can not conceal our concern that six thousand men should be ordered to Canada, without taking care to have magazines formed for their subsistanee, eash to pay them, or to pay the inhabitants for their labor in transporting the bag- gage, stores, and provisions of the army
 We can not find words strong enough to describe our miserable situation
 You will have a faint idea of it if you figure to yourself an army broken and disheartened, half of it under inoculation, or other diseases; soldiers without pay, without discipline, and altogether reduced to live from hand to mouth, depending on the scouts and precarious supplies of a few half-starved cattle and trifling quan- tities of flour, which have hitherto been picked up in different parts of the country
" 1Brigadier-General William Thompson was a native of Ireland
 He em- igrated to America, and settled at Carlisle, Pa
, where he died September 4, 1781
 He was captain in the cavalry service during the French war in Can- ada, and made the acquaintance of StSt. Clair in that country at Quebec
 He resided for a time at Pittsburgh, and was one of the purchasers of old Fort Pitt when it was abandoned by the British
 In June
 177o, he was ap- pointed colonel of a regiment of riflemen, joined the American forces at Cambridge, and, November 10th had a skirmish witn the British at Lech- mere Point
 He was appointed brigadier in the Continental service, March 1, 1770; soon after succeeded Lee in command at New York, and in April WPS ordered to Canada to join General Sullivan, who had been placed in command of that department
 He arrived before General Sullivan, and about the same time as StSt. Clair with his Pennsylvania reinforcements

 369 executed with vigor, and that the most proper time for it is before day
 I wish you success and honor
 May, General Wooster declining to assume the command, General Thomp- son, as the ranking efficer, took charge of tho forces
 At this time the move- ment to Three Rivers, which was made under tho order above given, was planned
 The Canadians had variously reported the British, who had taken possession of that point after Colonel Maxwell had abandoned it and re- treated to the mouth of the Sorel, as numbering not more than from three to eight hundred
 This was a misstatement, but the movement would have been successful against a larger force, if a guide had not misled the Ameri- cans, so that when they arrived at Three Rivers it was broad daylight, and the enemy, who had been apprised of the attempt, were prepared for them
 General Thompson was himself in command, having been sent by General Sullivan to reinforce StSt. Clair, and had the misfortune to bo taken prisoner in the first action
 He was permitted to return to Pennsylvania on parole, but it was two years before he was exchanged
 A letter from him to StSt. Clair, after his return, will be found on page 379
 For an account of the battle of Three Rivers, the reader is referred to pp
 18—21 ante
 The credit for the successful withdrawal of the American army from Canada, in the face of a superior British force, thoroughly ap- pointed in every respect, is very largely due to General (then Colonel) StSt. Clair
 The following extract from a letter of an officer at Fort George to his friend in New York, taken from the files of tho A'ew Hampshire Gazelle, August 3, 1776, will give the reader a striking picture of the condition of the army as it withdrew to the Isle aux Noix: "I never knew the fatigue of a campaign until I arrived at Canada
 The most shocking scenes that ever appeared in a camp were constantly exhib- ited to view
 When General Sullivan arrived in Canada, the army was torn in pieces by sickness and other unaccountable occurrences
 A whole regi- ment was not to be found together
 General Sullivan, with his usual activ- ity and alertness, collected together a debilitated, dispirited army; tried the strength of tho enemy, who wore at least four to one, and performed one of the most remarkable retreats that was ever known
 No person who was not present can conceive a tenth part of the difficulties attending it: the enemy at our heels; three thousand of our men sick with the small-pox; those who were most healthy like so many walking apparitions; all our baggage, stores, and artillery to be removed; officers, as well as men, all employed in hauling cannon, etc
 Our loaded bateaux were all moved up the rapids six miles; one hundred of them were towed by our wearied men, up to their arm-pits in water
 This was performed in one day and a half; our sick and baggage all safely landed at St
 John's, and from thence to Crown Point, with tho loss of only three cannon, which were but poor ones
" The fightmg was done by Thompson and StSt. Clair, but General Sullivan, after the way was pointed out to him by StSt. Clair, showed great energy in tho conduct of the movement towards Crown Point
 Thence, by order of General Schuyler, the army retired to Ticonderoga

 THOMAS SMITH1 TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, August 3, 1776
 Dear Sir:—I was favored with yours by Colonel Allen, and I thank you for that unreserve with which you communicate your sentiments
 I need not say that when I found what turn affairs were like to take in Canada, I was anxious for my friend
 I felt for your situation before you wrote
 I sincerely believe that the bad suc- cess there is owing to the cause to which you ascrilw it in your let- ters to our common friend,2 for he does me the honor to show me them sometimes; he is a fine fellow, but has enemies—created, I sincerely believe, by his superior talents
 Their malice has hitherto been impotent; but they are such industrious, undermining, de- tracting rascals, that I hardly think they will rest till they have got him out,3 and a ready tool in his place
 I have been in town ever since May
 I was then chosen Repre- sentative for our county
 Immediately on my coming to town I fell sick with a very severe bilious colic, which had well nigh done for me
 I relapsed so frequently that I was obliged at last to undergo a very severe course of physic, which confined me for two months, and reduced me to a perfect skeleton; but l have every appearance of enjoying a more perfect state of health than I have for some 1 Thomas Smith, a native of Scotland, who came to America at an early age, and settled at Bedford, Pa
, studied law and became distinguished at the bar
 February 9, 1769, was appointed Deputy Surveyor, and soon after be- came Prothonotary, Clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions, und Recorder of Bedford County
 In 1775, was appointed Colonel of the militia, and in the year following was chosen a member of the State Constitutional Con- vention
 In 1780, was elected a member of the Continental Congress
 From 1791 to 17'J4, he was President of the Judicial District of Cumberland, Mifflin, Huntington, Bedford and Franklin Counties; and from 1794 to 1809, ho was Judge of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania
 He died in June of the last named year
 Judge Smith was one of the most intimate friends StSt. Clair had; acted as his legal adviser, m which capacity he often told StSt. Clair he ought to choose him guardian to look after his finances—so liberal was StSt. Clair in all money transactions—and held the same political views
 Although n member of the convention that framed the Constitution of 1770, he was never reconciled to some of its provisions, and afterward united with James Wilson and Arthur StSt. Clair in moving for a new Constitutional Con- vention

 371 years
 Hardly was I able to walk about when the convention met
1 I was chosen one of them—a pretty solou you will say
 No matter, we have now sat three weeks, and agreed upon the fundamental principles of our Government
 They are somewhat singular, how- ever
 The most of us have not had our judgment warped in favor of any other, and not a sixth part of us ever read a word on the subject
 We are only to have one Legislative branch, viz: the Assembly, who are to be chosen annually, and a rotation to take place every three years
 Instead of having a Legislative Council, it seems we are to have a convention every three, five, or seven years,2 (it is not yet settled which), who are to inquire into and sup- ply defects, deviations or abuses in the Constitution
 In what manner the executive and judicial are to be chosen I can not yet say, as we only settled the other points last meeting
 I was in a small minority
3 I believe we might have at least prevented ourselves from being ridiculous in the eyes of the world were it not for a few enthusiastic members who are totally un- acquainted with the principles of government
 It is not only that their notions are original, but they would go to the devil for popu- larity, and in order to acquire it, they have embraced levelling principles, which you know is a fine method of succeeding
 Don't, therefore, be surprised if in the next letter I write to you, I should inform you that we had passed an Agrarian Law
 With regard to any thing in the civil line that may concern you, I hardly think the convention will do any thing, but it must rest over until the government is formed and the supreme executive ap- pointed
 Should any thing of the kind come upon the carpet while I am present, I hope you will not be overlooked
 I am in hopes a temporary line between us and Virginia will be soon settled by the two conventions
 I am one of a committee to confer with their delegates on the subject
 They arc authori/ed by their convention, and made the proposal—the bearer will inform you what line they proposed
 Mrs
 StSt. Clair came soon to Bedford after I went up and before 1 The State Constitutional Convention of 1776
 2 The Council of Censors
 The first was chosen by the electors of the State seven years after the adoption of the Constitution
 StSt. Clair was elected from Philadelphia, and was one of the most active and influential members of it
 3 Mr
 Smith opposed the Constitution
 He found fault especially with those clauses which put tho legislative power in a single branch, and which restricted tho power of the executive

 you went away
 You know there is nothing coming in from the office; however, the bearer will mention that matter to you
 I really wish to see you again
 I have some reason to hope that you will soon be advanced to a higher rank
 PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS TO ARTHUR STSt. Clair, PHILADELPHIA, Augmt 10, 1776
 Sir:—The Congress having yesterday been pleased to promote you to the rank of Brigadier-General1 in the Army of the Ameri- can States, I do myself the pleasure to enclose your commission, and wish you happy
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS
 CAMP AT TICONDEROGA, Sept
 2, 1776
 Sir:—I received your favor of the 10th August, enclosing my commission as Brigadier-General, and return you thanks for the trouble you took to transmit it
 I am extremely sensible of the honor conferred upon me by the appointment, and it shall be my stndy to convince Congress that they have not misplaced their confidence
 My most respectful compliments wait upon Mrs
 Hancock
 1 For some weeks prior to the 9th August, StSt. Clair had been commanding a brigade under General Gates, who had recommended his promotion in strong terms to Congress
 On the 26th July, Colonel Mutt Ogden, in writing from Ticonderoga to Major Aaron Burr, said: "We are in great want of brigadier-generals—three at least; I mean for the men who are nowhere
 General Arnold will command the water craft on the lake in person
 There are three brigades commanded by the Colonels Heed, Stark, and StSt. Clair
 The last of these, I sincerely wish, was appointed a brigadier by Congress
 There is no better man
 The other two have full enough already
" The promotion of StSt. Clair was announced by General Washington in General Orders August 12th
 His brigade was the fourth, and consisted of his own, Dellaas's, Winds's, Wayne's, and Nelson's independent regiments
 The promotion excited the jealousy of Arnold who, although a brigadier, did not like to see any other officer of ability placed on the same plane with himself; and Colonel Maxwell, a very meritorious officer and friend to StSt. Clair, thought it hard he should be overlooked for the benefit of a junior officer
 At this time the army nt Ticonderoga numbered over nine thousand effective men
 After the destruction of the fleet under Arnold, Generals Gates, Schuyler and Arnold called lustily for several thousand more troops
 See correspondence of these officers with Washington (Sparks), and with President Hancock (Force'e American Archives)

 373 THOMAS SMITH TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, '2'2d August, 1776
 My Dear Friend:—I was favored with yours1 last night by Cap- tain Rippy
 I uow know by experience, what I always believed, that elevation does not make you forget your friends
 You will, perhaps, be of opinion that I am not that sincere friend you take me to be, when I inform you that the intelligence you gave me on that head gave me far less pleasure than you supposed it would; the reason is, I knew it long before, for no sooner was you appointed Brigadier-General but our worthy friend Wilson communicated the agreeable news to me, upon which I wrote to most of our friends to whom I knew the news would give pleasure
 It is not your elevation alone that I congratulate you upon; but I can assure you, from undoubted authority, that your military character stands as high with Congress as that of any general on
 the continent, and I flatter myself that you have as good a chance for even a more elevated rank than that to which you are lately raised
 Whatever has been said, or whatever may be said to the contrary, I think every man's own heart will tell him that self has a considerable share in the direction of all our thoughts and actions
 I feel an instance of it upon this occasion, for though I do sincerely rejoice at the elevation of a much esteemed friend, yet I am not without my fears that I shall by that means be deprived of the pleasure which I enjoyed in the company of that friend
 I feel the truth of your sentiments with regard to the Constitution that we are about forming
 In several sects of religionists in the different ages of the world, and in some even now, inspiration was supposed to have a considerable share in the direction of their ac- tions, and they very gravely supposed themselves gifted with it
 I believe we shall have the honor of first introducing the same doc- trine into modern polities
 A motion was made, without a blush, by a member, that whatever might require the consideration of the House might be printed before any resolve was passed upon it, for the use of the members, as several of them could read print better than writing
 Our principle seems to be this: that any man, even the most illiterate, is as capable of any office as a person who has had the benefit of education; that education perverts the under- standing, eradicates common honesty, and has been productive of all the evils that have happened in the world
 In order that inspira- 1 The letters of StSt. Clair to Judge Smith have not been found

 tion may be our only guide, every person who is to be chosen into any office that was formerly supposed to require some degree of human knowledge and experience to enable the person to execute it with justice—every such person, I say—is to be turned out before he can possibly acquire any experience—e
 g
, in the form of gov- ernment now debating in the House
 The committee have brought in one article, that the justices of the peace shall be chosen by the people in the respective districts wherein they reside; turned out every seven years and a new set chosen in the same manner
 We are not come to it yet, but by the complexion of the House I have reason to think it will pass
 We are determined not to pay the least regard to the former Constitution of this Province, but to reject every thing therein that may be proposed, merely because it was part of the former Constitution
 We are resolved to clear every part of the old rubbish out of the way and begin upon a clean foundation
 You know that experimental philosophy was in great repute fifty years ago, and we have a mind to try how the same principle will succeed in polities! You learned fellows who have warped your understandings by poring over musty old books, will perhaps laugh at us; but, know ye, that we despise you
 The situation of this country, as well as that of Mind Britain, must give great anxiety to every person who is not callous to the feelings of humanity, They seem to have been in the same situa- tion for some time past with regard to their intellects as the builders of Babel were in respect of their [out]
 God knows how the de- structive dispute will end
 I think the ruin of Britain is inevitable, and her existence as a powerful kingdom is near at an end
 We will undoubtedly feel sorely the effects of the dispute; but I can not help being of opinion that, according to the course of human affairs, we must, in the enTl, prevail
 As to your verbal intelligence, you will have heard before this can reach you that part of it is true and part false, as is always the case
 No news here
 Mr
 Woods came down last night
 Your family are well—not increased when he came away
 As for myself, I have the honor to serve the public and receive nothing for it; but that it putt- it out of my power to serve myself by going to the woods, for, as there is at present, and like to be through our great wisdom, a suspension of all law for a considera- ble time, nothing is to be done in that channel, and from the temper of the times no person has any security, let his conduct have been what it will, that he will not be superseded by any being of a day

 375 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO LIEUTENANT-COLONKL ALLEN
l TICOXDEROGA, September 1, 1770
 Dear Sir:—This is my third to you since yours of the 25th of July
 Whether the former have reached you or not is doubtful, as our communication seems not to be much more open than hereto- fore; how that happens, God knows, but certain it is few letters to or from this army get on
 I wish you had returned to the regiment
 Though I well know your sentiments, I really expected you would have come back
 "The osier keeps its footing when the oak is torn up by the roots
" You know my way of thinking, and you know likewise the obligations I have to your family—obligations which no change of circumstances can ever cancel
 But you will excuse me, my dear sir, when I say that I believe it would have been true policy to have given some way to the temper of the times
 If I remember rightly, there were two points on which we were perfectly agreed: First, that independence was not the interest of America if the liberties of America could be otherwise secured; Secondly, if foreign troops were employed to reduce America to ab- solute submission, that independence or any other mode was justifi- able
 There is now no doubt about the employment of foreign troops, which I own I think was the watchword to every man of property in America; for I doubt very much whether, if Great Britain should succeed by force, if much odds would be made by the lordly conquerors betwixt friends and foes, or if nature and for- 1 William Allen, a Pennsylvania Loyalist, son of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, belonged to one of the wealthiest and most distinguished of the old families of that Province of the Penns, and, after the first year of the revolution, espoused the British cause
 He was a lieutenant-colonel in the Continental service in the early part of 1776, and served under StSt. Clair in Canada
 After the retreat of the Americans to Crown Point, he returned to Philadelphia, and, in common with other friends of the Penns at this period, concluded that the only safety for the country was in ad- herence to the mother country
 He obtained leave to resign his commission in the Continental service, and, at the close of 1770, joined Lord Howe
 Ho cndi-avored to enlist a regiment of Pennsylvania Loyalists in 1778, but he Was disappointed
 Less than three hundred joined him
 His regiment look part in the defense of Pensacola acainst the French and Spaniards
 He was in New Krunswick in 1783
 In the letter above given, StSt. Clair, mindful of obligations to Chief-Justice Allen, endeavors to dissuade the son from the step which he had avowed it his purpose to take in the letter to which this is the reply

 Do not, my dear sir, imagine my late promotion has altered my sentiments
 I will own to you I am pleased, not flattered, with it

 You know I am a bad politician, but if you have not al- ready taken too decisive a part, I can not say one word more about the matter; and when I reflect on your own good sense and the superior understanding and experience of many of your friends, it would be insolence to you to offer advice

 Sir:—By command of his Excellency, I have the honor to trans- mit you the inclosed resolve1 of Congress, the original of which this 1 Rcsulrnf—That General Washington bo directed forthwith to order under his imtnc4ili:ito comir
and such of the forces, now in the Northern Depart- ment, as have been raised in the States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and that the commanding officer in the Northern Department be directed to apply to the Legislatures of the Eastern States, to afford him such assist- ance us they may stand in need of
—Journal* of Congress, Saturday, No- vember 23, 1770
 This resolution was in consequence of the movement of General Howe toward Philadelphia in force
 General Washington had but few troops to interpose, and his situation was very critical
 It was at this time that StSt. Clair was directed to join him with his brigade
 Scarcely any halt was made at Albany
 As soon as boats were procured StSt. Clair proceeded south- ward, but was intercepted by an order from General Lee to join his divis- ion, which was following in the rear of *he British army, notwithstanding Washington had ordered him several weeks before to join him
 After the capture of General Lee (see p
 28), General StSt. Clair proceeded immediately to join General Washington
 On the 10th December, we find the latter proposing to send him to command the New Jersey militia that had been recruited in that part of (he State where General Lee had been operating

 379 minute came to hand; and I am to request you, in his name, to have the purport of it complied with, by sending down, with all possible expedition, the whole of the troops belonging to the States of Pennsylvania and Jersey which are in the Northern Depart- ment, to join the army under his immediate command
 You will please to order them to fall in on the communication leading from New York to Philadelphia, at Brunswick, or between that and Princeton, and to direct their march by a back and secure route, that it may not be liable to be interrupted by the enemy
 I have mentioned Brunswick, supposing and hoping that we shall be able to make a stand there; however, his Excellency begs you will di- rect the commanding officers of the troops to send him frequent ex- presses, to advise of their approaches, and by which means their destination may be explicitly pointed out
 At present it is conjec- ture
 It must depend on several circumstances
 I have not time to add much, therefore shall only inform you that the enemy are in possession of Hackensack, and are now pushing this way

 CLAIB
 BALTIMORE,1 December 30, 1776
 My Dear Sir:—With peculiar pleasure I congratulate you on the victory at Trenton
2 I take it the tide is now turning, and will soon run high in our favor
 I have written to General Washington, recommending Colonel Irvine to a regiment, and Mr
 Robert Smith (a young gentleman of great merit, who studied law with me), to a troop of horse
 You will oblige me much by adding your influence to the recommenda- tion, and by letting me know the result of it as soon as possible
 GENERAL THOMPSON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 CARLISLE, January 11, 1777
 My Dear General:—This will be handed to you by your old and sotno of the money necessary to pay expenses of re-enlistment

 very worthy friend, Major Dick Butler,1 who longs much to see you
 The bad treatment the Major and some other officers of the regiments have met with, requires the notice of every General in the army who wishes to serve his country, and as I know well your steady attachment to both your friends and country, make no doubt, when yon are informed how matters stand respecting the officers in Colonel Mackay's regiment, but you will take such steps as will en- able those who think themselves injured to vindicate their characters, and purge the army, as soon as possible, of those who have acted out of character as gentlemen and officers
 The good of the service has obliged me to make use of arguments with the Major and Mr
 Huffhagle, to engage them to continue in the regiment after they can have a hearing before a court-martial
 I must confess they have suffered much, but they must be prevailed on to continue, or the usefulness of the regiment will be lost
 We both know the Colonel to be a good officer, and a man of strict honor and great goodness of heart, but it will be impossible for him alone to manage the regiment or get duty done, if the Major and Mr
 Huffuagle leave him
 From what I have been' well informed of, I think some of the officers must go to the left about, and Huffnagle will make an excellent Major, and as the ranks of the captains are not yet fixed, it can't give any great uneasiness to them; but in case it should, I don't know any of them fit to be raised a step higher— two only excepted—that ought to mount a ladder
 Mv dear StSt. Clair, when last I had the pleasure of seeing you,2 I even envied you the fatigues you had then to encounter
 I now most heartily rejoice on account of your successes, and more and more wish to share the dangers and honors that may await you
 P
 P
—If you can't possibly reconcile Butler and Iluffhairle to stay in Mackay's regiment, you must see and provide for them in one of the new ones
 Good officers must not be lost
 1 Uichard Butler, the most distinguished of the fighting Butlers
 He was soon promoted to bo Lieutenant-Colonel of Morgan's rifle corps, and subse- quently Colonel of the Ninth Pennsylvania, He was agent for Indian affairs in 1787-88, and in 1791 was commissioned a Major-General, com- manded the right wing of St
 Chiir's army moving against the Indians, and was killed November 4, of that year
 2 At the battle of Three Rivers, where General Thompson had the mis- fortune to be captured
 He was permitted to go on parol, but the delay in his exchange bore hard on his spirits
 He blamed Congress with it in a let- ter to St
 Ckir, written in April this year, in which he said that as he was not permitted to curse that body, he would turn his wrath against the Con- stitution of Pennsylvania, which he cursed with great heartiness

 My Dear General:—It is long since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you; but am sensible that you have as good, if not better, reasons for not writing than ever I had
 The active and glorious scenes in which you have lately borne a share are a sufficient apology to your friends for not being favored with your letters
 It comforts me to hear of you when I can not hear/rom you
 I have enjoyed nine days at home; and in that time have seen my family increased by the addition of a fine young boy
 The sit- uation of public affairs is so interesting that I find myself incapable of fixing upon those tranquil pleasures in my library, of which I have often formed such fond ideas when perplexed and distracted with business
 While I can not forbear thinking of the public, I believe it will be best for me to continue acting in it (provided that can happen with propriety), and return to Baltimore as soon as I can leave Mrs
 Wilson
 I feel very sensibly for General Mercer's misfortune; and for the loss the service will sustain in being deprived for some time of his valuable talents
 I hope, however, he will
recover and do well
1 Colonel Mackay and Major Butler will inform you of the very extraordinary proceedings of the Captains and subalterns in the Westmoreland regiment
 They have gone so far as even to sus- pend the Major
2 You know his worth and character
 From all the accounts I have had from gentlemen upon whose judgments I can rely, I am satisfied that he has great merit as an officer; and that his merit has been the cause of the persecution raised against him
 But I need not stimulate your own friendship for him
 These committee appointments play vengeance
 If the Captains and subalterns succeed in this stroke against their Major, I have no doubt but that the next one will be aimed at the head of the Colonel
 Indeed, I have good reason to conclude that this is part of the plan originally laid
 1This refers to the battle of Princeton, in the enrly part of which General Mercer was mortally wounded
 As he was left in the care of the Quaker family named Clark, where ho fell, his fate was not known at the time this letter was written
 2This is the same difficulty referred to in the letter of General Thompson
 On account of appointments being made on recommendation of committees, the subordinate officers attempted to dictate who should bo field officers

 GENERAL ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JAMES WILSON
 MORIUSTOWN, February 10, 1777
 Dear Sir:—I was favored with a letter from you yesterday
 I heartily congratulate you on the addition to your family
 As Mrs
 Wilson has recovered, such a nine days was worth an age
 I wish it was possible that you could enjoy the tranquil pleasures of retire- ment, but it is not a time to think of them; and believe me, my dear friend, although it is not much to your taste, your figure is at least as respectable in public as amiable in private life
 Colonel Maekay is not yet come up, and I have just heard that he lies sick at Trenton, but I have made the General1 acquainted with the confusion and the causes of it that prevails in that regiment, and I have no doubt that the authors will meet with their deserts
 This will be handed you by Major Ollendorf, an officer, I believe, of merit, and who, it seems to me, has been sent here upon a wild goose chase
 Most of the foreigners that have yet been employed are mere-adventurers, but I do not believe that in his case; he has behaved well here
 After all this preface, I don't know what should follow, but it is next to impossible that an utter stranger, and one who has not the language of the country, should succeed in raising a corps, and the expenses attending frequent journeys are so much greater than the allowance that it can not but disgust those who have no attachments but the profession of a soldier
 If some of- ficers were appointed to him who have connections, his corps might be raised, and I am fully persuaded it would not be long before he would discipline them
 This moment I received yours of the 28th ultimo
 I am very sorry that neither Colonel Irvine nor Mr
 Smith have succeeded, which I informed you of before
 The General does not choose to go so largely into the horse as Congress has empowered him; at least until he sees the regiments he has already officered nearly complete; when that happens, and more horse should be thought necessary, Colonel Irvine has, I believe, his promise, and I have it likewise for Mr
 Smith; and the general has pleased to express uneasiness that application had not been made earlier
 The enemy are still in Jersey, but they have very little rest
 We give them a brush every other day, and we are certain that they are in great want of both forage and provisions
 They can not possibly stay here
 But where will they go to? Perhaps to Dela- 1 General Washington

 That is, however, my way of thinking; and had \ve somebody at the head of the army in New York, they would soun be obliged to go somewhere else; but I must not speak ill of my superiors, and indeed I do not know the man at all
 Major Ollendorf waits for this letter
 I assure (you) I have not ceased to write by every opportunity
 You will get them all by and by, and I shall continue to do so, for I know but few things in this world that gives me greater pleasure
1 Tom Smith is here, and I write this at Colonel Biddle's office, who sends a whole bundle of correspondence
 STSt. Clair PROMOTED FOR GALLANTRY AT TRENTON AND PRINCETON
 BALTIMORE, February 22, 1777
 Sir:—The Congress having been pleased to promote you to the rank of major-general in the army of the United States, I do my- self the pleasure to inclose your commission
 Confident of your ardor in the cause of America, and of your attachment to her liber- ties, I am persuaded you will, on all occasions, show yourself every way deserving the honor your country has now conferred upon you
 With the warmest wishes for your health and prosperity, I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient and humble servant, JOHN HANCOCK, Pres't
 You will please to acknowledge the receipt of this letter and com- mission
 HON
 MAJOR-GENERAL STSt. Clair
 JAMES WILSON TO MAJOR-GENERAL STSt. Clair
 February 20, 1777
 My Dear Sir:—Yesterday, Congress proceeded to the promotion of general officers
 There was much difficulty and delicacy in set- tling the principles on which the promotions ought to be founded
 I expressed my sentiments in favor of adhering to the line of action before marked out, but said that if it were proper to deviate from that line, you were the officer in whose favor the alteration ought to be made
 Lord Sterling, General Mifflin, yourself, General Ste- 1 The original letter is in the possession of Lewis J
 Cist, Esq i Cincinnati

384 The StSt. Clair Papers
 phen, aud General Lincoln were chosen major-generals
 I need not express mv satisfaction at your promotion
 I feel peculiarly pleased that I have seen the event take place before I leave Con- gress
 I am exceedingly hurt that our deserving friend, General Thomp- son, was passed over
 It is a misfortune sufficient to be a prisoner
 I am, however, willing to believe that the only reason with many gentlemen for omitting him was an apprehension that a promotion would increase the difficulty of his exchange
 If you have not already engaged yourself, you will much oblige me by appointing Billy Bird your aid-de-camp
 You will recollect that, when he first entered into service, I was solicitous he should be formed under you
 You know, however, of his activity
 He is young, but he is far from being perfect in sense and judgment
 If he is not yet exchanged, I hope his exchange will soon take place
 I have been informed that he has either obtained, or has a prospect of obtaining, a lieutenancy in the Light Horse
 But I would, on every account, prefer what I now recommend him to
 I have good reason to believe, and think it not improper to hint, that the important command of Ticouderoga is destined for your next campaign
1 I presage it a theater of glory
 COLONEL WAYNE* TO PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS
 TICONDEROGA, February 2, 1777
 Sir:—Inclosed is the return of this garrison, together with the appraisement and receipt for goods sent to the public store
 You 1Judge "Wilson's prediction was correct
 But, after StSt. Clair's promotion, and before his appointment to the Northern Department, he continued to serve under 'Washington
 On the 10th of March, General Washington asked General Gates, who was in command ut Philadelphia, to resume the office of adjutant-general, and notified him that he should send Major-General StSt. Clair to take his place
 Gates was looking for something else; declined the place of adjutant-general, and on the 2oth of March was appointed by Con- gress to the command of the Northern Department, in place of General Schuyler
 On the 22d of May following, he was superseded by General Schuyler
 General StSt. Clair had been selected to servo as second in com- mand, but he did not leave his post at Philadelphia until General Schuyler's restoration
 2Colonel Anthony Wayne had been placed in command of the garrison at Ticonderogn in the latter part of the preceding November, with instruc- tions to complete the fortifications
 Little could be done
at that, as the want

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 385 will observe that only two small regiments of militia Lave yet ar- rived to relieve the old garrison, and that the Second and Fourth regiments of Pennsylvania, whose times were expired near a mouth, have marched for Philadelphia; the Sixth regiment, belonging to the same State, will also march the 8th instant; their times expired the 9th of January, so that if troops don't shortly arrive, this gar- rison will be left very weak indeed
 I have wrote timely and fre- quently to General Schuyler on the occasion, and have once more urged him to push up troops and provisions with all possible dis- patch
 I am sorry to say that this post has been much neglected, and unless speedy and vigorous measures are used in gathering in supplies, the season will be lost in which it can be done; and per- haps, after ail the expense and trouble in endeavoring to render the post tenable, it will be left an easy prey to the enemy, owing to a lack of troops and supplies
 I shall omit nothing in my power to guard against a surprise, and although our numbers are few, yet I am under no apprehension but I shall be able to maintain this post (unless provisions fail) until a sufficient reinforcement can have time to arrive
 I hope soon to have it in my power to give you some in- formation of the motions or intentions of the enemy in this quarter
 COLONEL ANTHONY WAYNE TO MAJOR-GENERAL GATES
 TICONDEROGA, February 4,1777
 My Dear General:—This garrison now consists of only four weak regiments—one Pennsylvania, one New Jersey, and two regiments of militia from the State of the Massachusetts Bay, amounting in the whole to about twelve hundred, sick and well
 That from Penn- sylvania will march the day after to-morrow; we shall then be re- duced to nine hundred
 I have not been able to prevail on the Eastern troops to stay one hour longer than the expiration of their time
 I have done every thing that lay in my power to render this post tenable, by surrounding the works with wide and good abatis
 I have also provided timber for the block-houses, which will be erected in a few days, and dropped the notion of pickets, as we of clothing and hospital stores rendered the condition of the men so wretched as to preclude all other thought but that of trying to preserve life until spring should come
 25

386 The StSt. Clair Papers
 could not man them
 Cumberland Bay is yet open; otherwise we should, in all probability, have received a visit long since from the enemy, who, as I learn, had collected all the sleighs in Canada for the purpose
 I have a prospect of being soon reinforced from the eastward
 In the present debilitated state of the garrison we can do little more than mount the proper guards, keep out the usual scouts, and find firewood, a stock of which I wish to have beforehand in case of an attack, which probably will not be before the lake breaks up, unless Cumberland Bay should close soon
 I should esteem it as a particular favor if you could get me relieved, my health being much impaired
 I have been necessitated to act as quartermaster, commissary, en- gineer and commandant, and worried with wretches applying for discharges or furloughs, as you used to be, until I am become a mere skeleton
 I am next to inform you that this post has been too much ne- glected, and I fear, notwithstanding all the expense and trouble we have had last summer and this winter to render it tenable, it will be left an easy prey to the enemy for want of proper supplies to main- tain an army in the spring, owing to a supineness somewhere
 Present my most respectful compliments to General Washington and Generals Mifflin and StSt. Clair
 COLONEL ANTHONY WAYNE TO GENERAL SOHUYLER
 TICONDEHOGA, February 4,1777
 Sir:—I have the pleasure to inform you that an officer, with part of Colonel 's regiment, arrived here last evening from Num- ber Four, and says the whole regimeut, consisting of upwards of three hundred men, may be expected in two or three days
 They are from the State of New Hampshire, and enlisted during the war
 They arc coming at a very seasonable time, as the Sixth Penn- sylvania Battalion are just about to leave the ground, and our gar- rison so debilitated that we were hard pushed for men to furnish the necessary guards, scouts, and fatigues
 I have a scouting party down the lake as far as •Gilliland's Creek, where it is said some Indian tracks have lately been discovered
 The enemy have given out that they intend paying us a visit, but that they can not do so unless Cumberland Bay shuts up; as yet it is open, and probably will continue so during the winter, unless there comes very severe weather indeed

 387 I have been necessitated to stop a number of sleigbs to haul the abatis, treating them with kindness and paying them for their labour
 I have heard no complaint, and conclnde they are well content
 I have in view a project of driving piles across the channel oppo- site one of the redoubts, to which a boom may be fixed that will be a sufficient barrier against the enemy's vessels
 This will require a good deal of labour
 If it should meet your approbation, please to order up one of the engineers to superintend the work
 I shall be able to communicate to him the plan and manner in which it mav be executed
 COLONEL ANTHONY WAYNE TO GENERAL SCHUYLER, TICONDEROOA, 23ni March, 1777
 Dear General:—It is the opinion of those who are best acquainted with Lake Champlain, that it will be navigable in the course of two or three weeks at farthest
 It is, therefore, mv duty to inform you that we have not more than twelve hundred men, sick and well, officers in- cluded, on the ground; four hundred of which are militia, whose times- expire in ten days; nor from what I can learn, by the best authority, is there any probability of a sufficient number of troops arriving from the eastward, for a very considerable time, as few, if any of their regiments are near full, and great part of those who were en- listed have deserted or are straggling through the country
 Add to this, that their officers seem seized with a general torpor (which can not be accounted for), especially at a time when every effort is ab- solutely necessary to push on the troops, and to give them some idea of duty and discipline previous to their entering into action
 I must beg, sir, that you would once more endeavor to rouse the public officers in those States from their shameful lethargy before it be too late
 I do assure you that there is not one moment to spare in bringing in troops and the necessary supplies
 The few men I have on the ground arc put to hard, very hard dutv; but thev go through all with a readv cheerfulness, conscious of the pressing ne- cessitv
 Whilst I am writing, Mr
 Adams, who lives at Lake George lauding, has arrived almost spent
 He, with Captain Baldwin of the Rangers, belonging to Stillwater, and twenty-one men, were made prisoners at Sabbath-day Point by a party of Cochuawago In- dians and Canadians, amounting to about twenty, under the com-
Page 388

388 The StSt. Clair Papers
 mand of Captain McCoy, of the Regulars
 Lieutenant Henry, with five others belonging to Colonel Van Sehaick's regiment, are killed
 Adams and two of the soldiers were taken last Wednes- day afternoon
 Captain Baldwin and the other prisoners were sur- prised and taken asleep, at the Point, about three o'clock the next morning
 Lieutenant Henry defended himself with great bravery for a considerable time, dangerously wounding two of the Indians with his navy
 He at last fell, worthy of a better fate
 Adams says he informed him of another party hovering round this post; but, if that was true, I believe they would not have mentioned it
 He further says that the Indians came by the way of Omergotehy, and that he was set at liberty on account of being weakly and a former acquaintance of Captain McCoy, who also informed him that the enemy are collected at St
 John's, Chambly, and Montreal, and their vicinity
 I have sent Captain Whitcomb, with a party of Rangers, to bury the dead, and hope soon to retaliate on the Brit- ish butchers
 COLONEL WAYNE TO GOVERNOR BOWDOIN AND COUNCIL OF MASSACHUSETTS BAY
 TICONDEROGA, 25th March, 1777
' Gentlemen:—A party of Cochnawago Indians, under the com- mand of a Captain McCoy, of the British forces, have killed sev- eral of our people, and taken Captain Baldwin, with twenty-one men, prisoners, at a place called Sabbath-day Point, on the 20th instant, by which means the enemy, who are now all collected at Mon- treal, Chambly, St
 John's, and their vicinity, will be but too soon informed of the debilitated state of this garrison, which at present does not consist of more than twelve hundred men, sick and well, officers included, four hundred of which are militia from Berkshire and Hampshire, in your State, whose times expire in ten days—but this in confidence
 It is the opinion of those who are best acquainted with the Lake Champlain, that it will be navigable in the course of two or three weeks at farthest, so that we have every reason to expect that the enemy here in full force as soon as that happens, being ready pre- pared for the purpose
 It is my duty, therefore, to request you, in the most pressing manner, to use every possible means in pushing on the troops— properly equipped
 Nearly one-half of those who arrived are destitute of arms and accouterments, and sent on without any officers, except a few subalterns
 For God sake, rouse your field and other officers
Page 389

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 389 from their lethargy
 It is their duty to be on the spot, in order to maneuver their people, and to give them some idea of discipline previous to their entering into action
 I would beg leave to suggest that the most speedy way of for- warding the baggage and other necessaries, through these hid roads, will be by pack-horses; you can not use too much dispatch; there is not one moment to spare I am confident that you have too just a sense of the importance of this place to suffer it to be lost for want of timely succors, when in your power to throw them in
 I shall, therefore, say no more on the subject, thau just to assure you that nothing shall be wanting on my part to render the post tenable, and to defend it to the last extremity
 Captain Reyman, a gentleman well acquainted with this lake, and a worthy officer, who is charged with this express, will be able to give you such other information as you may require
 Just as Captain Reyman was setting off, he was taken violently ill
 Lientenant McLean is, therefore, charged with the express
 He is another trusty officer

 Sir:—The enclosed return will clearly show you the debilitated state of this garrison
 It ha-s been very fluctuating of late
 The militia are now all gone, and those contained in the return are raised on the new establishment
 I hope soon to receive a considerable reinforcement, as General Schuyler has dispatched expresses to the neighboring States for that purpose
 I have also sent to the State 1 This letter, the first druft of which was retained by Colonel Wayne, and is included among the StSt. Clair Vapors, is also found in the Massachusetts Archicc

 of the Massachusetts Bay, urging the Council to push on the troops and necessary supplies with all possible dispatch
 There will be an open navigation on Lake Champlain before this reaches you, and I have reason to expect the enemy here in full force as soon as the ice will permit
 We are preparing to receive them
 The ready cheerfulness with which officers and men un- dergo all fatigue and difficulties, I take as a happy presage that they are determined to defend the post to the last extremity
 I can't forbear mentioning my surprise at the total neglect of the navy
 You may rest assured that the enemy have not more than four vessels of force on the lake, exclusive of two taken from us, and about twenty-five or thirty fiat-bottomed boats
 It is said that they are building four more
 Even then they will have but ten, and I am well convinced that in the course of eight weeks we could build vessels sufficient with those we already have to command the lake; and as to rigging, strip but the one-third of the prizes taken from the enemy, and now laid up to the eastward, they will be more than sufficient for the purposes; this once done, an army of two thousand or three thousand men will be sufficient not only to gar- rison this post, but put the enemy in constant alarm and oblige them to put a large army of observation in Canada
 On the contrary, let them remain in command of the lake, they need not more than one thousand laud forces, with what savages and Canadians they can raise, to oblige us to maintain an army of at least five thousand men to watch their motions, whilst the re- mainder of their forces may be sent round and act in conjunction with their troops to the southward
 But was a fleet to be created, they dare not show one man from Canada
 The very expense of paying and maintaining three thousand extraordinary for six months would give you the command of the lake
 You must at one day have it; the soouer, therefore, the better

 There were two howitzers at Half Moon; if they are not yet sent forward, pray order them with such ammunition, ordnance and orduance stores as are at Albany (for this post) to be scut forward with all possible dispatch, let the expense be what it will
 If the roads are bad, it's only adding a sufficient force of horses to the carriages
 Our situation admits of no delay
 I have reason to believe the enemy are advancing
 A strong party of them were discovered three days ago at the Four Brothers; and some of their boats were plying between that and Gilliland's Creek
 Previous to the receipt of this intelligence, I had sent a de- tachment under Lieutenant-Colonel Bassett to that place for prov- ender
 I have since ordered another party in armed boats to try to bring him off and cover his retreat
 I hope they will effect it
 COLONEL ANTHONY WAYNE TO MAJOR-GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROGA, 14th April, 1777
 Dear General:—A scouting party returned yesterday from Onion River, with advice that the enemy have a strong detachment on the Four Brothers, and that their boats were seen plying between that and Gilliland's Creek
 Previous to the receipt of this intelligence, I had sent a party under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Bas- sett to that creek for provender, and have since dispatched another detachment in armed bateaux to bring-him off and cover his re- treat
 I hope they will effect it, as the loss of his party would be too sensibly felt
 We have received but a very small reinforce- ment since the last return I made you
 I can't account for the happiness of the Eastern States with re- spect to this post on any other principle but the general received notion that no attack will be made here
 However, a few days will probably reduce this matter to a certainty, as the lake has been nav- igable about a week
 22, 1770, was placed in command of the First New York battalion, and af- terwards sent to Cherry Valley to protect the inhabitants against the Indians; served as brigadier-general under Lord Stirling at the battle of Alonmouth, and in April, 1779, at the head of a select force, destroyed the OnondagA set- tlements, nnd received vote of thanks from Congress
 Appointed brigadier- general by brevet October 10, 1783
 He was born 1737; died July 4, 1789

 PHILADELPHIA, 27th March, 1777
 My Dear Sir:—I have been favored with two letters from you since my return to Philadelphia
 Your promise to write to me once a week gives me great pleasure, but it will give me still greater pleasure to see you soon
 This, I have some hopes, will be the case, as General Gates is now appointed to the command at Ticon- deroga
1 I can more than conceive what you feel at your long ab- sence from your family
 You particularly oblige me by reserving a place for Billy Bird
 As some late difficulties are now removed from the cartel, his ex- change, I hope, may soon take place
 I have resumed my seat in Congress
 My reason is, that if at any time I can be useful to my country, I can at this
 Pennsylvania is in the greatest confusion ; * perhaps order may, at last, arise from it
 The very critical situation of public affairs is of much advan- tage to the Assembly and their friends
 I shall write you more fully, soon

 Dear Sir:—I am favored with yours of the 15th

 General StSt. Clair being ordered to Tieonderoga, but 
previously to repair to this city to await the further order of Congress, you will please to direct him to repair here accordingly us soon as possible
"—President Han- cock to Gcaeral Waxldngfim, April 4, 1777
 2 The return of Mr
 Wilson to Congress was in compliance with the ear- nest entreaties of General Washington, who greatly needed at this time the support of the best men of the country
 The situation in Pennsylvania is described by the Commander-in-Chief in a letter to General Schuyler, writ- ten at Morristown, in March (See Spnrks, Vol
 IV
, p
 300): "The disaffec- tion in Pennsylvania, which I fear is much beyond anything you have con- ceived, and the depression of the people of this State, render a strong sup- port necessary to prevent a systematical submission; besides, the loss of Philadelphia would prove a very great injury, as we draw from thence al- most all mil' supplies

2 COLONEL ANTHONY WAYNE TO GENERAL GATES
 TICONDEROGA, 25th April, 1777
 Dear General:—Our force is so very small that, after furnishing the necessary guards—garrisoning the block-houses aud half man- ning the vessels, together with the usual scouts—we have very few cation of Washington to Congress, referred to in the above letter, is not included in Sparks's collection
 1 StSt. Clair hnd expressed a desire to be under Washington, but, while not being pleased with the resolve of Congress assigning him to Ticonderoga, he proceeded to that post with the alacrity of a good soldier
 •General StSt. Clair's appointment to the command of Tieonderoga gave great umbrage to General Sullivan, who thought he should have been first preferred
 On the 16th March General Washington took notice of his pique in a kind but severe letter, which opened in these words: "Do not, my dear General Sullivan, torment yourself any longer with imaginary slights, and involve others in tho perplexities you feel on that score," and then proceeds to justify the assignment of StSt. Clair and other officers, and concludes: "But I have not time to dwell upon a subject of this kind
 I shall quit it with an earnest exhortation, that you will not suffer yourself to bo teased with evils that only exist in the imagination, and with slights that have no existence at all; keeping in mind, at tho same time, that, if distant armies are to be formed, there are several gentlemen before you in point of rank, who have a right to claim a preference

 men left for fatigue
 Our whole force, officers, artificers, sailors, marines, artillery, rank and file, sick and well, don't amount to nineteen hundred—one-fourth part of whom are destitute of arms, so that I have been necessitated to substitute spears in their place
 And, from what I can learn, there is not much probability of our having any great addition to this force, for a very considerable time—so that the militia are absolutely necessary to assist in putting the place in some better position of defense, as we can't out of this debilitated army furnish fatigue men sufficient for the purpose
 I have sent Lieutenant Barber to Albany for four hundred stand of arms, as it will require that number to complete those who are now on the ground without any
 You will please to order them on with all possible dispatch
 We have secured the pass between Mount Independence and Ticonderoga in such a manner that the enemy's ships can not get through below; and, in case of an at- tack, you may rest assured that this post shall be defended until succours can have time to arrive
 STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE IN COMMITTEE OF SAFETY TO DELE- GATES IN CONGRESS
 May KM, 1777
 Gentlemen:—About one-half of the troops proportioned to this State to raise as their quota for the Continental Army have marched for Ticonderoga, and most of them, we suppose, are at that place by this time
 Another quarter will be on their march in a very few days, and the remainder as soon as possible
 Every nerve is exert- ing among the friends of the country to engage and forward them
 They arc but very ill clothed, and, as cloth caa not be procured on any terms for that purpose, unless Congress will order Colonel Laugdon to let the State have some out of those in his hands, which we desire you to endeavor to procure
 We have scarce any stock of lead and flints, and only three small field pieces in the State; therefore would have you solicit orders to Colonel Langdon to keep in this State three or four field pieces, and such quantity of lead and flint as the general concern will admit of; a company of artillery- men will voluntarily engage in this town
 A great number of our militia are without fire-arms, and the greater part they have arc but ordinary—if there is such a supply on the continent that consist- ently a small magazine might be left in this State, to be used only in case of an attack, it might be of great advantage

 395 many circumstances come to hand which make it probable a descent will soon be made on our coast
 We have made several discoveries of combinations made by the Tories in Hillsborough and western parts of Massachusetts Bay, and upper part of this county; we have reason to believe, by information of persons on oath, that some have combined to take arms and join the enemy, when an op- portunity offers; though we hope their numbers are not large
 We have just heard a hogshead of entrenching tools is discovered under a barn in Holies, and a considerable of liquors, some provisions and firearms in and about Groton in the Massachusetts
 Interesting matters are opening, and it is probable all our jails will soon be filled with these more than monsters in the shape of men, who would wreck their native country, in hopes to have some of the plunder
 Although our difficulties are great, and appear to be in- creasing, yet a spirit seems to rise with the difficulties among most of our people which we hope will not easily be crushed
 GENERAL GATES TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 ALBANY, 30fA May, 1777
 Sir:—Late last night the inclosed from General Poor,1 was 1 TICONDEROQA, May 27, 1777
—10 o'clock at night
 Dear Sir:—Preparatory to the execution of a plan to surprise any ports which the enemy muy have established on the lake
 I thought it proper yesterday to dispatch a reconnoitering party, with orders to proceed to Split Rock, lust night, to spend this day in observation, and return in the evening to an established rendezvous, and mnUo bis report
 It has returned to this place in the moment of the embarkation of the detachment, and informs us that they, this morning, landed at Split Rock, about break of day, within one hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's advance boat, which the ap- proach of day discovered, together with two schooners and six gondolas, all within three hundred yards of them
 He observed on the west shore about forty bateaux, but as there was a thick fog, he could only discover the form of the vessels, a number of fires
 A very heavy morning gun was dis- charged lower down the lake—he thinks at Schuyler's Island
 As this re- port induced the strongest suspicions of the enemy's approach, I thought it my duty to forward it to you as speedily as possible, and shall be proud to receive your commands
 You know the Strength of the garrison by tho last general returns
 If the post should bo invested, which I firmly believe, I much dread we shall suffer for provisions
 I am, dear sir, Your most obedient and ready humble servant, ENOCH POOR

 brought me by express from Ticonderoga
 f also inclose your Ex- cellency a general return of the garrison at that post, dated the 24th instant, by which you will perceive the shameful deficiency in the numbers proper for its defense
1 Artillerists are likewise much wanted
 I always expected six companies; two is as many as can be said to be there
 The bad weather of late has so cut up the roads that the transportation of stores, cannon, and provisions has been extremely delayed
 I am this moment sending expresses to the Eastern States, with a copy of General Poor's letter to each, and a pressing requisition for an immediate reinforcement of men, either by corps of militia or a draught to complete the regiments now at Ticonderoga
 Your Excellency and Congress may be assured that every thing possible for the safety and preservation of that important post shall be attempted—but, at the same time, it is to be wished the means may be found adequate to the end
 GENERAL STSt. Clair * TO GENERAL SCHTJYLER
 TICONDEROGA, June 13,1777
 Dear General:—Here follows the substance of the information given by two men from Canada, taken prisoners by one of our par- ties on Onion Eiver: 1 May 28th, General Poor wrote to General Fellows that the garrison of Ticonderoga consisted uf two thousand two hundred and forty, rank and file
 On the 30th, General Gates inclosed copies of the above letters to the President und Council of the Massachusetts Bay, and added: "The fifteen hundred militia ordered from the County of Hampshire, are not one-third arrived, and from what I hear they are likely to be very deficient
 I beg leave to assure you that there is not a moment to be lost
 The safety of the Northern frontier of the Eastern States requires the spirited exertions of tho powers of Government to save them from invasion
" Sixth of June, the Massachusetts Legislature directed that the various officers in tho counties charged with raising troops bo required to provide the same, by draft if necessary, by the 20th of tho month
 Very little attention seems to have been paid to these orders
 2 General StSt. Clair arrived at Ticonderoga and assumed command on the 12th, the day before tho above letter was written
 He had been instructed by Congress as to the manner of completing the fortifications, and had been assured that the British would transfer the larger part of their forces by water to aid General Howe in taking Philadelphia, which all, including General Washington, thought to he the objective point of the present eam-

 397 That General Burgoyne is arrived in Canada, but has brought no troops with him; that the British army is assembling as fast as pos- sible at St
 Johns; that the light infantry, which they call the flying army, commanded by General Fraser, is already advanced to Point- au-Fer; that the whole army is said to consist of about ten thou- sand men, a part of which, with Indians under the command of Sir John Johnson, and Canadians under Captain Mackay, are to pene- trate the country by the Mohawk River, whilst the rest of the army under General Burgoyne, crosses the lake to attack this place; that their fleet (a particular account of which is in the inclosed letter to General Sullivan) is all in the lake, and we may depend on their being here in a fortnight at farthest
 From the nature and circumstance of the pass granted to one of the two, which I here inclose, and his own account of the manner in which he was sent from Montreal, viz
: to search for plans of the country which he pretended to know were hid at Metcalfs, and his being possessed of a considerable sum of Continental money, and some gold and silver, I have the strongest suspicion of his being a spy,1 and have secured him as such and sent him down to you, both paign, and that to cover that movement a feint would bo mudu towards Ticonderoga
 This the Board of War had received from reliable authoritv
 StSt. Clair was to prepare for the reception of ft small British force, designed to prevent any Eastern troops from being sent to the relief of Washington, and this he was to do behind fortifications erected on ground commanded by eminences within cannon shot
 The British vessels controlled the lakes and the only way he could procure information of the enemy was by send- ing scouts through an almost impenetrable forest lining tho shores of the lakes
 On his way to his post of duty, General StSt. Clair stopped at Albany to confer with General Schuyler
 The instructions of that officer wen; given under date of June 5th
 By those he was informed that " As tho whole of our force in the Northern Department, if collected at Ticonderoga, would not be capable of properly manning the extensive works on both sides of the lake,'' it would be advisable to devoto his first cure to Mount Independence which was the most defensible, and might be made to sustain a seige; that frequent scouts should be kept out as far as Crown Point; that the boom should be strengthened by driving piles, so as to prevent the passing of ves- sels to the smith end of the lake; that as provisions were scarce, great economy should be exercised; that attention should be given to requiring tho men to bfl cleanly in order to preserve their health; and gave him ten thousand dollars for contingent expenses
 1 Amsbury, tho supposed spy, when examined by General Schuyler, con
 firmed the story related to StSt. Clair
 "Ho stated that the British forces were approaching St
 John's, and were to advance under General Burgoyne, and also that a detachment of British troops, Canadians and Indians waa to

398 The StSt. Clair Papers
 that you might have an opportunity to examine him yourself, and that, if you should think of him 03 I do, he might be tried at Al- bany, where, should he be found guilty, the sentence will probably be more adequate to the crime than here; for I find the officer, who lately suffered a spy he had in charge to escape, through grossest misconduct, has been honorably acquitted by a court-martial
 You will likewise find a letter from Colonel Bailey, containing the intelligence brought by two Frenchmen sent down by General Gates
 Though their intelligence differs very materially, they agree penetrate the country by the way of Mohawk River
 He added other par- ticulars respecting the strength and arrangements of the British army, which turned out to be nearly accurate, but of which no intelligence had before been obtained or anticipated; for it h id been a favorite idea with Congress and the Commander-in-Chicf that the British would not operate in force from Canada during the present campaign, but that the troops would be chiefly brought round by water to reinforce General Howe
 Hence the small preparations for the defense of Ticonderoga, and for forming a Northern army

 General Washington commented on this information in a letter to Gen- eral Schuyler, under date of June 20th: "Supposing the plan mentioned in Amsbury's evidence to be true, I can not conceive that it will be in the power of the enemy to carry it into execution; but to provide against all events, I have ordered General Putnam to hold four Massachusetts regiments in readiness at PeeUskill to go up the river at a moment's warning, and to order sloops from Albany, which are to he kept for that purpose
 It does not appear that Burgoyne has brought any reinforcements from Europe
 If this is so, he can not move with a greater force than five thousand men
 He certainly will never leave the garrison of Ticonderoga in his rear; and if he invests it to any purpose, he will not have a sufficient number left to send one body from Oswego and another to cut ofl" the communication between Fort Edward and Fort George
 As the garrison at Ticonderoga is sufficient to hold it against any attack,1 I do not think it politic, under your repri> sentation of the scarcity of provisions, to send up troops to consume what ought to be thrown into the fort I draw a very favorable omen from the intercepted letter to General Sullivan
2 It shows that they despair of carrying their scheme by force, and are reduced to the necessity of having recourse to the arts of flattery, bribery and intimidation
" 1 General Washington did not have a clear conception of the nature of the- works at Ticonderoga, which he thought the enemy would hnvo to assail directly in front, as In former wars; nor did he seem to understand that the troops ordered from Mas- sachusetts had not come in, notwithstanding the representations of General StSt. Clair, and, before him, Generals Gates and Wayne
 2 Amsbury related that before leaving Montreal a Judge Levins had given him a canteen, with instructions to give it to General Sulhvan, whom he supposed to com- mand at Tifonde
nv
ja
 and to request General Sulhvan to remove a false bottom in the canteen, under which he would find a letter
 The bottom was removed, and a letter found as described

 399 in the circumstance of General Burgoyne's arrival; and if these fellows have really been sent by him to see what we are about, there was no method more likely to procure them an easy reception than that of giving an account of the preparations in Canada, and car- rying, or pretending to carry, letters from our friends
 The letter to General Sullivan may, notwithstanding, be genuine, and Ams- bury says it was written by one Michael Shannon
 This name is found upon a separate piece of paper, in a fair hand, which he seemed unwilling to part with, and which I suppose to have been a private signal by which he was to be known upon his return
 If the enemy intend to attack us, I assure you, sir, we arc very ill- prepared to receive them
 The whole amount of Continental troops, fit for duty, is fifteen hundred and seventy-six, rank and file, ex- clusive of Baldwin's artificers and Whitcomb's fifty-two rangers
 Besides these, there are three regiments of Hampshire militia, en- gaged for no particular term, and who go off whenever they please
 One hundred and fifty are gone since last return; two regiments of Massachusetts militia, of two hundred and fifty rank and file, fit for duty, engaged for two mouths from their arrival, three weeks of which with some of them is already expired
 Among the number returned sick there is no doubt but many would be useful in case of necessity, but, at any rate, we can not reckon upon more than twenty-two hundred men
 I am very much concerned to give you this disagreeable detail, but I have something worse to add to it
 We can not increase our numbers by calling in the militia without ruin; for, by the com- missary's return and the account of his weekly expenditure, there is meat for seven weeks only on the ground, and he has no prospect of any supply of salt meat, but from some place near Stillwater, nor of fresh, but by sending to New England for it
 This I have desired to do, but must own I have little prospect of advantage from it; for be assured that, and indeed every other communication, may and will very easily be cut off
 I have heard of some cattle below Crown Point, which I shall send for to-morrow
 The bridge goes on tolerably well, but, indeed, is a very heavy, troublesome job
 The caissons, Colonel Baldwin says, will be all sunk by the end of next week
 In the meantime, I have ordered the floating bridge to be removed to the lower side of them, which will serve as a kind of second boom, and retard at least, if not pre- vent, the enemy's vessels from passing; should they attempt it
 A magazine of wood should be laid in immediately, but how to effect it I know not, as there are no teams here of any kind, and
Page 400

400 The StSt. Clair Papers
 not a stick upon the Mount
 All of the timber for the bridge is hauled out of the woods by hand, and employs a much greater num- ber of men than would otherwise be necessary, and might be employed, and are wanted, for other purposes
 What can the quartermaster mean by leaving this place, where so many works are to be carried on, without so necessary an article as draught-cattle? The tents here are, in general, very bad
 I must beg you, my dear general, to hasten up the new tents, for I shall get no good of the troops here, in any way, whilst they remain in barracks
 Our powder-magazines are in so wretched a state, that I am told near fifty pounds of powder a week is damaged
 In short, every thing is so much out of order, that I will add no more to this list of grievances, than to tell you we have no cartridge paper^ When I write again, I hope to have something more agreeable to entertain you with
 P
 S
 I forgot to mention a paper in which Amsbury's money was wrapped, and is also inclosed; it is blurred and blotted, but you will observe it contains a letter from Eph
 Jones to his brother, dated June 2d, about the time Amsbury left Montreal, and is a cor- roborating circumstance of the fellow's evil design
 I should have called upon the militia1 but for the state of our mag- azine
 Should they come in fast, which I believe they would, they might eat us out before either the arrival of the enemy or the sup- plies
 Please give your direction on this head as soon as possible
 The bateaux are in ruin for want of pitch and tar, which Colonel May says he has often wrote for
 Adams, the other of the prisoners, seems to be an innocent fellow, and whom Amsbury brought off with him without knowing his er- rand; he was taken by Muckay at the Sabbath-day Point
 1" It is evident from General StSt. Clair's letter that it will not bo proper to order up the reinforcement before it is really wanted; for he very judi- ciously observes that they will consume the stores
 I can notconceive what occasions the delay of the 
Massachusetts and New Hampshire Continental troops; I have repeatedly written in the most pressing manner to have them sent on, but in vain

 401 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROOA, June 18, 1777
 Dear General:—Inclosed you have the returns of the troops and stores at this place, all except the clothier's, which is so drained, I thought it needless to ask any from him, as he has almost literally nothing
 Since my last, I have had constant scouts out, but have made no discovery of the enemy, save that four of their vessels are lying about a mile on the hither side of Split Rock; they consist of two ships and two gondolas; and on Friday last a schooner beat up within four miles of Crown Point, but, without landing any of her people or coming Ui anchor, returned down the lake
 Yesterday, about noon, we had two men, who had strolled out of camp without arms, taken by a party of savages, who had stolen down to the roadside by MacIntosh's and the bridge, and concealed themselves in the bushes; they were immediately pursued as far as Putnam's creek, but could not be overtaken; unluckily, however, thev fell in with a scouting party I had sent down to discover the motions of the enemy, but were upon their return, and tired upon them unexpectedly
 The officer is wounded, one man killed and scalped, and one missing, but whether taken or not is as yet uncer- tain
 Another party, that I had ordered to proceed to Point-au- Fer, or wherever the enemy might be, returned last night, on dis- covering a large party of Indians on the east side of the lake, about four miles above Crown Point
 I think of sending to feel their pulse to-night, as I am sure it would be of consequence to give these fellows a drubbing
 I am at a loss to form a jndgment of the design of the enemy
 If they mean to attack us, one would think it indiscreet to put us on our guard by such a trifling affair; and yet I cau not think they could prevail with any number of the savages to come on, unless thev had an army not far off to support them
 Be that as it will, I shall use every precaution possible against surprise, and will en- deavor to penetrate their designs
 The same reason, notwithstand- ing our weakness, still prevails against calling for the militia as when I wrote last, having as yet received no supply of meat, either fresh or salt
 Do you know, sir, any thing about the terms upon which Captain Whitcomb's corps was raised? He informs me that by General Gates's orders he promised his people that they should have the 26
Page 402

402 The StSt. Clair Papers
 same bounty as the troops of the State in which they were raised, notwithstanding they were not part of their quota
 This promise has not been complied with, and they are held by a conditional agreement only, which expires this day
 I shall be able to retain them, however, until you favor them with your answer
 I am making some improvements on the Mount, but that and the Ticonderoga side have such dependence upon and connection with each other that, in my opinion, it will be very dangerous to give up either, and yet it is certain we can not, with our present numbers, hold both
 I design, however, to make the appearance of doing it, and after defending Ticonderoga as long as possible, retreat to Mount Independence
 Our guards are crowded with Tories; they iire dangerous here, and can not be properly tried
 I have ordered them to Albany
 The bridge goes heavily on; the qaissons not all sunk yet, but the timber is almost all cut and in the water
 The officers of the fleet have not received commissions, and are very uneasy about it
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO JAMES WILSON
 TICONDEROGA, June 18, 1777
 Dear Sir:—This is the first time I have wrote to you since I left Philadelphia, and am very sorry to make any complaints, but I am much disappointed in the strength of the garrison and the state of the fortifications at this place
 Instead of their having been improved during the winter, which was expected, they are much worse than when I left them, a very strong abatis, in which the security of Mount Independence chiefly consisted, having been almost entirely burned up in the winter, and a great part of the breastivcrk de- stroyed
 This would be a matter of little consequence should it turn out that the enemy have no designs upon us;1 that, however, is 1"From the enemy's situation in Jersey, collecting their force at Amboy and Brunswick, and from their intentions last fall, confirmed by every piece of intelligence we obtain this spring, it scarce admits a doubt that Philadel- phia is the object in view at the opening of this campaign
 If this be their aim, it appears to mo hijrhly probable, their army being greatly ivduced since the commencement of the last campaign, that they will bring round all the troops from Canada to reinforce those here
 What serves to confirm me in this opinion is the facility with which a junction can be made in this way, the necessity they are under of a reinforcement, and the great security
Page 403

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 403 doubtful, though, by some intelligence I have received, I am induced to think they are meditating an attack
 Should this be the case, I fear they will be but too successful, as our num- bers are greatly unequal to the vast extent of ground we must oc- cupy
 I shall do the best, however, I can, and if they should not be repulsed, I hope to see them so crippled as not to be able to pur- sue their journey
 In serious earnest, this place has been too much neglected, and it is disagreeable enough for a man to see himself in a place from whence a retreat is impossible, with a force insufficient for the defense of it, and that you will readily perceive
 Our works would demand ten thousand men, and I have not more than twenty-two hundred
 I shall endeavor, however, to support both • sides of the lake as long as it can be done, and finally retreat to the Mount
 Men, however, might be got here had we provisions, but we are so short in that article that I dare not call in the militia, as in a couple of weeks they would eat up the whole stock of meat
 We had one man killed and two taken prisoners by a party of In- dians yesterday, within sight of the out guards
 They had con- cealed themselves in the bushes, and rushed snddenly upon some unarmed men, who had strolled out a fishing
 They were immedi- ately pursued, but without success, though their flight was so pre- cipitate that they dropped their packs and blankets
 In their retreat they fell in with a party that had been sent to make discoveries, with whom they exchanged several rounds
 The lientenant that commanded the party and one man are wounded, one killed and scaled, and one missing
 What injury they sustained is not known, but it is probable they must have met with some loss, as they were not more than ten steps distant when thev fired
 Another partv of Indians were discovered last night encamped on the east side of the lake about four miles above Crown Point
 I mean to speak with them to-night, and if we can but give them a dressing it will render them more cautious
 It is hard, with the little information we have, to form a jndg- ment of the enemy's designs
 This is certain, that General Bur- govne has been arrived in Canada for some time, and he has not the command of the lakes gives them against our incursions into Canada
 Under these considerations, I can not help thinking much too large a part of our force is directed to Tieonderoga
 Peekskill appears to mo a much more proper place, where, if the troops are drawn together, they will be ad- vantageously situated to give support to any of the Eastern or Middle States

 come to pass the summer inactive
 Perhaps he may take the troops around to General Howe; certain he will either take them there or bring them here
 My dear friend, if you should not hear from me again, which may probably be the case, remember that I have given you this ac- count of our situation, and do not suffer my reputation to be mur- dered after having been sacrificed myself
 The prospect may clear up yet, for all this
 COUNCIL OF GENERAL OFFICERS, HELD AT TICONDEROGA, ON FRIDAY, THE 20TH OF JUNE, 1777
 Present—Major-General Schuyler, Major-General StSt. Clair, Briga- dier-General Roche de Fermoy, Brigadier-General Poor, and Briga- dier-General Patterson
 General Schuyler requested the council to take into consideration the state of this post, with respect to the number of troops necessary for its defense, the disposition of the troops and mode of defense, the state of the fortifications, and the quantity of provisions that may be depended upon
 The council having taken into their most serious consideration the several matters stated in the first article, are clearly and unani- mously of opinion: First—That the number of troops now at this post and Mount Independence, which are under two thousand five hundred effective rank and file, are greatly inadequate to the defense of both posts
 Second—That both posts ought, nevertheless, to be maintained as long as possible, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores
 Third—That if it should become necessary to evacuate one or the other of the posts, and that it remains in one election which, that it ought to be the Ticonderoga side
 Fourth—That such cannon and stores as are not immediately nec- essary on the Ticouderoga side, be removed without delay to Mount Independence
 Fifth—That the fortifications and lines on Mount Independence are very deficient, and that the repairing the old and adding new works ought to claim immediate attention; and that the engineers be direected to repair and make the necessary fortifications
 Sixth—-That the obstructions in the lake, to prevent the enemy's naval force from getting into our rear, and thereby cutting off" all supplies, or preventing a retreat, if such a measure should unhap-
Page 405

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 405 pily become indispensably necessary, ought to be completed with all imaginable dispatch
 SeventJi—That so much remains to be done effectually to complete the obstructions, that, with the few troops we have, there is no great probability it can be done in less than six weeks
 Eighth—That, although our forces may be adequate to maintain our ground on Mount Independence, yet, unless a sufficient stock of provisions can be thrown in before the arrival of the enemy, we having now only thirty-nine days' provisions of meat kind, we think it would be imprndent to expose the army to be made prisoners by the enemy; and that, therefore, it is prndent to provide for a re- treat; to effectuate which, that all the bateaux now at this post be immediately repaired, and as many as can be spared out of Lake George be brought hither
 Ninth—That a quantity of provision of the meat kind should, if possible, be immediately forwarded from Albany or elsewhere
 Tenth—That immediate application be made to his Excellency General Washington, for a reinforcement to be sent on with all pos- sible expedition

 I arrived here yesterday afternoon, and am now busied in arrang- ing matters a little, that stores may be forwarded with more regu- larity than heretofore
 In a day or two you will receive all the pork and salted beef now at this post, fifty barrels only excepted
 Eighteen barrels are only come from Albany since March last
 When the pork and other articles are sent on, the flour will come in the large schooner only, until you can have more time and spare cattle to transport it from the landing to the saw-mills
 Seven barrels of tar go over to-day, and two of iron, with all the tents that are arrived here, together with four boxes of axes, and about three hundred bushels of peas, and about twenty new bateaux
 These should be carried across the soonest possible, and not suffered to be used
 The remainder will come on from day to day

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROGA, June 24, 1777
 Dear General:—Sergeant Heath, who I sent down the lake to make discoveries, returned last night, and informs me that on Tues- day last he saw two birch canoes going down the lake with sixteen Indians and three white men in them, and supposes it was the party that had done the mischief near the lines the day before
 That from a place near the mouth of Otter Creek, he saw three vessels, under sail, beating up, one at anchor about one mile above Split Rock, and the Thunderer behind it
 From this place he likewise descried an encampment of the enemy on both sides of Gilliland's Creek; that, from the appearance of it, and the extent, he thinks it must contain a great body of men, and that number of smokes arose at a distance back, which he supposes was from the encampment of the Indians
 That on Friday last, from Pointon, he saw twenty bat- eaux come out of Gilliland's Creek, and sail up the lake past the Split Hock towards Ticonderoga; that one of the inhabitants, in whom he could place confidence, informed him that the Indians were very numerous; that they frequently cross to the east side of the lake, and that a party of them had been at his house a few min- utes before his arrival; that he then returned to Otter Creek, where he proposed to have halted to refresh his party, but, on being in- formed that a large party of Indians were at one Briton's, he made the best of his way here
 One of his party this day fell behind a little, and was either taken or deserted; he suspects the latter, be- cause ho both waited for him, and sent back to look for him; that one Webb, another inhabitant, informed him that the enemy had been four or five days at Gillilaud's; that they came up with a vast number of bateaux and some gondolas; that some of the troops come over frequentlv, and say their whole army is there, and that they are only waiting the arrival of the rest of their vessels and stores, when they are to attack this place
 I have no doubt that a party of the enemy arc at Gilliland's, nor that their design is to come here, but not in my opinion to attack, but to harass us, and give confidence to their savages, who, it is more than probable, would not have been prevailed upon to under- take it without being joined by some regular troops
 Were they in force, it is improbable they would waste time at
Page 407

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 407 such a distance, in a part of the country where they can find nothing to refresh themselves; and I do not find that they have made any depredations on the east side
 It is not easy to judge of a force at a distant view of an encamp- ment, and Heath must have been six miles or more distant from that on Gilliland's Point, a distance too great to determine any thing with precision, although l»e had a glass to assist his eye
 Besides, I think the ground is not capable of encamping a great number (for he insists on it they are not on high ground, but upon the beach only), but of this you are a much better judge than I, as I never saw it but once
 Be the matter as it may, I shall endeavor to guard against surprise, and to discover both them and their designs; and, if opportunity offers, feel their pulse a little
 I had all the ground between this and Crown Point, from the lake some distance over the mountains, well examined yesterday with a heavy scout, but they discovered no enemy, nor appearance of any
 Whiteomb says he is certain that there has not been any Indians, but three, in that quarter since the prisoners were taken, and that it was three or four days since these three had been there; so that the Indians said to have been about us were, I believe, the children of a disturbed imagination
 You had an exceedingly bad time to cross the lake, but I hope you got well over, and without any injury to your health, though it must have been exposed, as I doubt if you were not obliged to be out a second night
 I shall write again to you by express the mo- ment I make any farther discoveries
 COLONEL JAMES WILKINSON TO GENERAL GATES

, June 25t/t, 1777
 My Dear General:—I have not as yet, nor shall I in future, omit one opportunity of communicating to you every material occur- rence in our department; if my letters, therefore, should not reach you, do not accuse me of negligence or ingratitude, but ascribe this circumstance to that insatiable gulf, which has ever swallowed up all intelligence cither to or from this
post
 The enemv bv gradual movements, which have been dulv trans- * 4 C J mitted to General Pchuyler, last evening arrived at Crown Point with some vessels and a part of their army, who have encamped on Chimney Point
 We are induced to believe from a morning gun, which was repeated down the lake, that their whole force is at
Page 408

408 The StSt. Clair Papers
 hand, and as they have lately taken several prisoners, and the neigh- boring inhabitants have had free access to this camp, I am persuaded they will obtain a true state of our weakness, which will indubitably precipitate their operations: in which case the post is inevitably lost, for if we risk a battle the inferiority of our numbers (without a miracle, which we sinners have no right to expect) will subject us to defeat and captivity; and if we retire to Mount Independence, the scantiness of our provisions will subject us to reduction by famine, as the enemy, when in possession of this side of the lake, can easily remove the obstructions up the south bay, and by their fleet cut off our communication from Skenesborough
 The militia are at our command, but should we call them in, immediate starvation is the consequence, as General Schuyler has lately assured us that we have no right or reason to expect more than three hundred barrels of meat in addition, and we can not subsist our present small garrison longer than seven weeks with what is on the ground
 The distance from whence our supplies are derived, and the difficulty of trans- portation, both tend to embarrass us
 In this cruel situation what can be done? The most laudable measure, in my opinion, would be to remove our heavy artillery and stores, and the convalescents and invalids of the army, to Fort George
 Being then light and unincumbered, we might, if hard pushed, effect a retreat to that post, which would enable us to check the enemy's progress; on the contrary, should we attempt to support this place in our present de- ficient situation, we lose all, and leave the country defenseless and exposed
 What, then, will there be to obstruct their favorite scheme —a junction by the North River? Nothing that I can discern
 You remember the state of arms I transmitted you on my first arrival here; I am sorry to inform you that they arc not now better in quality, or superior in number
 Our men are harassed to extreme weakness by fatigue, and the strong guards which we are now obliged to establish will in a little time quite break up their spirits and constitutions
 If fortitude, if enterprise, if perseverance or temerity could avail, I would not complain; but, in the name of Heaven, what can be expected from a naked, undisciplined, badly armed, unaccoutered body of men, when opposed to a vast superior- ity of British troops? What can be done, the great StSt. Clair will effect; but such is the weakness of our numbers, that he can not form any plan of defense
 Of the two, I prefer death to captivity; but be the event as it will, I shall not disgrace my acquaintance
 General Schuyler has been here a few days, but is now in Albany

 409 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROGA, June 25th, 1777
 Dear General:—I informed you yesterday that an encampment of the enemy had been discovered at Gillilaud's Creek; last night two of their vessels came up to Crown Point, and this morning there are seven lying at that place; the rest of their fleet is proba- bly but a little lower down, as we hear their morning guns distinctly at different places; they also debarked some troops, and encamped upon Chimney Point; whether they have landed at Crown Point or not, my scout-boat did not discover, not daring to venture far enough down the lake, on account of the shipping; but I have sent out a scout on this side, which, I doubt not, will bring a just ac- count of their situation
 I can not help repeating to you the disa- greeable situation we are in, nor can I see the least prospect of our being able to defend the post, unless the militia come in; and, should the enemy protract their operations, or invest us, and con- tent themselves with a simple stockade, we are infallibly ruined
 I have thoughts of calling for the Berkshire militia, which are nearest to us, and will probably be the most alert to come to our as- sistance, because they are in some measure covered by this post, but on that I shall consult the other general officers
 This, however, is clear to me, that we shall be obliged to abandon this side, and then they will soon force the other from us, nor do I see that a retreat will, in any shape, be practicable
 Every thing, however, shall be done that is possible, to frustrate the enemy's designs, but what can be expected from troops ill armed, naked and unaccoutered? I shall write you again as soon as the scout returns
 GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 SARATOGA, Thursday Morning, June 2tWi, 1777
 Dear General:—Your favor of the 24th was delivered to me last evening
 If the enemy should not mean a furious attack on your post, their movement is probably calculated to cover an attempt on New Hampshire, the Mohawk River, or to cut off the communica- tion between Fort George and Fort Edward, or, perhaps, all these- I wish you, therefore, to keep n, small scout on the east side of the lake, near the road leading from St
 John's to New Hampshire, and others as far west as the road leading to the north branch of Hud- son's River

 I have dispatched an express to Congress, to General Washing- ton, and have entreated the latter to afford us a reinforcement
 Pray let nothing be left at the landing, and the bateaux be brought over as soon as possible, that your retreat may not be cut off, should you be unable to maintain your post
 I can not learn that any troops are arrived at Albany
 I shall hasten to that place to for- ward on whatever I can, and to be in the way to bring up the mili- tia, if necessary
 God bless you, and believe me, etc
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GEXERAL SCHUYLER
 TICOXDEHOGA, June 26th, 1777
 Sir:—This moment I have received information from Hoitc, of Otter Creek, that a large party of Indians and Tories are gone up that creek, supposed to be five hundred, and are designed to cut off the communication by Skeuesborough
 They took a pair of oxen from one of the inhabitants, and drove them about two miles above Middlebury Falls, where they halted the day before yesterday, and killed and dressed the cattle; and it is supposed that to-night they will be at the new road, near Castleton, which is twenty-eight miles from hence, and twelve or fourteen from Skenesborough
 They re- ported that a very large party were gone on the west side of the lake, to fall ujmn Fort George
 They are said to consist of a thous- and Indians and Canadians
 We have also had, just now, another attack at the mills
 We have two men killed, two taken, and two wounded—one mortally
 The scene thickens fast, and Sunday next, it seems, is fixed for the attack on this place
 We must make the best of it we can, and I hope at least to cripple them so as they may not be able to pursue their fortune, should it declare in their favor
 I sent a party down last night to reconnoiter them, who are not yet returned, which gives me some uneasiness
 I hope, how- ever, they are safe, and will bring me some intelligence of conse- quence
 I have some thoughts, if they are not numerous, of attacking them
 If they get the worst, it will oblige them to recall their parties; if not, there will be too many left to become prison- ers
 I have sent to the Grants, to inform them of the Otter Creek party, and to desire that all they can possibly spare of the militia may be ready to march at a minute's warning

 TICONDEROGA, June 28, 1777
 Dear General:—My scout on which I depended much for intelli- gence, is not yet returned, nor, I fear, ever will now
 It consists of three men only, the best of Whitcomb's1 people, and picked out by him for that purpose
 The woods are so full of Indians, that it is difficult for parties to get through
 I shall send off Whitcomb himself presently, for intelligence I must have, although I am very loath to put him upon it, lest he should fall into the hands of the enemy, who have no small desire to have him in their power
 I sent Colonel Warner to the Grants, yesterday, to raise a body of men to oppose the incursions of the savages that are gone by Otter Creek, and have ordered him to attack and rout them, and join me again as soon as possible
 I am very happv to find that the country have been apprised of the march of that party, before Warner got to Skenesborough, as it may probably prevent their success, and may end in their ruin
 We are going on with the necessary works on the Mount as fast as possible, and have removed the most val- uable of the stores and provisions on the other fide
 The bridge is in very little more forwardness than when you left this place, to ap- pearance, though thev tell me that to-day will finish getting timber for it
 The boom
is likewise placed, but very feebly secured for want of rope for the cables
 A party of Bradford's arrived yester- day in good season, and had a pleasing effect upon our people, who, never the most lively or gallant, began to show signs of dejection alreadv
 How they may hold out, God knows, but this has raised their spirits a little
 I could wish that the bateaux were all over POOH, or that you would not send them
 I am extremely apprehen- sive that the enemy will possess themselves of the landing; in which case they may fall into their hands
 We can not venture the teams now without a strong guard, and so many parties as we are obliged to make with the fatigues, will very soon wear down our men
 We can do nothing but form conjectures about the force of the enemy, for I can not find a single person on whom I can depend to venture amongst them for intelligence; but from their manner of beginning the campaign, I conclnde they are either in full force or very weak, and hope, by letting loose the Indians, to intimidate 1 Captain Whitcomb was a noted scout, and was relied on to select men to act as spies, etc

 Dear Sir:— 


 I am this moment favored with a letter of the 25th instant, from General StSt. Clair, a copy whereof I herewith transmit
 Should an accident happen to the garrison of Ticouderoga, and General Burgoyne make a push to gain the south part of the lake, I know of no obstacle to prevent him; compara- tively speaking, I have not a man to oppose him; the whole num- 1 General Sehuyler wrote on the same day to the President of Massa- chusetts Bay, saying: "Our garrison at Ticonderoga is greatly inadequate to the defense of the extensive works on both sides of the lake, and I have unhappily no troops to reinforce them
" "I have written to the committee of Berkshire, and requested them to call upon the adjacent counties and dis- tricts in tlnit State and Connecticut
 Should the militia turn o-
it with spirit, I am in hopes we shall be able to baffle the enemy
" But the militia did not turn out, and nothing was done to aid in defense until after the evacuation of the posts, and the people feared the British more than they regarded their own comfort

 413 her at the different posts at and on this side of the lake, including the garrison's of Fort George and Skenesborough not exceeding seven hundred men, and these I can not draw away from their several stations; in every one of which they are already much too weak
 It is, therefore, highly necessary that a strong reinforce- ment should, without delay, be sent me
 If the sloops are not yet s-ent to bring the troops, your Excellency has ordered to be kept in readiness at Pcekskill, I shall push them off without delay
 As it is not probable that we shall in time be supplied with field pieces from the eastward, I must entreat that the reinforcements may bring some up with them
 I have this moment also received a let- ter from Mr
 Deane, the Indian interpreter, extracts whereof I in- close you
 As the information tallies exactly with what I had be- fore, it leads me to conclude that an irruption will be made from the westward
 I shall apply for the aid of the militia of this and the neighboring States, but I fear it will not be very powerful, as many must be necessarily left at home
 I have received a letter from the Commissary-General, which I think neither so temperate or decent as it should be
 I shall take the first leisure hour to transmit you a copy, with my answer, in which I believe it will be evinced from authentic returns, that the scarcity of provisions in this department is, in a great measure, if not altogether, to be imputed to a want of attention in the persons whose duty it was to supply this depart- ment

 TICONDEROGA, June 30, 1777
—1:30 o'clock
 Dear General:—This morning some of the enemy's gun-boats ap- peared at the Three-Mile Point, when the alarm was given
 We could see them disembark a number of men, and the boats in- creased to eighteen, which are now lying abreast from the hither side of the Point to about half-way across the lake
 The bateaux in which they transported their troops are not come in sight, lying on the far side of the Point, under cover of it

Page 414

414 The StSt. Clair Pdpers
 Soon after their landing, a party, chiefly Indians and Canadians, pushed towards our lines
 As we had a scout down the lake at the time of their arrival, I immediately sent out two parties to support them and bring them off
 The scouts fell in with the enemy, and after a few shots, in which they say some of the Indians were killed, they, being overpowered by numbers, dispersed, and part of them have got in, and I have little doubt but the greatest part of them will yet make their appearance
 It is probable, however, that some of them have fallen into their hands
 "\Ve have had one or two alarms before this, but it was occasioned by their boats coming up near our guard-boats, and their firing upon them
 My people are in the best disposition possible, and I have no doubt about giving a good account of the enemy, should they think proper to attack us; and if the person I mentioned to you in my last pursued the opportunity that now presents itself, they will go back faster than they came on
 He has above a thousand men
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO LIEUTENANT-COLONEL HAY
 [Instructions
] TlCONDEROGA, July 1, 1777
 Sir:—I wish you to go with the party ordered to escort the wag- ons to-morrow to Lake George Landing, and direct the loading of the most valuable and necessary articles first, which will be deliv- ered at the hither landing and embarked on board the scow, which must be sent up for that purpose, and forwarded to this place
 The wagons will then return, and bring what remains to camp, under the convoy of Colonel Cockburn, who I wish to consult with you about every thing necessary
 You will order Captain Hutchins, who commands at the landing, after every thing is removed, or can be removed, to fit out and man- all the bateaux at the landing, or as many of them as his and Lieutenant Lyford's party can manage, and proceed with them to Fort George, taking for the signal of their departure the burning of the block-houses and mills at the hither landing, which you will direct the officer commanding there to exe- cute and retreat to the lines, forming the rear guard for Colonel Cockburn
 I wish as many of Lieutenant Lyford's party to re- turn here as possible; but if the lauding of the bateaux demand them, they must all go, and they and Captain Hutchins' party re- turn to this place by Skenesborough or the lake, as either commu- nication may be open

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROCJA, July 1, 1777
 Dear General:—Xot finding a convenient opportunity to send off my letter, I have the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th
 The success of General Washington over Gen- eral Howe is an event of such importance as must destroy every prospect of the enemy's carrying their plans into execution, should they succeed here
 I have ordered a fen-de-joie upon the occasion, and will find some way to communicate the intelligence to the en- emy
 They have now two ships, eighteen gun-boats, and three sloops, lying off the Three-Mile Point, and they are forming a camp upon the point, and retrenching it
 This does not look like their being strong
 Other matters I hope to manage to-morrow morning, but can not be particular, for fear of accidents
 P
 S
 This moment I have discovered that they are throwing a boom across the river
 Bravo !1 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROGA, July 2, 1777
 Dear General:—Yesterday at noon, in the very instant of the fen-de-joie, which consisted of thirteen pieces of cannon (the mus- ketry might have discovered to the enemy our numbers), forty-one bateaux appeared off the Three-Mile Point, crossed the lake, and landed troops on the east side, in the bay formed behind the Long Point, opposite to the Three-Mile Point
 I observed them verv at- tentively, and am certain they did not contain, en an average, above twenty men
 It is not improbable, however, that part of the troops transported in them from Canada may have landed on the western side, so low down as to be out of our sight, and I am rather inclined to think this the case, from their camp extending a considerable distance down the lake, and its being much too large for the number of men we saw embark at the Point
 1 Tho hope now was that Burgoyne hnd few troops with him iand the great precaution taken in throwing up works gave color to tho theory), in which case the defense of Ticonderoga would seem to bo practicable

Page 416

416 The StSt. Clair Papers
 I am in great pain for the bateaux and stores at the landing
 \Ve can not possibly get them over (the enemy having possessed them- selves of Mount Hope), without risking such large detachments as must oblige us to come to action in the open field, which would not be altogether prudent
 I had ordered a party to bring them off this morning, but the escape of some of the cattle, and the stupid- ity of the drivers, retarded us so much that day appeared, and it was then too late to attempt it
 The design was, therefore, laid aside, and a party sent to reinforce the party at the lauding, with orders to take back the stores to Fort George, and all the bateaux, destroying the block-house and such bateaux as they might not be able to carry off
 At the same time, I sent orders to the block-house at the mills, which has been attacked several times, and was sur- rounded yesterday all day, for the officer to set fire to it and the mills, and to retire to camp, which he has this moment effected
 The party gone over with the boats I have desired to return to Skenesborough
 It will be of the utmost importance to secure that communication, which I have no doubt of your being able to do; and when the Grant people come in, I hope to keep open that by Castleton
 A party of them, with cattle, should have been here yesterday
 I hope no accident has happened to them
 The inhabitants who live between this and the bridge, I found it necessary to bring within the lines, and have now sent them to Skenesborough, with directions to Captain Grey to forward them to Albany by the first opportunity
 I do not know that they are our enemies, but they are certainly not our friends, and when the enemy first presented themselves they were through their houses, and they gave us no intelligence of them
 I am still of opinion that the enemy have no great force here, but whether the whole of their army may as yet come up I am not cer- tain, but last night they fired their evening gun from three different places, further down the lake than their post at Three-Mile Point
 A little time will clear up this matter
 I am not sufficiently ac- quainted with this country to form any judgment how a body of men can be sent out to our relief, in case the enemy possess them- selves of the shores of the lake above Mount Independence, which they certainly will by means of their savages; but if they can be brought by laud in their rear, a small party would oblige them to quit the lake, and consequently leave the communication open

 417 JAMES WILSON TO GENERAL ARTHUR STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHLV, M Juhj, 1777
 My Dear General:—Doctor McKenzie sets out for Tieonderoga; I embrace, with pleasure, the opportunity of writing to vou by him
 Some time ago, the enemy advanced from Brunswick as far as Somerset Court-house
 It is probable that their design was to push for Philadelphia; this, at least, was believed, and the belief pro- duced the best effects
 The militia of New Jersey turned out with the greatest rapidity; and, to a man, the citizens of Philadelphia agreed to suspend their disputes about the Constitution and to join unanimously in every measure proper for repelling the enemy and defending the State
 General Washington kept his strong encamp- ment at Middlebrook
 The Ixxly under General Sullivan, consist- ing of militia and reinforcements of Continental troops from the southward, was increasing very fast at Coryell's Ferry
 General Howe thought it proper to retire from Somerset to Brunswick, from Brunswick to Amboy; and lately, from Amboy to Staten Island
 These different movements have produced frequent skirmishes, with the advantage generallv on our side; once, on that of the enemy, if gaining three field-pieces from us and losing, according to the best account?, a much greater number of men than we lost, can be called an advantage
 Concerning the future views of the enemy the sen- timents expressed here are very different
 Some think they mean to push up the North River; others, that they will make an irrup- tion into New England; others, that they will come round by sea to Delaware; others, that they know not what to do
 Indeed, I think it probable that their plan for the campaign, if they had a plan, is very considerably deranged
 We hear of no reinforcements worth mentioning being arrived from Europe
 As to the polities of Pennsylvania, they are not in the situation I would wish
 If a regular system was formed between General Howe and the friends of our Constitution, his motions could not have been better timed for them than they have been in two dif- ferent instances
 When an opposition has been twice set on foot, and has twice proceeded so far as to become formidable, he has twice, by his marches toward Delaware, procured a cessation
 The Assembly have twice taken advantage of it to promote their ou'n purposes, though those in the opposition generously, and like true patriots, have suspended it, while the approach of the enemy were dreaded
 The Assembly, just before their adjournment, and just after their landable instance of conduct was exhibited, have branded 27

 themselves in a public address to the people, with carrying on their opposition in a manner improper under any government
 They have agreed, however, at last, to take the sentiments of the people with regard to a convention
1 What will be the event, I am un- certain
 They have one useful quality; it would be a virtue if ex- erted for a good purpose
 I mean, industry
 This is much wanted on the other side
 As the sense of the people will not be taken till after the next election, I have some expectation that their eyes may be opened to see their true interest by that time
 I long much to hear from you
 What I intimated to you long ago has happened
 I hope you will be happy
 I know you will be useful at Ticonderoga
 A good correspondence, I have every reason to believe, will subsist between General Schuyler and you
 If he is at Ticonderoga, please to present my compliments to him

 CLAER TO GENERAL SCHUYLER
 TICONDEROGA, July 3, 1777
 Dear General:—Our picket was attacked yesterday two or three times, in which we lost five men killed and two or three wounded
 The enemy's loss we are not apprised of, but we have one prisoner of the Forty-Seventh regiment, and two deserters from the corps of Jagers
 The prisoner was very -sulky, and would give no informa- tion whatever; but by disguising an officer, a countryman of his, and confining him in the same room with him, with the help of a little rum, we got out all he knew, which we have here inclosed, as also the examination of the deserters
 Two men came in from the Grants last night, and returned
 I have wrote very pressingly for the people to come on, and for the present leave the cattle to be brought up by those who succeed them
 I think it is probable Warner will fall in with the foreigners, who are all on the east side at Ticonderoga; the remainder on their march to that distressed post
 It appears to this House from the various information from thence, and the personal acquaintance of many of the members thereof of the particular circumstances which attend our friends there at this present time, that every prudent step ought to be immediately taken for their relief

 THE EVACUATION OF TICONDEROGA AND MOUNT INDEPENDENCE
 At a council of general officers, held at Ticonderoga July 5, 1777, present, Major-General StSt. Clair, Brigadier-Generals Roche de Fer- moy, Poor, Patterson, and Colonel-Commandant Long: General StSt. Clair represented to the council that as there is every reason to believe that the batteries of the enemy arc ready to open upon the Ticonderoga side, and that the camp is very much exposed to their fire, and to be enfiladed on all quarters; and as there is also reason to expect an attack upon Ticonderoga and Mount Independ- ence at the same time, in which case neither would draw any sup- port from the other; he desired their opinion, whether it would be most proper to remove the tents to the low ground, where they would be less exposed, and wait the attack at the Ticouderoga lines— or whether the whole of the troops be drawn over to Mount Inde- pendence, the more effectually to provide for the defense of that post
 At the same time the General begged leave to inform them that the whole of our force consisted of two thousand and eighty- nine effectives, rank and file, including one hundred and twenty-four artificers (unarmed), besides the corps of artillery, and about nine hundred militia, who have joined 115, and can not stay but a few days
 The council were unanimously of the opinion that it is impossible, with our force, to defend Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and that the troops, cannon and stores should be removed this night, if possible, to Mount Independence
 Second—Whether, after the division of the army at Ticonderoga have retreated to Mount Independence, we shall be in a situation to defend that post, or, in case it can not be defended, if a retreat into the country will be practicable
 The council are unanimously of opinion that, as the enemy have already nearly surrounded us, and there remains nothing more to invest us completely but their occupying the neck of land betwixt the lake and the East Creek, which is not more than three quarters of a mile over, and possessing themselves of the narrows betwixt that and Skenesborough, and thereby cutting off all communication

 Sir:—I was honored with your favor of the 2d instant this day
 The exertions of the Convention to reinforce us at Ticonderoga, merit my warmest thanks, though they have been too late to answer the good purpose they intended
 Finding that the enemy were ready for the attack, and it was morally impossible we could main- tain the post with our handful of troops, and at the same time con- sidering how necessary to the States it was to preserve our army, small us it is, it was determined in a council of the general offi- cers that the posts on Ticonderoga and Mount Independence should be evacuated, and a retreat attempted to Skenesborough, by the way of Castleton, and that every thing we could remove, with the sick, should be taken by water to the same place, covered by the armed 1"Soon after I had despatched the letter, which I did myself the honor to address to your Excellency from Stilhvatcr, 1 met with Lientenant-Colo- nel Hay, Deputy Quartermaster General, who was at Ticonderoga
 He in- formed me that on Saturday it had been agreed upon to retreat from Ticonderoga and Mount Independence; that between two and three o'clock on Sunday morning, General StSt. Clair, with the rest of the general officers and the army, marched out of the lines at Mount Independence; that Colo- nel Long, with about six hundred men, embarked aboard our few vessels, and in bateaux; that just before they arrived at Skenesborough they were overtaken by the enemy's vessels and gunboats and were obliged to abandon the vessels, in which we lost all our ammunition

y the army got on their march, unperceived by the enemy, although they were all around us, and should have effected it perfectly, had it not been for the burning of a house, whether from accident or want of thought I can not say, but it served to inform the enemy of our retreat, and a party of them were on the Mount before the whole of our people had got off of it
 They did not attempt, however, to pursue us, 
but only fired a few shots from the heights, which did us no damage
 We pur- sued our route to Castleton, which we reached last night, with the main body, having met on our way a party of the enemy, who had been collecting cattle in the country
 These were immediately dis- persed, and a lew prisoners taken
 Colonel Warner, with about a thousand men, stopped six miles short of Castleton, where he was attacked this morning
 The event of the action I can not as yet ascertain, the accounts are so various from the persons who have come in; but I believe it has been pretty severe on both sides
 I am now on my march to Bennington, which place I am obliged to make on account of provisions, the enemy having last night posses- sed themselves of Skenesborough, of which I got intelligence this morning, which determined me to take the road for that place, and there I beg that the reinforcements coming on by Number Four may be sent, as I shall immediately march from thence for the North River, and endeavor to throw myself betwixt the enemy and the in- habitants, and prevent Mr
 Burgoyne from penetrating into the country
 I must beg that all the flour that can be got may be sent for- ward
 I have wrote to the first commanding officer of the militia to take the shortest road to Benuington, with directions to send the same orders to such others as may be already on this side Number Four

 423 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL SCHTJYLER
 DORSET, 8th, July, 1777
—9 o'clock
 Dear Sir:—About an hour ago I received your favor of yester- day
 I wrote you from Ticonderoga, the night before we left it, to inform you that I intended to march to Skenesborough by way of Cajstleton, and from thence to Fort Edward; but when I got to Castletou I found the enemy were in possession of Skenesborough, which obliged me to change my route
 ()n the march to Castleton, we fell in with a party, commanded by Captain Fraser, who had been collecting cattle in the country
 These were immediately dispersed, and a few prisoners taken; but, being reinforced by a strong detachment from Ticonderoga, they attacked, in the morning, the rear-guard of our army, who had imprndently stopped six miles short of the main body, and were, I believe rather surprised;1 notwithstanding which, they made a very 1 "As soon as General Burgoyne discovered our retreat, 


 he dis- patched Brigadier-General Fraser, supported by Major-General Reidesel and a German corps, in pursuit of the main body
 
 
 
 General Fraser, after a vigorous pursuit, encamped several miles in the rear of Warner, but renewed his march the next morning, and about seven o'clock readied Hub- bardton, just as Warner had paraded his men to follow General StSt. Clair, who was under arms, waiting his arrival, when the firing commenced, which was confined to small arms
 Two militia regiments, which were ex- ceedingly insubordinate and seditious, had, the'preceding evening, taken a diverging path, and encamped three or four miles in our rear
 The first thought of the general was to support Warner by those corps under the com- mand of Colonel Bellows; for which purpose his aids-de-camp, Majors Dunn and Livingston, were hurried off with positive orders and assurances of sup- port, He then ordered the troops to be told off, and the officers posted for action, and he was exhorting them to courageous conduct, when I perceived a manifest repugnance in a corps to turn about and march upon the enemy
 Even one of the brigadiers was open in his opposition to the measure
 In the meantime, Majors Dunn and Livingston met the militia under Bellows, hurrying away from the scene of the action to the main body, and, finding them equally deaf to commands and entreaties, they pushed forward towards the field of buttle, which they had nearly reached, when they met our troops flying from the enemy, and were informed by Captain Chndwick, a gallant officer who had been engaged, that the conflict had terminated, which, be- ing warranted by the cessation of the fire, they returned to the general and made report
 "Colonel Warner was a hardy, valiant soldier, but uneducated, and a stranger to military discipline
 His insubordination at Hubbardton exempli- fies tho danger and misfortunes which attended the disobedience of military commands; for, if he had obeyed the orders he bad received, our corps

 obstinate defense, and, I have good reason to think, killed and wounded a great number of the enemy
 As they were at too great a distance from me to support them, I sent orders to Colonel Warner, who commanded the party, in case he found himself too hard pressed, to retreat to Rutland and join me
 He is not yet come in, though I have heard that he is coming in with about a hundred men; and a great part of the other regiments, except Half's, have already joined us
 I am in great distress for provisions
 If I can be supplied at Manchester, I shall proceed directly for Fort Edward, or Saratoga, as circumstances may direct; if not, I shall be obliged to go to Benuington
 I account myself very happy in effecting this retreat, as the loss of the army, small as it is, would have been a blow that this part of the country would have felt severely, and that must inevitably have happened in a very few days
 Adieu, my dear general; I hope to see you soon, or things in a better train
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO JONAS FAY, SECRETARY STATE OF VER- MONT
 COLONEL MARSHE'S, July 9<A, 1777
 Sir:—I have just now received a letter from General Schuylcr, directing that Colonel Warner's regiment, with the militia of your State, should be left for the protection of the people; and I have by this conveyance wrote to the Colonel to acquaint him thereof
 The General also desires that all the cattle may be drove further down than where it may be thought proper that Colonel Warner take post, and that all the carriages which may be of use to the enemy be brought off or destroyed
 He also desires that all the cattle in condition for killing may be sent out by a safe route to Fort Edward, where he now is with some Continental troops and militia
 A large reinforcement from Peekskill are on their march from Albany to join him, and, if I can be supplied with provision at Manchester, I shall also join him with the utmost expedition, where we shall have force sufficient to check the progress of the enemy
 Your Convention have given such proofs of their readiness to concur in any measure for the public safety, that it woidd be im- pertinent to press them now; I will only repeat the request I made •would have been united, and
 us the discipline of the enemy could have availed them little in a mountainous country covered with wood, we should infallibly have dismembered, and, probably, captured the flower of the Brit- ish army

—Previous to the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst
, I had directed the militia of your State that were with me to remain at Rutland for the protection of the people, until your Convention should direct otherwise, and am pleased to find myself in sentiment with them, and with General Schuyler
 The militia that can be raised in your country will, I think, keep the people in security, for in my opinion they have little to fear except the depredations of a few Indians
 Fort Ann was attacked the day before yesterday, and the enemy repulsed with considerable loss
 [True copy, examined by Israel Allen, Secretary
] GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR BOWDOIN
 MANCHESTER, July 9, 1777
 I have just time to mention the receipt of your obliging letter of the 20th ult
, which eame to hand this moment
 As the evacuating Ticouderaga must have alarmed the country, and raised their curi- osity at the same time, permit me to give you some account of that matter, with the reasons that induced me to propose it to the other general officers
 The garrison consisted of about thirty-three hundred men, of whom two thousand and eighty-nine only were fit for duty, many of those mere boys, altogether incapable of sustaining the fatigues of a soldier, naked and ill-armed, not above one bayonet to every tenth man; the place nearly invested, and their batteries completed; and, from the intelligence of my spies, the investiture was to be completed on Sunday last, the day we left it, when all possibility of retreat or support would be cut off
 The loss of this army, small as it is, was the inevitable consequence, and would have been a very great mis- fortune, much greater, in my opinion, than the loss of the post, as there would have been nothing left for the militia to collect to, in this quarter, to stop the progress of an enemy flushed with con- quest
 I therefore determined to attempt a retreat whilst it was practicable, but previously consulted the other general officers, who were unanimously of opinion that it ought to be attempted without loss of time
 We accordingly prepared for it that night, and having, in the course of the night, embarked as many of our stores and provisions
Page 426

426 The StSt. Clair Papers
 as possible, marched off at break of day
 We should have got off altogether unperceived by the enemy, had it not been for the acci- dental burning of a house, aud the desertion of two men, of the artillery, who, in the hurry, went off with a small boat to the enemy
 The rear of our army evacuated Mount Independence as the front of the enemy entered
 They exchanged a few shots, but did not offer to pursue, which I ascribe to their being the Brunswickers that took possession
 A considerable body, however, were sent up a creek that enters some distance in the country, who, next morning, attacked our rear guard; they defended themselves very well, and, though obliged to retreat, killed and wounded a great many of the enemy; since which we have seen nothing of them
 My design was to have marched to Skeuesborough, but the enemy had got be- fore me, which obliged me to change my route, and bear this way, on account of provisions, which I shall be able to obtain to-morrow, when I shall proceed, with every possible dispatch, to join General Schuylcrat Fort Edward, where I hope we shall soon have an army of force sufficient to stop the progress of Mr
 Burgoyne
' The force of the enemy is seven British regiments, eight foreign ones, and a number of Indians and Canadians
 On the whole, I think myself very happy to make my retreat from under their nose
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS
 FORT EDWARD, 14th July, 1777
 Sir:—Congress may probably think it extraordinary that so much time has elapsed before they heard from me, after a step of so much consequence as the evacuation of the posts that had been entrusted to my care; but it was not in my power to write whilst on the march to this place
 I am sorry to find that my letter to General Schuyler, the night the evacuation took place, has not come to his hands, as, for want of that, though he has, doubtless, informed Con- gress of the event, he could not give them the reasons that induced it—they were these: Seeing the posts of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence were nearly invested, and having intelligence by my spies, that they would be completely so in twenty-four hours, when we should be cut off from the possibility of succor; that the bat- teries of the enemy were ready to open, and the whole of our en- campment on the Ticonderoga exposed to tlusir fire
 Considering, at the same time, the weakness of the garrison; that the effective numbers were not sufficient to man one-half of the works, and that,
Page 427

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 427 consequently, the whole must be upon constant duty, which they could not possibly long sustain, and that, of course, the places with their garrisons must inevitably, in a very few days, fall into the enemy's hands, I saw no alternative but to evacuate them and bring off the army; wherenpon, I called the general officers to- gether, to take their sentiments
 They were unanimously of opinion that the places should be evacuated without the least loss of time; and it was accordingly set about that night, the fifth instant
 After embarking in the boats as much of our cannon, provisions, and stores as was possible, the boats were ordered to Skenesborough, and I sent Colonel Long, an active, diligent, good officer, to take the command there, with his regiment and the invalids, until I should join him with the army, which was to march to that place by the way of Castleton
 The body of the army reached Castleton the next evening, thirty miles from Ticonderoga, and twelve from Skenesborough; but the rear guard, under Colonel Warner, which, with the stragglers and infirm, amounted to near twelve hundred, stopped short of the place six miles, and were next morning at- tacked by a strong detachment the enemy had sent to hang on our rear and retard our march
 Two regiments of militia, who had left us the evening before, and halted about two miles from Colouel Warner, were immediately ordered to his assistance, but, to my great surprise, they marched directly down to me; at the same time I received information that the enemy were in possession of Skenes- borough, and had cut off all our boats and armed vessels
 This obliged me to change my route, that I might not be put betwixt two fires, and, at the same time, be able to bring off Colonel War- ner, to whom I sent orders, if he found the enemy too strong, to re- treat to Rutland, where he would find me to cover him, that place lying at nearly equal distances from both
 Before my orders reached him, his party was dispersed, after having for a considerable time sustained a very warm engagement, in which the enemy suf- fered so much that they pursued him but a small distance
 Our loss I can not ascertain, but believe it does not exceed forty killed and wounded
 About two hundred of the party joined me at Rut- land and since, but great numbers of them are still missing, and I suspect have gone down into New England by the way of Number Four
 After a very fatiguing march of seven days, in which the troops suffered much from bad weather and want of provisions, I joined General Schuyler the twelfth instant
 It was my original plan to retreat to this place, that I might be
Page 428

428 The StSt. Clair Papers
 between General Burgoyne and the inhabitants, and that the militia might have something round which to collect themselves; it is now effected, and the militia are coming in, so that I have the most sanguine hopes that the progress of the enemy will be checked; and I may yet have the satisfaction to experience that, by abandoning a post, I have eventually saved a State
 Perhaps I may be censured by those who are unacquainted with the situation I was in for not sooner calling the militia to my assist- ance
 I think I informed Congress that I could not do that for want of provisions; and as soon as I got a supply I did call for them, and was joined by near nine hundred the day before the evacuation; but they came from home so ill-provided that they could not, nor would not, stay with me but a few days
 The two Massachusetts regiments of militia likewise, which composed part of the garrison, gave me notice that their time expired in two days, and then they intended to go home
 In vain did I beg of their officers to exert every influence they had over them, and from their subsequent behaviour, I am fully persuaded the officers were most to blame
 They kept with me, however, for two days; but their conduct was so licentious and disorderly, and their example begin- ning to affect the Continental troops, I was constrained to send them off
 Inclosed you will find a copy of the council of war, in which is contained the principles upon which the retreat was undertaken
 As I found all the general officers so fully of opinion that it should be undertaken immediately, I forbore to mention to them many cir- cumstances which might have influenced them, and which I should have laid before them had they been of different sentiments; for I was, and still am, so firmly convinced of the necessity as well as the propriety of it, that I believe I should have ventured upon it had they been every one against it
 I have the utmost confidence in the candor of Congress, and persuade myself that, notwithstanding the loss they have sustained, when they have impartially considered I was posted, with little more than two thousand men, in a place that required ten thousand to defend it; that these two thousand were ill-equipped and worse armed (not above one bayonet in ten, an arm essential in the de- fence of lines); that with these two thousand I have made good a retreat from under the nose of an army at least four times their numbers, and have them now between the country and the enemy, ready to act against them, my conduct will appear, at least, not de- serving of censure

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 FORT EDWARD, llth July, 1777
 Sir:—Your Excellency's letters of the 12th and 13th instant,1 to General Schuyler, have been by him communicated to me
 Con- sidering that my letter to him of the 5th, the day before I left Ti- conderoga, was not delivered, and one I wrote to him whilst on the march to this place has miscarried, and that your Excellency has had no intimation of the motions and destination of our army, I do not wonder that you should have some doubts about the propri- ety of my conduct, though it gives me a very painful sensation to know myself, but for a moment, the subject of a doubt with you
 I have, however, the strongest hopes, when your Excellency comes to be fully informed of our situation and force, you will not con- demn me; and, although I am not solicitous about the opinion of the world (though very far from disregarding it), I wish to hold a character with your Excellency something more than merely nega- tive
 Returns of the strength of my garrison were regularly trans- mitted to General Schuyler, and by him, no doubt, to you
 By them, your Excellency will see that our force consisted of little more than two thousand effectives
 "With these, I had lines and redoubts of more than a league in extent to defend
 Jndge how poorly they could have been defended by these numbers, had they been per- fected, which they were very far from being
 In fact, they were not defensible at all from the Ticonderoga side, unless the enemy would have been so complaisant as to attack us in front of the old French lines, and take no notice of the flunks of them, which were both open
 We had, last year, nine thousand men at these posts, 1" It is astonishing, beyond expression, that you have heard nothing of StSt. Clair and the army under him
 I am totally at a loss to conceive what has become of them
 The whole affair is so mysterious that it oven baffles con- jecture
"— Washington to Schuyler, July 13tt
 "Joined to the unfortunate reverse that has taken place in our affairs, I am happy to hear that General StSt. Clair and his army are not in the hands of the enemy
 I really feared they had been prisoners
"— Washington to Schuyler, July 15th
 If tho evacuation had not taken place, StSt. Clair and his troops would have been prisoners—the thing Washington most feared

Page 430

430 The StSt. Clair Papers
 and they were found barely sufficient for the defense of the works
 The system was a little altered this season, but not so as to make a smaller number answer, but to make a greater number necessary
 The enemy had nearly invested us, nothing being wanted to com- plete it but their occupying a narrow neck of land betwixt East Creek and the lake, on the Mount Independence side
 This, I had information, would certainly take place in the course of the next twenty-four hours, and had been left open so long only with a view to intercept any cattle that we might bring in from the country, and then our communication would have been effectually cut off
 We could have received neither supplies of provisions nor reinforce- ments; for, depend upon it, Sir, the militia of this country can not yet be brought on to raise a siege
 But it may be asked why I had not called in the militia to assist in the defense of the posts? For this plain reason—I had not provision for them, and very little pros- pect of an effectual supply
 When I first had notice of the ap- proach of the enemy, there was no more than ten days' provisions in store for the troops then upon the ground
 To have called in the militia in that situation, would have been certain nun
 So soon as a supply arrived, although but a scanty one, I did call for them, and about nine hundred joined me the day before the resolution to evacuate the posts was taken
 They had come out in such a hurry, and almost entirely without clothes, they did not propose to remain but a very few days at the utmost
 The term of Leamed's and Wells' regiments, which made part of the garrison, expired also in two days, and the commanding officers had acquainted me that they could not prevail upon the men to remain beyond the time they were engaged for
 Your Excellency knows, but too well, the dispo- sition of these people on such occasions
 The batteries of the enemy were ready to open in three different quarters, and our whole camp, on the Ticonderoga side, was exposed to the fire of each; and, as soon as they did open, every man I had must have been constantly on duty, as, from our weakness, of which the enemy could not be ignorant, I had reason, every moment, to ex- pect an assault
 Jndge, Sir, how long we could have sustained it, or whether our resistance must not have been a very feeble one in- deed, especially when you take into the account that a great num- ber were mere boys, and that not more than a tenth part were fur- nished with bayonets
 Revolving these circumstances in my mind, I was at no loss to determine what part I ought to take; but I thought it prndent to take the sense of the other general officers
 A copy of the council has been transmitted to your Excellency by
Page 431

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 431 General Schuyler
 They were unanimously of the opinion that the posts ought to be evacuated immediately; wisely, in my judgment, considering that a retreat, even with the loss of our cannon and stores, if it could be effected, would be of infinitely greater service to the country, and bring less disgrace upon our arms than an army, although a small one, taken prisoners, with their cannon and stores
 I was fully in sentiment with them, and believe I should have or- dered the retreat, if they had been of a contrary way of thinking
 But here, again, it may be asked why, when I found myself in the situation I have described, I did not retreat sooner, when every thing might have been saved
 I have only to answer that, until the enemy sat down before the place, I -believed the small garrison I had to be sufficient
 The intelligence that Congress had received, that no serious attempt in that quarter was intended, as it gained credit with them, I never doubted, and was unwilling to be the oc- casion of drawing off any part of your army, as your operations might thereby be rendered less vigorous; and I knew, too, that you could ill spare them
 Besides, until the case became so urgent that I had no alternative but the evacuation of my posts, or the loss of the army, it did not lie with me to determine upon
 The retreat was begun a little before day, on the 6th instant, unperceived by the enemy, after having embarked as much of the stores and pro- visions, and as many of the cannon as was possible in the course of one very short night; and our march would probably have been unperceived for some time, if General Fermoy's house had not been set on fire
 How that happened, I know not
 I had previously given orders against burning any of the buildings, that our march might be the longer concealed; but it served to the enemy as a sig- nal of our leaving the place, and, in consequence, they were upon- the Mount before our rear was clear of it, and fired a few times upon it, but without effect
 Colonel Long,1 with his regiment and a detachment from the other regiments, and the invalids with the hospital, were sent to 1Pierse Long, a shipping-merchant, of Portsmouth, N
 H
, where he was born, in 1739
 Ho was a delegate to the Provincial Congress in 1775, and Colonel of the First New Hampshire Regiment 1776
 He performed the part assigned him by General StSt. Clair upon the occasion of the evacuation of Ticonderoga, faithfully, and repulsed the pursuing enemy successfully
 Ho was a delegate to Congress 1786-89; delegate to the State Constitutional Convention in 1788, and was the first Collector of the port of Portsmouth, appointed by President Washington
 He died while the incumbent of the office, April 3, 1789

 Skeuesborough by water; while I took the road to the same place, through Castleton, with the body of the army
 As the enemy were at least four times my numbers, I had nothing for it but a forced march, and I pressed it as much as possible, and reached Castleton that night, thirty miles from Ticonderoga, having, on our way, fallen in with and dispersed a party of the enemy, from whom we took twenty head of cattle, three British prisoners, and five Canadians
 The rear-guard, under Colonel Warner, which, with those that had failed lIJKHI the march, amounted to a thousand, imprudently halted six miles short of Castletou, and wasted so much time in the morning that they were overtaken and surprised by a strong detach- ment from Ticonderoga, which had lxx>n sent up the East Bay, which runs into the country very near the plaee where he was
 They sustained the attack with great bravery, but were finally obliged to give way, with the loss of about fifty killed and wounded
 On the first of the firing, I sent orders to two regiments of militia, who had left me the night before, and were lodged within two miles of Colonel Warner's post, to move up to his assistance, which, had they done, that party would have been cut off
 But, instead of that, they made all possible haste to rejoin me, and, at the same instant, I received the account of the enemy's being in possession of Skenesborough, and having taken and destroyed every thing that had been sent there
 I was then constrained to change my route, both that I might avoid being put between two fires, and that I might be able to bring off Colonel Warner
 I, therefore, sent him orders to retire to Rut- land, where he would find me to cover him
 A considerable part of his detachment joined me at that place, and he, with about ninety more, two days afterwards, at Manchester
 A great many are still missing, though few, I believe, have fallen into the enemy's hands, as they did not pursue Colonel Warner but a very small dis- tance, and, from all accounts, suffered much in the action
 The Ninth Ilcgiment followed Colonel Long towards Fort Ann, and were almost entirely cut off
 I have dispatched officers to Bennington, and Number*Four to pick up the stragglers, who, I suppose, have taken these routes to New England; and, on the 12th instant, I joined General Sehuyler at this place, after a very fatiguing march
 Thus, Sir, I have laid before you, without the least reserve, every thing I can recollect respecting Ticonderoga, and the retreat from thence
 Happy should I be if my conduct therein meets with your approba- tion; and I can, with the strictest truth, affirm I was actuated by
Page 433

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 433 no motives but what sprang from a sincere regard for the public welfare
 GENERAL SySt. Clair TO JOHN JAY
 MOSES'S CREEK, July 25th, 1777
 Sir:—General Schuyler was good enough to read to me part of a letter he received last night from you
 I can not recollect that any of my officers ever asked my reasons for leaving Ticouderoga; but, as I have found the measure much decried, I have often expressed myself in this manner: "That as to myself I was perfectly easy; I was conscious of the uprightness and propriety of my conduct, and despised the vague censure of an uninformed populace;" but had no allusion to an order from General Schuvlcr for my justifica- tion, because no such order existed
 The calumny thrown on General Schuyler, on account of that matter, has given me great uneasiness
 I assure you, Sir, there never was any thing more cruel aud unjust, for he knew nothing of the matter until it was over, more than you did at Kingston
 It was done in consequence of a consultation with the other general officers, without the possibility of General Schuyler's concurrence; and had the opinion of that council been contrary to what it was, it would nevertheless have taken place, because I knew it to be im- possible to defend the post with our numbers
 In my letter to Congress from Fort Edward, in which I gave them an account of the retreat, is this paragraph: "It was my origina design to retreat to this place, that I might be betwixt General Burgoyne and the inhabitants, and that militia might have something in this quarter to collect to
 It is now effected, and the militia are coming in, so that I have the most sanguine hopes that the progress of the enemy will be checked, and I may have the sat- isfaction to experience that, although I have lost a post, I have eventit- ally saved a State
" Whether my conjecture is right or not, is uncertain; but, had our army been made prisoners, which it certainly would have been, the State of New York would have been much more exposed at present
 I proposed to General Schuyler, on my arrival at Fort Edward, to have sent a note to the printer to assure the people he had no part in abandoning what they considered their strongholds
 He thought it was not so proper at that time, but it is no more than what I owe to truth and to him to declare that he was totally unac- quainted with the matter; and I should be very glad that this let- 28

 ter, or any part of it you may think proper to communicate, may convince the unbelieving
 Simple unbelief is easily and soon con- vinced, but, when malice or envy occasions it, it is needless to at- tempt conviction
 JOHN JAY TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 KINGSTON, 28th July, 1777
 Sir:—Your letter of the 25th of July, which does no less honor to your candor than justice to the reputation of General Schuyler, was very acceptable
 Agreeably to what I apprehended to have been your intention, I have sent it to the press, and flatter myself the purposes for which it was written will be fully answered
 The evacuation of Ticonderoga was an event very unexpected, as well as important, and has given occasion for much speculation and discontent
 How far it was necessary or prudent can only be de- termined by gentlemen acquainted with the forts, grounds about them, and strength of both parties, and many other circumstances essential to a proper discussion of that subject
 I hope the expedi- ency of the measure may, contrary to general expectation, derive proof from the event; and that the determination of the general officers on that head may, on inquiry, be found undeserving the censure it at present meets with
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR JAMES BOWDOIN
 CAMP AT MOSES'S CHEEK, Jubj 28, 1777
 (About Five Miles below Fort Edward
) Sir:—I sec, by the Boston paper, that you have given my letter1 to the public; though I am sorry to see, at the same time, some very illiberal reflections upon it
2 It is often the lot of people in 1 Letter dated from Manchester, ninth of July, giving hurriedly sn ac- count of the evacuation
 It was printed in "The Boston Gu:Me and Country Journal" 2 The editorial comments were such as able editors are wont to make on ex parte evidence when impressed that their journals are the palladium of the liberties of the people
 "Notwithstanding what has been said of the small number of our troops there," said the Oazctte, "we have ground to believe, upon authority of gentlemen of capacity and character, and who had the best opportunity of knowing, that there were upwards of four thousand effective men in the garrison
" Having thus, upon anonymous
Page 435

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 435 trust to meet with censure where they have really merited praise, if events have not answered the public expectation
 I do not pre- tend to say whether this was my case or not; but it is very un- generous to take it for granted that it was otherwise
 However, the public, I hope, will be soon satisfied in a more eligible method than discussing the matter through the channel of a newspaper, which is seldom a proper one; in the present instance highly imprudent, as it lays our weakness open to the enemy, and if the Generals arc blameless, destroys the public confidence in them, and may go a great way towards having the same effect upon the army
 I thank God this has not yet happened with the army, who are so perfectly sensible of the integrity and propriety of my conduct, that the field and other officers have, almost to a man, (although they were not consulted upon the evacuations), declared if I was censured for the measures I had taken, that they would quit the service
 I knew the genins of them too well to intrust them with a design, the suc- cess of which depended entirely upon the secrecy with which it was executed
 This may look like a reflection upon the officers; but there is so much familiarity betwixt them and the soldiers, that there is nothing comes to their knowledge but is very soon after in every quarter of the camp
 The colonel who complained so bitterly of his marching two days in the rear is Marshall, and has sent his correspondent a parcel of infamous falsehoods

 We brought off with us some cattle that had arrived the day before; and we took twenty from a party of the enemy the first day's march
 A man that can not live two or three authority, disproved the statement of the commanding general, and con- victed the muster officers of false returns, the editor wants to know why (the enemy being known upon the same undoubted authority to be less than six thousand) a "pass, exceedingly strong by nature, and greatly fortified by art, should have an army to defend it equal in number to the assailants?" And judgment is at onco pronounced against the Generals
 What matter if the post, instead of being a strongly fortified pass, consisted of irregular breastworks very extensive, and indefensible except by having fifteen thousand men to man the lines; and that ti e enemy were in possession of heights overlooking these completely, were such fuels to stand against the "authority of gentlemen of capacity and character?" 1A correspondent of the Gazrttt, writing from Manchester, claimed that he held a command at Ticonderoga; that he received no warning to leave, and that he "marched in the rear of the army for two days and nights with- out victuals or drink, except brook water
" These falsehoods were exposed in a caustic communication to the Gazelfc, by Colonel Wilkinson

 days on plenty of good beef is very unfit for a soldier
 It, perhaps, does not become uie to say it, but the retreat was made in as orderly and soldier-like a manner as was possible with raw, undis- ciplined troops
 As to the attack upon Colonel Warner, who com- manded the rear-guard, he halted, without my knowledge, six miles short of Castleton; which was the place marked for the halt of the whole army that night
 At such a distance, it was impossible for me to support him; but the moment the firing began I ordered Bellows' and Alcott's regiments of militia, who had left me the night before and halted two miles from Colonel Warner, to move up to his assistance
 Had they obeyed my orders, it is probable the enemy might have been repulsed; though we now know the party that attacked him consisted of two thousand men, composed of the grenadiers and light infantry of the army, commanded by General Fraser
 The inquiries about the arms of the troops I should think General Heath could very well satisfy
 He must know in what situation he sent them off, and whether they were clothed or not
1 Public jealousy is a virtue; but it may be carried to an extreme, and then it becomes a vice
 If it is not vicious, it is extremely un- caudid, to condemn a man upon mere assumption, when they have neither proper information, nor, it may be, are capable of forming a judgment upon military matters
 However, I bear all the abuse that is very plentifully poured forth upon me, with as much sang froid as possible, happy in the consciousness of my own innocence, and a full persuasion that my character and conduct will soon be put in its true point of view, as I have demanded an inquiry both from General Washington and Congress
 I must own, however, that I am hurt by the accusation of treachery
 As to want of spirit, no man in command that wanted spirit ever possessed the confidence of his troops; and in that respect I am bold to say, I have always been fortunate enough to be both beloved and respected
 I beg pardon for troubling you with so much about myself; but the first painful sensation undeserved-censure occasions is not yet quite worn off; and I have given you the former detail, that you might 1"I join the view in thinking there ought to bo nn inquiry nftor the arms and clothes you mention, for they really never reached Ticonderoga; though your interrogations on that head are improperly directed mid maliciously pointed
 "Believe me, sir, if virtue or justice has existence, the man who stands condemned for retreating from Ticonderoga, will, ere long, be thanked for the salvation of three thousand men, who, instead of being in captivity, are now opposing our enemy

 437 be able to make some answer to well-meaning people, who may be glad to be truly informed
 The numbers, however your people may be imposed upon, will be found exactly as I stated them; as I have been lucky enough to save not only the general returns, but those of the individual regiments, under the signature of their respective Colonels; though I don't know whether I mentioned three regiments of militia, making about nine hundred men, officers inclnded, who joined me the night before I left Ticonderoga, but who did not pro- pose to stay more than two or three days at the utmost; nor that two militia regiments of your State, which composed part of my garrison, were to leave me the day I retreated, their times being ex- pired, and they could not be prevailed on to stay any longer
 We are here tolerably posted, waiting the approach of the enemy, though far inferior in numbers
 It was found necessary to dismiss one-half of the militia on account of the harvest; and a great part of the remaining half have followed them
 Those from Connecti- cut are gone, to a man; but in a day or two we shall be joined by General Glover's brigade, when we shall be able to make some head, if the enemy should come on in force, which I think they dare not venture, as Colonel Warner has now a respectable body at Man- chester, which may fall either upon their rear or flank
 The am- munition was, every ounce, sent off from Ticonderoga, and as much of the provisions as we had boats for; but a great part of the ammunition fell into the hands of the enemy by the vessel on board of which it was unluckily running aground
 Colonel Long deserves all the praise he receives
 He is an active, vigilant, brave officer
 I beg the favor that you will present my best compliments to Mrs

 COLONEL THOMAS HARTLEY TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 CAMP HOWELL'S FERRY, NEW JERSEY, July 31, 1777
 Dear General:—Your friends here are very sorry you have been so ill-supported in the Northern Department
 Your garrison was too small to maintain the important pass of Ticonderoga
 A few battalions of your Southern friends, who served with you the last campaign, might have been of consequence
 It is the practice of the world to censure our misfortunes and point out defects, when the censurer would not have acted so well had he been in the same situation
 I believe but few gentlemen in the army blame you,1 1 It is not practicable to find room fur all of the messages of indorsement

 but the pen of the malignant and envious has been made use of against you
 Some of their performances I send you in a newspa- per
 Were you present, many doubts could be cleared up
 It is cruel to asperse the character of such a gentleman, at such a dis- tance, unheard
 So much noise has been made that you will doubt- less think it prudent to have a public examination
 As you have some enemies, you can not be too careful in having any facts alleged well attested, as you are conscious yourself of having acted for the best
 I hope you will not be uneasy
 Should the army march to- ward Philadelphia, some of your friends will make a few queries
 We have, as yet, no certain intelligence of the place where the fleet has sailed to, but suppose it to be southward
 If they attempt Philadelphia we shall be apt to finish the campaign with them there
 I make no doubt you will be able to stop the approach of Burgoyne and his savages
 GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 ALBANY, August Dili, 1777
 Dear Sir:—The situation of affairs in the western quarter will detain me1 at least until to-morrow
 Fort Schuyler [Stanwix] is in- vested, and has been for some days
 I can not learn that a man is moved from the Massachusetts or Connecticut to our assistance,2 although they are preparing to come
 and good-will sent to StSt. Clair at this time by the best soldiers of the differ- ent armies
 The following, however, under date of July 23, from the "General Hospital," deserves a place: Dear Sir:—I received yours of the 20th inst
 I am very happy you made your escape in time from Tieonderoga, as I am well assured from the small number of tnops you had under your command, you must have fallen a victim to British barbarity
 Let the censorious rabble talk as tluiv please, lam happy you don't give yourself any uneasiness about them
 You have your enemies, but you have friends innumerable; friends that at any time would willingly share your fate
 Your sincere friend, SAML

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO JOHN HANCOCK
 PHILADELPHIA, August 25th, 1777
 Sir:—Your letter of the 5th, inclosing a resolve of Congress of the 30th of July,1 I had the honor to receive at Stillwater, and in consequence thereof repaired to headquarters
 However disagreeable it was to be obliged to leave the army at so critical a time, it gave me pleasure that Congress had determined to inquire into my conduct
2 My character will thereby be placed in its true light, and a stop put, I hope, to that tide of popular abuse that has run high upou me, and been kept up by very disin- genuous and base means
 I beg, sir, that you will make my request to Congress that the in- quiry be ordered immediately3—you must be sensible that, until it is over, my situation is a very awkward one

General St
 Clnir, who commanded at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, be, and he is hereby directed forthwith to repair to headquarters
—Journals of Congress
 General Washington to General Putnam, 9th August, 1777: "Congress have thought proper to call down General Suhuyler and Gen- eral StSt. Clair, to give an account of the causes of our misfortunes to the northward, and General Gates goes up to take the command
" 2General Washington to President of Congress, 9th August
 1777: "I perceive by the resolves for recalling Generals Schuyler and StSt. Clair, that they are directed to repair to headquarters
 I also find that a com- mittee had been resolved on, to digest a mode for inquiring into the reasons for evacuating Ticonderoga and Mount Independence, and into the conduct of the general officers in the Northern Department at the time of t
he evacu- ation
 As these gentlemen have received the letter upon this subject by this time, and will probably be down in the course of a few days, I shall be glad to be informed what I am to do with them when they arrive
 I may be then at a great distance from this, and, in such case, should be at a loss what to say, or how to conduct myself respecting them, without receiving some directions, which I request to be favored with by the earliest oppor- tunity

 COLONEL WILKINSON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, VAN SCHAICK'S ISLAND, September 7th, 1777
 My Dear Sir:—Your agreeable and very satisfactory favor of the 26th July, has just reached me
 I am not at all astonished at the long faces made you, but I very mueh wonder how they are able to make any face; for I think the man who can sustain the eye of the person he ha* much injured, is devoid of both sensibility and candor, and I much fear our councils are not exempt from such characters, else not one moment's hesitation could be made as to the mode of inquiring into your conduct
 I am distressed and enraged to observe in the public prints, which you must have seen, a letter from General Schuyler to the Council of this State, wrote at Fort Edward previous to our joining him, in which he reprehends the evacuation of Ticouderoga, and asserts that the garrison was five thousand strong
1 What a strange du- plicity of heart does he manifest
 He yesterday informed me, "that he had written to Mr
 Duane, dexl ring him to publish tlie same, that you ought not to IK; blamed for not leaving Ticonderoga earlier, but he had not left that in your power; and so far was he from condemning your conduct, that he heartily applauded it, and should, had he been in your situation, have pursued the same steps which you did
" This palpable contradiction to his letter did he utter to me
 Make what use of it you can, and be assured I shall be ever willing and ready to support it
 I wonder public inquiries had not been made into preceding public misfortunes—such as the loss of Fort Washington, a division being surprised and losing three pieces of artillery, etc
 However, God's will be done
 I trust the period is not very distant when justice will be done us, and many will be reduced to their former nothingness
 Affairs in this quarter wear the most favorable aspect
 The Ben- mined should not be done
 It was their purpose to drive both Generals StSt. Clair and Schuyler out of service
 The hitter became disgusted, and ex- changed the army for Congress
 St
 Clnir, however, was kept busy in the Bold by General Washington, nnd had the satisfaction of serving his coun- try despite the malcontents
 The inquiry was not granted until compelled by a majority of Congress under the leadership of Gouverneur Morris

 441 nington success1 has relaxed Mr
 Burgoyne's ardor, and has left him less than thirty Indians, the rest having returned home
 Since that event he has remained stock still, with his advance on the heights op- posite Saratoga, and his main body at Fort Miller
 His army, after a moderate deduction for his losses and war posts, can not exceed five thousand five hundred men
 General Lincoln is at Manchester, to co-operate with this army, with a body of five thousand men, which rapidly increases
 I doubt whether this motion will not make an alteration in Mr
 Burgoylie's front; however, if this should fail, I am sensible we shall find no little efficacy in advancing on the 10th inst
 from this quarter with upward of seven thousand combatants eager for action
 As they tell us, seriously, that the General is de- termined to advance at this period and give the enemy battle as soon as he can do it on equal ground, the affair must be soon settled; and I really think our numbers and disposition will give us a vast ad- vantage, nay, insure victory
 God alone knows when General Schuyler will come down to you

 General Gates begs to be remembered to you, and wishes you here
; so does every officer who has had the honor to serve under you, except the famous Marshall, whom I have tried, and now let you know, as I have the army and his country, that he is not only a scoundrel, but an infamous poltroon
 The shocking degeneracy of mankind, and the poor prospect I have of ever being united with the amiable girl3 in whom my whole soul delights, disgusts me with existence, and will justify me, on the first honorable occasion, in withdrawing from the public service, and seeking that retirement more conducive to real happiness
 May the Almighty bless you, my dear friend

 2General Schuyler, Brigadier-Generals Poor, Patterson, and Fermoy, had been ordered by Congress, August 1st, to repair to headquarters
 On the 4th August, by direction of Congress, General Washington had directed General Gates to assume command of the Northern Department
 The or- der of the 1st, so far ut it directed the brigadier-generals to repair to head- quarters, wns afterward rescinded on account of protest of General Wash- ington
 •After the capture of Burgoyne, when Wilkinson was dispatched by Gen- eral Gates to apprise Congress of that happy event, he called on his amiable girl en route, for which Samuel Adams moved that he be voted a pair of spurs
 It is presumed that Wilkinson took a less melancholy view of the world thenceforth

 has lately received letters from Generals Burgoyne and Fraser re- specting the prisoners made at Bennington
 Burgoyne, in addition, complains of the inhumanity of our troops to his Royal Provincials, and says, "if you mean to avoid the horrors of retaliation, you must severely reprehend and strictly prohibit such conduct in fu- ture," or of his vengeance be assured
 Burgoyne's complaint is ridiculous; his threat contemned
 COLONEL WILKINSON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 CAMP BEMIS'S HEIGHTS, September 21st, 1777
 My Dear General:—On the 10th inst

 General Burgoyne ad- vanced from Saratoga to Sword's house, aud encamped on the heights west of the river; on the 17th and 18th, he was engaged in repairing the bridges in his front
 Early on the 19th, he struck his camp and advanced toward our left
 Morgan's rifle regiment, aud a corps of two hundred and eighty of Major Dearborn's light infantry, were immediately de- tached to discover their motions aud harass their advance
 About a mile from camp, and at half after twelve, they fell in with a picket of the enemy, which they immediately drove, but, the enemy being reinforced, after a sharp fire they were in turn obliged to retire
 This skirmish drew the main body of the enemy and Poor's brigade from our camp to support the action, which, with a short cessation, was renewed with redoubled energy and violence, and continued in- cessant till the end of the day, when our people retired to camp, and the enemy a small distance in rear of the field
 Keinforcemcuts which were occasionally detached amounted in all to nine regiments, two of them militia; though Morgan's, Scammel's, Cilley's, and Hale's, of General Poor's brigade, who all behaved inimitably, sus- tained the principal fire
 We are indisputably assured that Bur- goyne, who commanded in person, was wounded in the left shoul- der ;1 that the 62d regiment was cut to pieces, and that the enemy suffered extremely in every quarter where they were engaged
 I inclose, you a return of our loss aud made prisoners during die ac- tion [amounting to three hundred and twenty-one killed, wounded, and missing]
 The field was covered by a deep wood on all sides
 It was an excellent trap, and our men were quick to take advantage of it
 •This was nn error, it wat Captain Greun, uid-de-uump to General Phil- lips, who was wounded

 Pray, my dear General, read the inclosed, and let the amiable object know, the first opportunity, what was accomplished by our troops
 GeneraHJates despises a certain pompous little fellow 1 as much as you can, and tells me, confidentially, that nothing could give him so much satisfaction as your presence here, though I find his sup- porters are, unfortunately, your enemies; hence his silence
 As Mr
 Burgoyue has no alternative, having destroyed the bridges in his rear, and as the armies are within two miles of each other, he must shortly commence action
 We have at this time about six thous- and combatants, and the enemy can bring to action about an equal number
 I think without some military trick the day will be our own, as that enthusiasm which reigned at Ticonderoga pervades all the eastern troops, and the late severe engagement, instead of damp- ing their spirits, has made them impatient for action
 Wo are just this moment informed of the success of a descent on Lake George by a detachment from a body of militia under Gen- eral Lincoln, which was in the rear of Mr
 Burgoyne
 It was com- manded by the famous Colonel Brown
 He very dashingly carried the post at the landing and at the saw-mills, took two captains, nine subordinates, and two hundred and ninety-three privates, of the 53d British regiment, and released a hundred and nine prisoners
 He had in possession the French lines, and had sent a flag to de- mand the surrender of the fort, but had no artillery to enforce his demand
 He has taken two hundred bateaux, twenty odd gun- boats, some armed vessels, etc
 A letter you wrote me by a Mr
 Hale has by accident been destroyed
 I am now more persuaded than ever that the evacuation of Ticonderoga has been the salva- tion of this Province, perhaps country
 I assure you that great credit is given you, and the British and Burgoyne were greatly dis- appointed by the move
 God bless you
 COLONEL WILKINSON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 CAMP BEMIS'S HEIGHTS, October 7th, 1777

 Permit me to congratulate you on the loss of Philadelphia, as an evei»t fraught with the greatest good consequences, since many vil- lains, who otherwise would have enjoyed the fruits of our virtnous efforts, will by this test be reduced to the necessity of explaining their despicable principles, which will (as I wish a total expulsion of such dastardly unfeeling parricides), I trust, be an unsurmount- able bar to their future existence in this country
 Whilst General Howe reigns trinmphant in an empty city, Gen- eral Burgoyne, without resources, and with barely twelve days pro- visions (at this time) is stopped short in his career, and finds himself unable to proceed, and incapable of retreating without disgrace and ruin
 Since the action of the 19th ultimo, he has remained strongly posted, and has labored incessantly on the fortification of his camp, but the exigency of his circumstances must shortly produce some- thing decisive
 The injured Northern Army will then generously fly to the support of the sinking armies
 An unprecedented amount of desertion prevades General Bur- goyne's army; notwithstanding bribes, threats, and every military precaution is adopted, they come over daily
 We, yesterday, re- ceived fourteen, who all agree in the same tale respecting provisions and the defection of the troops
 Their flour is entirely Canadian, and miserably manufactured, of which they now receive half a pound per day

 Dear General:—Give me leave to congratulate you on the im- portant conquest over General Burgoyne and his army
 The capit- ulation and other particulars you will have, by the time this roaches you, by an abler hand
 A more complete victory you could not wish for, and I believe, by this time, the people in general have altered their sentiments with respect to the evacuation of Ticon- deroga
 The officers, and all who I now hear speak about it, say

 Excuse haste
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL GATES
 CAMP AT WHITE MARSH, November 21st, 1777
 Dear General:—Though my congratulations on your signal suc- cess come rather late, they are not the less sincere
 Sickness in my family had called me away from the army, and I was absent when the news of GeueraltBurgoyne's surrender arrived, an event glorious to you, and that must be attended with the most happy consequences to America, and it affords me the greatest pleasure, as you were the happy instrument in bringing it to pass
 This, my dear General, is not the language of compliment, but of the heart
 I am not used to make professions, but I ever shall be interested in your good or bad fortune, as I have not forgotten, nor ever shall forget, the friend- ship I have received at your hands
 The battle of Gcrmautown happened in my absence
 I can give you little account of it
 There was strange mismanagement, and it has produced infinite courts-martial, and as we have been inactive ever since, seems to have impressed us with a sense of the superiority of the British troops; that gives me much concern
 It is certain our discipline and our numbers, too, are inferior to theirs, but when your victorious troops arrive they will make our scale preponderate; but what can delay them so? Morgan has been arrived above a fortnight
 The fort on Mud Island was evacuated on the 16th instant, at midnight (one of the enemy's ships lying within pistol shot of it at the time), after having sustained a siege of near seven weeks
 It is a very singular event that such a thing, the veriest bicoque that ever was erected should have retarded the operations of an army of twelve or fourteen thousand men and a great fleet so long
 Colonel Smith (a son of your friend, Mr
 Smith, of Baltimore), has acquired im- mortal honor in defense of it
 The cheveaux-de-frize are not yet removed, nor will they be, so long as we maintain the Jersey shore, but that I fear will not long be the case, as the troops from New York are landed at Billingsport, and a large detachment from Phil- adelphia, under the command of Lord Cornwallis, has joined them; Greene, however, with his division, has marched to oppose them, and he has, likewise, Varnum's brigade
 My affair is still in the same situation as when I last wrote you

Page 446

446 The StSt. Clair Papers
 I am firmly persuaded it is the intention of Congress to avoid bring- ing it to trial as long as possible, in hopes that the matter will die away of itself and be forgotten; that, however, is not my intention
 I have been pretty constant in my applications for justice to myself, and to my country, and shall continue them until I prevail or they throw off the mask
 It is melancholy that a body lately so august, so truly venerable, should, in so short a time, be so visibly altered
 If the degeneracy continues (and when intriguing and cabal takes root in public assemblies it generally continues ami increase*), I can not tell what may be the consequences, nor do I like to imagine them; but this is certain, never since this great contest began had we more need of upright, uncorrupted, wise and disinterested counsels and counselors, for we are arrived at the crisis, or very near it
 This train of thought does not arise altogether from what has happened to myself, but from a retrospect of the causes that have brought us to a situation, in which we can with great difficulty get either for- ward or backward
 This moment I have a letter from the President, covering the following very extraordinary resolve: "Whereas, the committee appointed to inquire into the causes of the loss of Ticonderoga and Fort Independence have not yet been able to collect materials and make their report: Resolved, tltat Major-General StSt. Clair be at liberty to attend to his private affairs until he shall have notice to attend headquarters, in order to an inquiry into his conduct
" Judge, now, sir, what I ought to think of them, for I made no such application as this would indicate, or whether the suspicion I threw out above is not but too well founded
 If they had candor or common honesty, they would have owned that, after five months spent in searching for an accusation, they had been unable to find one—one, at least, that they dared to own; and, instead of com- manding me to retire from the army, which is the English of the resolve, with all the ignominy upon my head that they had unjustly endeavored to fix there, could have acknowledged their error, and done what was in their power to remove it; but many of them are incapable of a generous sentiment or action in private life; and a pub- lic station, by making men more acquainted with the views and frail- tics of others, confirms awl increases their own; a trial, however, they shall give me; be the event what it will, they can not rob me of that heartfelt satisfaction which is the companion and reward of virtnous actions

 The cause of virtue was vindicated in spite of them and the adverse faction
 Ten months after the evacuation of Ticonderoga, Washington, having become indignant at the treatment, wrote to the Presi- dent of Congress that the course of that body was looked upon as "cruel and oppressive
" At last, after fifteen months of effort to find some way out of the dilemma in which it wns placed, a committee was appointed to formulate charges based upon the testimony obtained by the committee, at the head of which was John Adams
 Only one witness had been found, and he was a disrepu- table hanger-on of the commissary department, named Jesso Leaven worth
 Not an officer or a soldier to aid the prosecution
 Leavenworth assured the committee that there were over 5,000 troops in garrison, well armed; plenty of provisions, but there was indifference and neglect
 When brought be- fore the court, he swore directly to the contrary on the most important points

 Court met at White Plains, August 23, 1778
 The judge advocate read the charges and specifications which were to substantiate the first, viz: Neglect of duty, cowardice, and treachery, in abandoning the posts
 He called his witness, Jesse Leavenworth, on each charge, and offered, in addition, the correspondence between StSt. Clair and Schuyler and Jay, above given
 The prosecution having been concluded, General StSt. Clair began his de- fense by calling a large number of the officers who had been at the forts, and presented the correspondence in a new and striking light
 Of the tes- timony of the prominent witnesses, we have room only for a few brief ex- tracts
 Major-General Gates being sworn, says: Some time in April, in the year 1777, I made a requisition from Congress for the defense of the Northern Department, and estimated the troops nec- essary for that service as follows: Two major-generals; six brigadiers; one battalion of artillery, 600; twenty-five battalions of infantry, 12,000; two companies of rangers, 10>i; staff, bateaux men, etc
, 400; total, 13,it00
 At that time I did not expect General Burgoyne would have landed between ten and eleven thousand men
 If I had, I should have required more men for the defense of that department

 God to avert those calamities to my country that may ever make my feeble assistance necessary
 General KtSt. Clair's Question
 During; the time I Imd the honor of serving under you, did you ever discover in me cowardice, treachery, or incapacity, as a general officer? A
 From my long acquaintance with you as an officer, and particularly your usefulness to me us a brigadier-general in the campaign of 1770, it ex- cites my astonishment that there should be such charges as cowardice, treachery, or incapacity exhibited against you
 From my knowledge of you, both as an officer and u gentleman, I have the highest opinion of your cour- age, honor, capacity, and fidelity
 Q
 What proportion of these troops ought to be at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence? A
 At Fort Schuyler, 500; the intermediate posts between Albany and Fort Schuyler, inclusive, 600; the posts between Albany and Fort George, inclusive, 600; at Fort Ann and Skenesborough, 300; the remainder at Ti- conderoga and its dependencies
 Hesides these, I expected aid from the mi- litia of the country, having unlimited powers from Congress for that pur- pose

 Supposing Ticonderoga to have been aban- doned, and the enemy to have been in possession of it, would it have been possible to have maintained the works on the point of Mount Independence that were made for tho command of the lake and the defense of the bridge? A
 No, as the ground overlooked them about fifty feet
 General Si

 Do you recollect where the place from which we got our water was, on Mount Independence side, and the situation of it? A
 On the west side of Mount Independence, on the low ground, near the lake
 General StSt. Clair s Question
 Supposing the enemy had passed some of their vessels into South Bay, would it not have been wholly in their power to havo cut us off from the water? A
 The spring would have been exposed to the fire of the enemy
 General St
 Clatr's Question
 Do you recollect the distance from the lake to East Creek, beyond the south end of Mount Independence? A
 About one-half a mile or three-quarters
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Would it net have been in the enemy's power to have annoyed, from tho vessels from South Bay, any troops that might have been marching across the isthmus to tho relief of Mount Independ- ence? A
 It would havo been in the enemy's power to have done it, on account of the passage being narrow, a thick wood, and the possession of tho lake
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Do you recollect whether any works were

 Adieu, my dear general

 Yes; by your order I marked out the lines, and prepared the fascines, •which was after General Schuyler left Ticonderoga
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 In what condition was the fort upon Mount Independence? A
 It was a picketed fort, only for small arms
 Picketed all around; some good and some bad
 General SiSt. Clair's Question
 How many men could the fort contain, with convenience, for the defense of it? A
 About 1,000 men
 General St
 Clan's Question
 What batteries had the enemy erected against Ticonderoga at the time or before the evacuation took place? A
 One battery was erected against the Jersey redoubt, on the opposite side of the lake, about half a mile distant, and on higher ground
 They had made some works where they hud an encampment, against the French lines, about half a mile or three-quarters distant The enemy had also taken possession of Mount Hope, a retrenched camp, which had been occu- pied by us the campaign before, by which the communication with Lako George was cut off
 They hud taken possession of the mill, burnt the block-house, and passed on the other side of the creek, when they took pos- session of a hill which commanded Ticonderoga and all Mount Independ- ence, and had begun a firing on the sloop that was stationed for the defense of the passage from Lake George
 They had also begun some works on a point on the east side of the lake, opposite to the bridge
 General SiSt. Clair's Question
 Do you recollect Colonel May's having told me, after I had spoken to the militia at Castlotown, that the men would stay, but the officers would not? A
 I do not recollect Colonel May's having told you of it, but I met some of the militia on the retreat, and having expressed my surprise at their not staying to fight for their country, they answered, they were willing to stay, but their officers would not
 Brigadier-General Poor sworn and examined at great length as to the de- tails of tho management of affairs at the forts, and after the evacuation
 This only need claim our attention, although all is important
 General St
 Clatr's Question
 Was our force in any degree adequate to the- defense of the places? A
 No; I think the places could not have been maintained unless with at least ten thousand good troops, and we ought to have had possession of two hills without tho French lines, as also the one on the other side of tho lake, known by the name of Mount Defiance
 General Schuyler, being duly sworn: General StSt. Clair's Question
 What troops had you estimated for the de- fense of the garrisons of Ticonderoga and Mount Independence? A
 Ten thousand continental troops
 I do not know that I mentioned in 29

 P
 S
—I am extremely happy at Wilkinson's promotion,1 and my letter to General Washington and to Congress that they should be con- tinental troops, but I intended them to have been continental troops
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Do you think the posts tenable with the force I had? In answer to this question, General Schuyler produced an extract from a •copy of a letter to Congress, dated the 8th of June, 1777, which he says was sent by express to Congress, and was received by them about the 13th of June, but he did not receive any answer to the letter till late in July
 The letter put Congress in possession of the weakness of the posts, the paucity of the garrisons, and the want of clothing and provisions
 These facts are detailed in the letters above given
 General Schuyler says further, in answer to the question, that when he mentioned in the letter to Congress that between two and three thousand men were sufficient to have maintained Mount Independence, he conceived the post, about which orders had been given the beginning of February to Colonel Baldwin, was far advanced; that the obstruction in the lake was completed; that there were carriages provided for the cannon; that lines were completed, and not by one-hull so extensive as he found them
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Did you ever give me any orders for evacu- ating these garrisons? A
 No
 The reason why I did not give you any orders for evacuating these garrisons was because I had wrote this letter to Congress, and they did not give me any orders about it; and as the Continent conceived them of great importance and very strong, I did not think myself at liberty to give any orders for an evacuation of them
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Was the defective state in which you found Ticonderoga and Mount Independence owing to any negligence in me, or disregard to the orders I received from you? A
 It could not be owing to any negligence in you, or disregard to the orders you received from me, as you had arrived there but a few days before j nor was it owing to the negligence of any officer who had commanded there in the winter or spring before; nor to the commanding officer of the artil- lery or the engineer
 I conceive it to be owing to a want of men and a want of materials
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Do you know of any steps taken by the Eastern States to reinforce these posts, after their investure? A
 Immediately on my return from Ticonderoga, I wrote to the Eastern States to hasten on the remainder of the continental troops
 Some troops came up in consequence of my application, but did not reach Albany till some time after the evacuation of Ticonderoga
 Upon receiving the first letter from you after I returned from Ticonderoga, I applied to the Eastern States, and to this, for reinforcements of militia
 The militia from Massa- chusetts arrived at Fort Edward, I believe, between the 4th and 7th of July
 A few from Connecticut did not join us until towards the latter end of July
 Those from this State got up much about the same time that the Massachu- 1 Sec Note 1

 451 thank you very heartily for procuring it
 He has great merit, and setts did
 The Massachusetts militia were up as soon at Fort Edward, and those from this State, as I uould reasonably expect them to be
 Connecticut, as I was informed by Governor Trumbull, had a call for militia from Gen- eral "Washington to go to the Highlands, or Peeks-Kill
 That was the reason that the militia did not join us sooner
 General SiSt. Clair's Question
 Did the force you had collected, supposing the garrison to have held out, put you in a situation to have raised the seige? A
 I believe that, with all the troops you brought with you, with the rein- forcements with General Nixon, and including all the militia, I had not at Fort Edward, about the 20th of July, more than five thousand men
 If the garrison had remained, I should have had no more than three thousand militia, before I was joined by General Nixon, to have marched to its relief, which number I conceive very inadequate to have raised the seige
 General Nixon, I believe, arrived about the 12th or 13th of July; but if I had had a force which I might think was sufficient, yet should not have been able to have raised the seige for want of provision, there being scarcely any pro- vision of the meat kind in the department; flour was plenty
 Nor was there any stock of provisions of the meat kind laid in—not even a sufficiency of salted meat to have furnished the scouts with
 We had not lead in the de- partment sufficient for an army anything like to have raised the seige with
 At Fort Edward, on the 7th of July, we were obliged to strip the men that were there of every cartridge they had to send them to Fort Ann, and were left without any lead for some days, excepting a mere trifle I got from Al- bany, a very small quantity brought up by the militia, and by stripping the windows
 General StSt. Clair's Question
 Did I not, when it was determined in the council of officers that was held the 20th of June, 1777, respecting the hold- ing of Mount Independence and evacuating Ticonderoga, express my opinion that it would be impossible to hold that post, when the other side of the lake should be abandoned? A, I remember perfectly well you did
 EXTRACTS FROM THE SPKECH OF GENERAL ST
 CLAIK
 General StSt. Clair began by expressing his gratification that at last his con- duct was to be inquired into before " a proper judicatory, and that, after so long a delay and so injurious a discrimination, public justice will be done upon a full, an impartial, and dispassionate examination, and that it will be passed upon by men equal to the task of investigating truth, however art- fully concealed, and determining upon the intrinsic merit of military actions, stripped of the glare that is sometimes thrown upon them by success, or the false lights in which they are often placed by adverse consequences
" "The first observation that naturally offers is, that the charges which have been exhibited to this Court have all been founded upon the ex pnrle affi- davit of a Mr
 Leavenworth, which (in most instances) he has contradicted in open court, and consequently is entitled to no degree of credit, and upon my own letters to Congress and to General Schuyler, the officer who com-

 what is, in my opinion, more valuable, he ha* a warm, lumest heart
 I have known many an arrant knave with considerable abilities
 manded in chief in the Northern department
 It is singular, however, that charges of so high a nature against an officer of my rank should be at- tempted to be supported (for supported I trust they are not) by no other living witness than Mr
 Leavenworth, a private man! a follower of the army! in some of the lowest and vilest occupations! who, if ho had had capacity to judge, could not possibly have had proper information; that not an officer of any rank whatsoever has been called upon; and yet, had treachery, hud neglect of duty, been committed—had I been inattentive to the progress of the enemy—had the posts in my charge been shamefully abandoned—or had I been guilty of cowardice—they could not have escaped their notice altogether; nay, it was by them only they could probably bavi; been discovered
 But this, by-the-by
 Previous to any remarks upon, or application of the testimony, I beg leave to inform the Court that, before I left Philadelphia to take upon me the command of Ticonderoga, Congress had received information, which they credited, that the principal part of the enemy's troops in Canada were ordered round by St
 Lawrence to join Gen- eral Howe; that no serious attempt would be made upon Ticonderoga; at most, it would be a diversion only
 This was communicated to me by Mr
 Hancock, then President, and I have his authority to mention it to this Court
 This circumstance will serve as a key to many of my letters, and" will account for my doubts about some intelligence I received after my ar- rival at Ticonderoga
 And it appears, from General Poor's testimony, that General Gates had likewise, from them, received the same account
" Charge—Neglect uf Duty: In not having evacuated the posts upon receipt of information from two men from Canada (supposed to be spies), and thus have saved the artillery and stores; and in not keeping out reconnoitering parties in force
 '•I suspect, sir
 the committee who formed these charges had no idea of the nature of a subordinate command
 They would otherwise have known that I had no power to form or execute any such resolution, and that my justification for evacuating the posts at all must depend upon the necessity of the case
 1 did what my duty required me—I gave thu earliest notice to the commanding officer of the department, and stood ready to execute his commands
 But I am persuaded that, had it been in my power to have taken my final resolution then, and upon the intelligence I had received, I had abandoned the posts, although every thing had been saved which has since been lost, the charges of treachery and cowardice would have been very much louder, and pressed home more strongly, and with more violence, if possible, than in the present case
 I should have heard that no decisive operation should be founded on the vague report of prisoners or deserters, often ignorant, almost always ill-informed; but that to abandon a post on the information of persons I suspected to be, and actually were, the enemy's spies, or from the view of an encampment upwards of forty miles off, and that only seen across a lake six or eight miles broad, could proceed from no other than one of those sources, or from perfect stupidity; and this Court, from whom I expect a very different decision, would have joined in that

 453 COLONEL LONG TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 PORTSMOUTH, NEW ENGLAND, November 25, 1777
 Much Respected and Dear Sir:—My not having the pleasure of opinion, and condemned me to the punishment I had justly merited
 But, besides all this, if the council of war was to guide, it was out of my power to take any such measure; for the resolution of the council is that both Ticonderoga and Mount Independence are to be held us long as they can be, consistent with the safety of the troops and stores
 When the safety of the troops and stores became doubtful, Ticonderoga, not Mount Inde- pendence, was to be evacuated
 "Had not the committee been totally ignorant of the nature of the coun- try in which these parties were to act—had they given any intention to the returns of my army, which were before them, or credit to my letters to General Sehuyler, of which they had the perusal—this article would never have made its appearance
 Had it ever occurred to them that the enemy proceeded by water, and that the only debarkation wo hear of was at Gilli- land's Creek, forty miles and upwards from Ticonderoga, and that they pro- ceeded from thence by water again, we should not have heard this story of reeonnoitering parties, of which I am morally certain they themselves had no determinate idea
 My whole army would not have found one party such as they seem to think ought to have been sent out frequently
 I have proven that small parties were sent out, not only frequently, but constantly; and although they were but small parties, they were as strong as the state of my garrison, and the works in hand, would allow
 It is true, indeed, I obtained by them no certain intelligence of the enemy's force until they landed atThree-Mile Point, nor was it possible before; they possessed neither the gifts of divination, nor walking upon the water; but they could give me information if any part of the enemy's army was advancing by land, «nd that WHS all I could expect from them
" The second charge is cowardice, treachery, and incapacity us a General
 "By Mr
 Leavenworth's testimony again are these accusations to be sup- ported; not in a direct manner, but by inference and deduction from that part of it which the committee in the above remark say he yave them, viz
, •that the enemy were not annoyed in the advance to, and investiture of, the posts;' but which he in part contradicted here, as I observed before, and which, by Colonel Stevens, General Wilkinson, Colonel Livingston, Major Dunn, and others, I have proven to be false
 The inferences of consequence are false likewise, and, of course, the charges groundless
 But I believe it Is the first instance where charges of a capital nature have been brought against an officer by deduction, without a shadow of proof to support them; and cowardice and treachery are capital crimes, although the committee have directed them to be tried by an article of war to which no capital crime whatever can be referred, having been expressly provided for crimes not capital
 I waive, however, any advantage that might be taken of this
 My reputation, or my safety, shall never depend upon the blunders of any set of roen who may think proper to accuse me, but, when proof is wanting, can-

 hearing from you since I saw you at Stillwater, induced me to be- lieve my letter of the 20th September miscarried
 To prevent the dor will never attribute actions to the worst cause from which they could possibly flow; good nature will ever ascribe them to the best
 Hitherto, however, I have experienced very little of either But my birth, sir, my ed- ucation, my connections, both in this country and in Britain, my station iiv life, my children (if to these had not been added the habitude of early life), as they were the best pledges, so they should have secured me from the im- putation of those most shameful vices, from which the meanest of the peo- ple are generally free
 But my reputation rests not on that bottom
 
I am happy in the general good opinion of the army, which is never bestowed upon cowards, nor has all the calumny that I have been loaded with shaken me a single friend
 The court have the fullest evidence that on every occa- sion I have given demonstration of an active, as well as passive, courage; my conduct in that respect has been uniform on all occasions , and this is confirmed by the concurring testimony of many of the principal officers of the army, with some of whom I huve been, personally, in almost every action that has happened during the war
 From thence they must conclude that, whatever might have been the motives for my evacuating Ticonderoga, it could not have been owing to cowardice, and that the charge is false, ma
 licious, and scandalous
 "Treachery, sir, is a crime it is impossible to prove, positively, not to have been committed
 It is, therefore, necessary, in order to fix it, that some ac- tual commission should be proven, but, as this has not been attempted, it is enough, alone, to overthrow the charge
 But I beg leave to in form the court that when Congress appointed me to the command of a regiment, I considered it as the call of my country, that could admit of no refusal
 I reflected that some knowledge acquired by study, and the service of the last war (during which I was in almost every scigo and every action of conse- quence), put me in a situation to bo of some use to our army in its infant- state
 My country, I thought, had a right to my services, and to every ad- vantage that could be derived from my experience
 I, therefore, without hesitation, resigned an honorable and profitable employment I then hold un- der the Crown, to qualify myself for that offered by Congress, notwithstand- ing it was not of one-halt the yearly value
 I quitted the sweets of a re- tirement I was fond of, the pleasures of domestic life, and the care of edu- cation, and provision for a rising family (both of which claimed my closest attention), for the toils, the hardships, and the extraordinary expenses of war Hnd this the appearance of treachery? And yet, for these, I have- met with the ungracious return of those cruel accusations, though, surely, they were not the natural returns for such conduct
 What further promo- tion Congress were pleased to confer upon me was wholly unsolicited
 I received it with gratitude, determined that my actior s should be the best proof of the sense I had of the honor they had dune mn; nor have I been therein disappointed
 My country now reaps the solid advantages of my conduct, whilst I am loaded with obliquy and abuse
 I forgive it, however, but I can never forget that the channels of justice have been shut against

 455 like misfortune, this goes under cover of George Frost, Esq
, a member of Congress from this State
 I sincerely long to see a publication in the papers of your acquit- me, and that for thirteen long, long months, I have been hung up to be stung by the envenomed tongue of malice, and pointed at by the finger of folly
 But the sentence of this court will, I trust, place me once more in that honorable point of view from which I have not deserved to be re- moved, having been careful to observe that maxim of Horace— Nil conscirc nbt, nulldpallascere culpa I1" But the committee again return to the point of evacuating the posts, and declare that it ought to have taken place when the enemy reached Three- Mile Point [General StSt. Clair established the fact that in April Congress had declared that, unless the Eastern States came to the relief of the garri- sons, the posts would be lost
 Then, why did not Congress, the supreme power, order the evacuation ?]
 General StSt. Clair continued 
 "Sir, had a retreat been attempted upon the enemy's landing at Three- Mile Point, and the steps pursued which the committee have enumerated above, it is impossible, in the nature of things, but the army must have been cut off, or fallen prisoners into their hands
 But, by our putting a good face upon the matter, and showing a determination to hold both posts, they were in- duced to divide their force, in order to invest us, and reduce by the more slow but certain method of regular approach; not that this method was nec- essary to them, for they might most certainly have carried us by assault at any time
 But assaults are frequently very bloody things, and on that cir- cumstance I chiefly depended for rendering my small garrison serviceable- to their country
 I was in hopes the enemy would assault us, and some ac- counU that I had, that they were short of provisions, gave me some reason* to expect it
 I depended upon my troops; I was persuaded they were brave, and I believed they, too, had confidence in me
 Every order and every ad- vice I gave them, pointed directly to that object—and I still believe that, bad they attempted it, wo should have given so good an account of them, that the conquest of Ticonderoga would have terminated the operations of that campaign, but conquered it would have been after all our exertions
 Every letter I have written holds up the same idea, and I always speak of an attack as contradistinguished from a seige; and the character of the Gen- eral I was opposed to gave me reason to expect something by assault or surprise
 1 mentioned to Congress, so early as the 25th of June, the great deficiencies in troops and provisions, and the probability of my being obliged, from these circumstances, to evacuate
 The moment I was informed, with any tolerable degree of certainty, of their numbers, which I was not until the 3d of July, from a prisoner and some deserters (their information was confirmed by a spy I sent into their camp the 3d and returned the 6th), and saw that they meant a regular seige, I was certain the defending the posts effectually was impossible
 The moment, however, 1 chose for the retreat, (1) The quotation complete is as follows: Hie murus aeneus esto, Nil conscire sibi, nullA pallescerc culpa

 tal respecting the evacuation of Ticonderoga, which I am very sen- sible must be with the greatest honor, and, when that happy period arrives, I hope to again have the satisfaction of serving under you as it was the only one was in my power to choose, so it was almost the only one after the enemy's landing at Three-Mile Point in which the retreat could have been effected
 "I have fully proven that the sick were not left behind nor lost; that great part of the cannon, all the ammunition, the baggage and tents of the army, the hospital stores, and part of the provisions, were removed from Ti- conderoga—as much as could ut once have been removed ut any prior time
 Every boat was loaded
 I think I have proven it to have been necessary, and well conducted, and that the confusion, occasioned principally by the burning of General Fermoy's house, and his not circulating the orders to his brigade at the proper time, was soon remedied
 I beg the Court to re- flect one moment upon what was to be done, and how short the time to do it in! For, though the evacuation was resolved on about three o'clock in the afternoon, we could not begin to carry it into execution until night came on, the enemy being in possession of a high hill on the opposite side of the lake, from whence they could see our every movement; that it was the season when the nights are at the very shortest, and that it was, moreover, moon- light; and that the necessity of keeping the matter a secret, until the very moment of evacuation, prevented any preparatory steps being taken to ex
 pedite the business, and they will be of the opinion that more was never done, caeterix paribus, in equal time; and if, in the different embarkations, some irregularities did happen, when every circumstance is taken in—the suddenness of the thing; the disposition every man would naturally have to save perhaps his little all; the confusion the night alone is apt to occa- sion; the distance every thing had to be carried, and their variety, the can- did mind will be more apt to wonder that any order could be preserved, than that some irregularities supervened
 I need not tell this honorable Court that a retreat, with an inferior army, from before a superior one, is perhaps the most dangerous and delicate undertaking in the whole circle of military operations, and that it never will be effected without prudence, fortitude, and secrecy
 I hope I have satisfied the Court that I could not order the evacuation until the last moment, when I saw no alternative be- twixt that and the certain loss of the army
 I think I have proven that that moment was arrived, ns one day more would probably have completed the investment of the posts, and then it would have been impossible
 I have proven that my motive was not to avoid the enemy, but to save the army, and, by removing them to a place where reinforcements could reach them, to make them as a basis of a force sufficient to cover the country, and check the progress of the enemy; and this I did with the certainty of a loss of reputation, the price few people are willing to pay even for the pros- perity of their country
 I, indeed, expected it would be a temporary loss only, nor will it be more, though it has already been of much longer dura- tion than I looked for; and I fear the so long delaying to afford mo an op- portunity to vindicate my character, is not very likely to induce others who

 457 in the army, as nothing could give me greater pleasure
 My dear Sir, let me hear from you as soon as possible
 In the meantime, be assured none wishes you more happiness than your most obedient humble servant
 may happen in like circumstances to make a similar sacrifice
 My letter to Congress, of the 14th of July, proves that I foresaw the events that would probably happen, and which must have had some effect upon my determina- tion
 "Indeed, from the knowledge I had of the country through which General Burgoyne had to advance, the difficulties I knew he would be put to to sub- sist his army, and the contempt he would naturally have for nn enemy whoso retreat I concluded he would ascribe to fear, I made no doubt he would soon be so far engaged, as that it would be difficult for him either to ad- vance ot retreat
 The event justified my conjecture, but attended with con- sequences beyond my most sanguine expectations
 A fatal blow given to the power und insolence of Great Britain, a whole army prisoners, and the reputation of the arms of America high in every civilized part of the world! But what would have been the consequences had not the steps been taken, and my army had been cut to pieces or taken prisoners? Dis- grace would have been brought upon our arms and our counsels, fear and dismay would have seized upon the inhabitants, from the false opinion that had been formed of the strength of these posts, wringing grief and moping melancholy would have filled the now cheerful habitations of those whose dearest connections were in that army, and a lawless host of ruffians, set loose from every social tie, would have roamed at liberty through the defenseless country, whilst bands of savages would have carried havoc, devastation, and terror before them! Great part of the State of New York must have submitted to the conqueror, and in it he could have found the means to enable him to prosecute his success
 He would have been able effectually to have co-operated with General Howe, and would probably have soon been in the same country with him; that country where our illustrious General, with an inferior force, made so glorious a stand, but who must have been obliged to retire if both armies came upon him at oncu, or might have been forced, perhaps, to u general and decisive action in unfavorable circumstances, whereby the hopes, the now well-founded hopes of America, of liberty, of ponco and safety, might have been cut off forever
 Every consideration seems to prove the propriety of the retreat, that I could not undertake it sooner, and that, had it been delayed longer, it had been delayed too long
" The Court, having duly considered the charges against Major-General StSt. Clair, and the evidence, are unanimously of opinion that he is Ab/ Guilty of either of the charges against him, and do unanimously acquit him of all and every of them with the highest honor

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO ROBERT MORRIS
 CAMP AT WHITEMARSH, November 13th, 1777
 Sir:—The resolution of the Board of War, respecting the provid- ing necessaries for the army, which was last night communicated by the General * to a council of war, has occasioned my troubling you with this
 They desire the General to take from the inhabitants all the blankets, shoes, and other necessaries they can possibly spare; that he appoint proper officers to make the collection, and that no- great regard be paid to the circumstances of the disaffected
 I can not bring myself to think that any effectual supply for the army can possibly be procured in this manner; indeed, I do not believe an adequate supply of blankets can in any manner be obtained, and the gentlemen who compose that Board seem to have forgotten how much the inhabitants of this State have already been stripped of the article of blankets; so much, however, I am certain it has been the case, that very many families will sensibly feel the effects of it 1Lafayette was about to snil for France, for the purpose of inducing the Court of that country to give more active assistance to the American cause

 459 this winter
 The troops of many of the neighboring States, as well as our own, have been supplied by them, which is the reason that almost two-thirds of the militia who are got into the field come un- provided with that article
 How reasonable soever it may appear that the disaffected part of the inhabitants should be compelled to contribute beyond conveniency, as the Board have pointed out no criterion whereby to determine their disaffection, I can not help thinking it improper it should be left to the judgment of the offi- cers who may be appointed, as, let their acquaintance be as extensive as can reasonably be supposed, they must necessarily be ignorant, both of the principles and circumstances of great numbers; and, if they are to depend upon information, it is not improbable it will often proceed from malice and private pique
 The New England States have never contributed a single blanket towards the general supply of the army; and, I believe, generally their own troops have been furnished with those that were imported
 Their country pro- duces a great quantity of wool, and the inhabitants make many blankets
 They, therefore, must be in a situation to contribute to- the wants of the army more effectually, and with less inconvenience, than this country, that has already been stripped almost naked, and that, from its posts being so strictly guarded, is cut off from any re- cruit from abroad
 If there is reason for dealing severely with the disaffected, I am persuaded they are not in fewer numbers nor in worse circumstances in New England than in Pennsylvania, howso- ever immaculate some people may endeavor to make us believe it
 Be that as it may, I am persuaded the collecting them in the man- ner prescribed for Pennsylvania would not be thought eligible for New England, and I can not help wishing that some other may be devised, if another contribution must be made here, as that may be very unequal and oppressive, and will certainly be highly irritating
 The people are already not a little jealous of the army, and such an exertion of what will appear to them military power, can not but produce mischievous effects
 It is certain, however, that the army can not possibly keep the field in this severe season which is just at hand without a supply of clothing
 The difficulties that seem to attend it for this trifling army would lead to a train of thought which I do riot like to indulge, and would by no means trouble you with
 The utmost that can possibly be expected from this State is to provide for their own troops, and what may be drawn from the in- habitants should not be diverted into other channels

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO JOSEPH REED, PRESIDENT OF PENN- SYLVANIA
 CAMP NEAR VAN NESS'S BRIDGE, February 21st, 1779
 Sir:—The bearer, Major Mentgiz, after much solicitation, has ob- tained leave to go to Philadelphia in order to make his claim to the Committee of Arrangements
 He and Major Murray conceive themselves to be injured by the promotion of Major Nichols, and I do myself the honor to inclose you the representations they have made to me on that head Nothing would satisfy him but his going to Philadelphia to make them in person, to which the General1 at last reluctantly consented
 You will probably be troubled likewise, in a few days, with the claims, I should rather say demands, of the officers of the First Regiment with regard to Captain McKissie
 Upon his arrival, two of the officers waited upon me to acquaint me that all the officers had determined to resign in case Captain Mc- Kissie insisted on availing of the appointment he had received
2 I advised them to a decent representation of their rights to the Board of War, assuring them that if, through any mistake or inadvertence, they had been injured, they might depend upon redress, putting them, at the same time, in mind of the hardships of captivity, and that the rule they seemed to wish established for Captain McKissie might operate hereafter against some one, or all of themselves—in answer to which I received a letter, signed by three Captains, the Captain-Lieutenant and six Lientenants, which is nearly all the officers present with the regiment, in which they formally resign their commissions, declaring they are determined not to serve a moment under what they deem an imposition
 Their pretensions are founded on the resolve of Congress, that directs the promotion to be regimental up to a certain rank
 It gives me great pain to see such a spirit of cabal prevail amongst the troops of our State, for I take both this and the pretensions of Majors Mentgiz and Murray to be greatly owing to that, and, if it is given way to, it is verv hard to say where it may stop; and, yet, if the resignations are accepted, it will be very difficult to find officers to supply their places; and what adds to the misfortune, they are generally officers of approved 1 General Washington
 2Captain McKissie had been n prisoner, and the Board of War having decided that such hardship should not work the loss of position or promotion to officers, when exchanged he availed himself of the rule
 This WHS resisted by the officers in line of promotion, who had not been captured
 This rule was prolific of dissensions, notwithstanding its justice

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 461 bravery and character
 I have, however, for the present, refused the resignations, and assured them that I would present none to his Excellency that should ever come in like manner
 This will prob- ably bring them to send a memorial to your Excellency, or the Board of War, and I have mentioned it that you might be prepared for it beforehand, and perhaps be able to devise some remedy
 On Monday, a person, whom the officers have agreed to recom- mend for the distribution of the stores the State have been pleased to provide for their troops, will set out for Philadelphia, by whom your Excellency will receive the information respecting the mode pursued in the Maryland line you wished for
 I hope, after his ar- rival, if the Council approve of him, the stores will be forwarded without delay, as it would certainly help to allay the discontents that too generally prevail
 One of them, I find, has arisen amongst the soldiery, from a no- tion that they have generally been returned as engaged for the war, and this opinion has prevailed, too, amongst the officers, although their enlistments chiefly run for three years, or during the war
 I am very clear their time of service determines with the three years,1 and that the war is only a limitation of the engagement, on a sup- position it may he over before that period elapses; but you will oblige me by informing me whether I am not mistaken
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 CAMP AT MILLSTONE, March 5M, 1779
 Sir:—I have the honor to inclose you some of the resolutions of the State of Massachusetts Bay, relative to the supply of their troops; and letters from General Scott, of New York, and the commissary of that State, on the same subject
 The resolves of Connecticut have not yet been • procured
 By them you will observe how differently the troops of these States have lx>en treated from those of Pennsylvania, and that in New York they have extended their attention and bounty to the families of their soldiers, who are supplied with the necessaries of life at very mod
 erate rates
 The same, I am told, has taken place in Mas- 1 This difference of opinion as to term of enlistment resulted in the mutiny of the Pennsylvania line, which came near being disastrous to the whole army at a most critical period
 It was finally adjusted by Congress accept- ing the statement made above by General StSt. Clair, which will be more fully explained hereafter

462 The StSt. Clair Papers
 sachusetts Bay
 I wish I was certain that many of ours, in this time of scarcity, were not starving
 The troops of Virginia are also supplied with necessaries at very low prices, and, at this very time, broad-cloths and linens are sold in camp to their officers, at as low a price as they could ever have been purchased for; besides, they are now making up their pay- books for six months' pay, a present from the State as some compen- sation for the depreciation of the money
 This difference alone, would sufficiently account for the dissatisfaction that so generally prevails in the Pennsylvania line; so great that the officers are ready to seize even the shadow of a pretext to quit the service, and, unless some remedy is very soon applied, I believe we shall have very few officers indeed left by the opening of the campaign
 An- other reason, however, is the effect of that resolve of Congress that restrains them to one ration
 It bears very hard upon them; the money they receive from those retained being so far from an equiv- alent that it will scarce purchase any thing—to such a low ebb is our money run down, and the cursed spirit of extortion risen at the same time; in the meantime, I have heard that there are some stores coming on
 This will, I hope, convince them that they are not altogether neglected, and nothing in my power shall be wanting to keep them easy until further provision can be made; but I very much doubt its being in the power of the State to supply them so amply as some of our Southern and Eastern neighbors
 The mode of oppressing the district for a regulated number of shoes and stockings, as mentioned in General Scott's letter, it seems to me might easily be carried into execution in Pennsylvania, and, thereby, I think, a very considerable supply might be procured
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT KEED
 March 6, 1779
 Sir:—Since I wrote you, yesterday, another very disagreeable circumstance has occurred in our line, which I was informed of an hour ago
 The officers, it seems, have formed a committee to state their grievances to the field officers, who were some time ago ap- pointed by General Wayne to correspond with the Committee of Assembly
 They enumerated to them several, the principal of which, however, were: the depreciated state of the money, and the little care that has been taken to supply them, whilst the troops of some other States, serving with them, have been very amply and
Page 463

Cotrespondence, Addresses, Etc
 463 very reasonably supplied
 So far, they had reason; but they have gone farther
 They complain of the half-pay establishment, and want a provision made for the widows of such officers as have fallen or may fall in the contest, and require them to represent these matters to the legislature of the State, and acquaint them that, if they do not receive entire satisfaction on these points, on or before the 15th of April,1 every officer of the line will then resign their commissions into the hands of the executive council
 1MILLSTOWN CAMP, March 8, 1779
 Dear General:—Agreeably to your request, I do myself the honor of transmitting you exact copies of the two arrangements
 The latter is likely to create great uneasiness
 General St
 Glair has recommended a board of field-officers to sit, and endeavor to settle it amongst themselves
 We shall have a difficult task of it
 The officers are greatly irritated
 Yesterday they presented a letter to the committee, signed in behalf of all the officers pres- ent, stating many well-founded grievances, desiring us to paint them in as striking terms as possible, and to inform the House of Assembly, unless im- mediate redress is granted, they would unanimously resign their commis- sions by the 15th of April
 The matter is really serious; such a step will dissolve the division
 We have written to the committee of correspondence yesterday, informing them of Ihr fixed determination of the officers; but I suppose it will be treated, as we have been, with neglect and contempt
 Should you incline to accept the command of the Light Corps,1 I shall 1 General Wayne hnd applied to General Washington for the command of the Light Infantry in the following letter: PHILADELPHIA 10th Feby 1779

 I know not that in my life I have met with any thing that gave me so much uneasiness for the time; indeed, the committees that esteem it a singular happiness to be honored with a command under you
 I received a letter some days since from Colonel Magaw, on Long Island; he desires his compliments
 And believe me, dear General, your most obedient, humble servant, JOSIAII UARMAR
 To General Wayne
 An examination of the communications of General Washington to Con- gress, during the winter of 1770, will show how widespread was the dissatis- faction in the army
 "I have more than once intimated," said he, '• that even a dissolution of the army is not an improbable event, if some effectual measures were not taken to render the situation of the officers more com- fortable
" "The patience of the officers has been a long time nourished by the hope that some adequate provision was in contemplation
 Though nothing satisfactory has hitherto been done, their hopes have been still kept alive; but this can not be much longer the case, and when they come once to fix an opinion that they have nothing to expect, they will no longer combat the necessity that drives them from the service
" "Indeed, not to multiply ar- guments upon a subject so evident, it is a fact not to bo controverted that the officers can not support themselves with their present pay; that neces- sity will oblige them to leave the service unless better provided for; and that remaining in it, those who have no fortunes will want the common ne- cessities of life, and those who have fortunes, must ruin them
" This is fol- lowed by an appeal to provide half-pay for the officers, and pensions for their families in case of their death
 The chief cause for the distress was the depreciated currency, which was daily becoming worse
 This crisis had been hastened by the folly of Congress in insisting on short enlistments in obedience to the demands of New England, where the pride was in the militia
 "Had my advice respecting this matter," said Washington to Joseph Reed, in 1779, " been pursued in the years 1770 and 1776, our money would have been upon a very different establishment in point of credit to what it is at this day, and we should have saved millions of pounds in bounty money, and the consequent evils of expiring armies ami new levies
" The rapidity of the depreciation and increase of distress is shown in a sentence or two: "An attempt has been made," wrote Reed, in 1777, "to eive the old paper money the currency of gold and silver, but it does not succeed
 While beef is sold for 2s
 6d
 per pound in gold and silver, they ask 4s
 and 4s
 6d
 in paper
" In 1779, beef was 10s
 per pound in Baltimore, the cheapest market in the Colonies; butter, four dollars per pound, and hay from £90 to £120 per ton
 The representations of StSt. Clair and the officers under him moved the General Assembly of Pennsylvania to attempt to do something to relieve the distress and discontent
 On the 13th of March [see Journals of Assembly, pp
 335-36], resolutions were adopted, giving to every Pennsylvania officer who received the seven years' half-pay from Congress, a continuation of the same during life, with pensions to their widows, and exempting all lands given to officers and soldiers from taxation
 In the following year, these
Page 465

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 465 have been from time to time formed in the army I ever had a bad opinion of, and dreaded ill consequences from
 They are certainly destructive of that subordination which is the soul of discipline, and will spread the spirit of mutiny and disobedience through the whole
 Unfortunately, our circumstances will not admit of our applying the proper remedy; it is, therefore, necessary to temporize, and I have accordingly shown every mark of disapprobation that did not tend directly to inflame the evil, and by promising to write myself, and desiring the field officers to write; by representing to them the impossibility that the Legislature would yet have had time to take up and consider the grievances they suffered, tfiat had already been stated to them; and the probability that before the time they had specified, they would be convinced of their sincere in- tentions to make their situation as easy as any of their fellow- soldiers, have, I hope, put a stop to a combination ruinous to our public affairs, and disgraceful both to the State and to the parties, but which had it once been gone into, the principles of false honor might have led them religiously to observe
 At the same time, it is my duty to inform you explicitly that their complaints are but too well founded; that I believe necessity has, in a great measure, compelled them to the steps they have taken; and their distresses are aggravated by the comparisons which are constantly before them, which must inevitably sour the minds of men of spirit, who have the consciousness of having literally borne the heat and burden of the day
 It might serve to elucidate their disagreeable situation if I were to give you a detail of the prices which things in general bear
 It would be tedious, however, and I will only say that most articles are as high as in the market of Philadelphia, and some much higher
 Judge of the rest from this circumstance—a dozen of eggs can not be purchased for less than two dollars
 Having mentioned the ill consequences of combination for any provisions were embodied in n statute
 [See 1 Smith's LIIK*, 487
] This prompt action prevented the dissolution of the Pennsylvania line
 The chief credit for this happy event is due to StSt. Clair and his friend, Judge Thomas Smith, who at that time was a member of the General As- scmhly
 In a letter from him to General StSt. Clair, under date of March 27th, I find this paragraph: "I hope my friend will join with me in ex- pressing Ills approbation of our resolves with regard to the army
 Immedi- ately on the receipt of your letter, I made the motion on whieh they are founded
'' "The same comm'ttec that br
night them in, brought in some others yesterday, as well for tile benefit of the recruiting service, as to ex- tend the operations of our first resolves more generally

 purpose whatever, amongst our officers, I can not help taking no- tice, in extenuation, though it serves to confirm the principle of their danger, thut the officers of our State have been led into this by the example of those of New Jersey, who, some time ago, made a simi- lar representation, which produced an immediate resolve of the Council for issuing a very considerable sum of money for their relief
 I am sure I need not press you on this head, but give me leave to repeat that it is necessary something should be done immediately, or there is too much reason to fear the dissolution of our part of the army
 No exertions of mine shall be wanting to prevent so great a calamity; and though it is a misfortune to have come to the com- mand of it at this trying period, if I can steer happily through it, and render any service to my country, I shall not regret any pains it will cost me
 Your favor of the 28th ult
 is this moment come to hand, and the stores were yesterday at Trenton
 They will arrive in a happy time, and I hope by a proper distribution of them to make matters easier
 It must have the effect to convince the officers that the State does not entirely neglect them, and will keep alive expectation, the best handle by which the human mind can be laid hold of; and I shall not fail to make the officers acquainted with the pains you have taken to serve them in this business
 The disputed claims of the officers the General has referred to ourselves, and to-morrow the field officers will meet upon it at my quarters, when I hope we shall be able to hit upon some mode that will please all parties, which, by the by, will not be very easy, in- terest and obstinacy generally appearing under one banner
 If any attempts have been made to engage the gentlemen of the army in the parties that unhappily distract our State, it is altogether unknown to me,1 nor will it ever meet with my countenance; and although I have always been, from principle, opposed to our present Constitution, of which I have never made a secret (and in private life would have joined in any measures that promised to bring about an amendment), yet, whenever it appears to be the choice of the majority of my fellow-citizens, I shall consider it as my duty to ac- 1 While the party fooling seems to huvo been kept from GenertU St

 nevertheless the violence of partyism then raging and distracting the citi- zens of Pennsylvania, on account of the defects of the Constitution of 1776, did reach the soldiers under him
 as the correspondence of his subordinates shows
 But the prevailing sentiment was in accord with that expressed by StSt. Clair

 467 quiesce
 My opposition never arose from a dislike to men, but be- cause I thought it contained principles unfavorable to liberty, and must inevitably sooner or later end in a tyranny of the worst kind
 That pettishness that quarrels with a government on account of those who happen for the time to administer it, is unworthy a man of sentiment and reflection
 I am very sorry that the letters of Colonels Butler, Harmar and Hay should have been so expressed as to admit of a construction I am persuaded they did not intend
 I will have an explanation of that matter as soon as I can see them
 PRESIDENT REED TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, April 26tfi, 1779
 Dear Sir:—Your favor should not have been so long unanswered
 The variety of intrusted business has very much engrossed my at- tention
 When I proposed an alteration in the mode of distribu- tion of the articles sent to camp, I \vas not aware of the difficulty you suggest, but that may be easily got over, if upon consideration you think the system may be altered for the better
 The real scarcity as well as the extravagant prices demanded, will undoubt- edly, at times, occasion some interruption of a regular supply, and I'would wish you to give it some share of attention, and propose whatever may occur to you as an improvement
 The plan you mention of a regular return of the names of the men, and the articles chosen by them, I very much approve, and as it is a very heavy article of expense to the State, it will give me satisfaction if the officers will see that there are no irregularities
 Women and children, wagoners, etc
, and staff officers, will be considered as entitled, and I hope the officers will see that no improper persons arc borne on the returns
 
 
 
 Congress have directed the recruiting service to go on, and with the privileges now given, I think some good recruits may be had, if the bounty could be given, but the demands upon the treasury are now so great as to baffle every means of supply, and we have not been able to draw one shilling for the service
 You say there is a desire prevalent at camp for the taking of some public measures in respect to deserters, and I have had it in con- templation to issue a proclamation, specifying the reward, and en- couraging them to bring them up, but if you can suggest any other stimulus we shall be glad to make use of it

 Pennsylvania has had a pretty smart struggle since I saw you, with the august assembly, which does us the honor of residing amongst us
 I thought at one time we must have come to an open breach, but more temperate means prevailed
 Every step suggested by us was adopted, with some little partialities to General Arnold, which his friends at last worried Congress into
 However, we ap- proved the course of the business on the whole, only wishing that all the charges against him could have been brought before the court-martial; for we have such a confidence in the Whiggism and g
>od sense of the officers, as to believe it desirable that all his pro- ceedings here should be directed to public view
 His friends in Congress got three [four] of the points withdrawn, as not being proper to go before a court-martial, adverting to one of the articles of war, which says: "That conduct unbecoming a gentleman and an officer, is not a proper subject for inquiry before a court-martial
" The time allowed for the trial was far too short to procure the nec- essary attendance of witnesses
 I have, therefore, wrote to the General to fix a time more convenient; the 1st of June would be a much more convenient time
 I should 1x3 glad if you would if not improper, represent this more strongly to the General than a letter c mid
 Considering the connections between Mr
 Dunn and General Arnold, and Mr
 Dunn and L , I should hope L may not be upon the court-martial
1 The Assembly did not transmit us the resolution which you men- tioned
 Congress can not answer the demands of the Commissaries' and Quartermasters' Department, and of the money we are to re
 ceive, we can only get it in small sums
 In consequence of your 1 After the evacuation of Philadelphia by th • British, Genera) Arnold was placed in command of the city
 "Instead of making the exercise of the military authority, with which he was invested for a temporary purpose, as agreeable us possible to the citizens and to the local authorities, Arnold, ac- cording to all concurrent testimony, ndministrred the military trust with insolence
" The result was, the Executive Council of Pennsylvania pre- ferred eight distinct charges against him
 implying neglect of duty or abuse of power, which were laid before Congress
 An investigation was ordered, pending which high words passed between Congress and the State Assembly, Arnold having strong supporters in thn former body
 The result was u compromise, and it was agreed that four of the charges should be sent to General Washington, for hearing before a court-martial
 The military court did not meet until January, 1780, and Arnold was convicted on two irf the charges
 After that, he was placed in command of West Point at his request
 When his treason was discovered, evidence was produced, showing that ho had conducted a treasonable correspondence with Sir Henry Clintons while in Philadelphia

 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, 2,3rf March, 1779
 Dear Sir:—For the more speedy assembling of the militia upon an emergency, I have agreed with the field-officers, in this and the next county, to erect beacons upon the most conspicnous hills, the firing of which is to be the signal for them to repair to their dif- ferent alarm posts
 You will be pleased, therefore, to order a party from your division, consisting of an officer and twenty-four men, with axes and four days' provisions, to be ready to-morrow morning, at eight o'clock, to proceed to a remarkable hill near Princeton, to erect a beacon there
 One Burrel will attend as a guide
 The beacon is to be constructed of logs, in form of a pyramid, sixteen or eighteen feet square at the bottom, and eighteen or twenty feet high, the inner part to be filled with brush
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO COLONEL MEHELM
1 CAMP AT MILLSTONE, March 31x<, 1779
 Sir:—I received yours of this date, and have only to tell you, in 1Commissary of hides
 I have a double purpose in view in giving place to the above letter: First, to show that StSt. Clair had no mercy for those who sought to profit by the misfortunes nf their country
 In the letters of Wash- ington and StSt. Clair, during the darkest days of the war, will be found words of honest indignation for tho-e who took advantage of the people's necessi- ties to amass wealth
 The departments of the army, from which supplies were drawn, were notoriously corrupt
 Secondly, to show to what straits the Americans, whose means for obtaining foreign supplies were precarious, were reduced at this time
 On one of the closing days of the year 1778, the fol- lowing entry was made in the Orderly Book: "The Commander-in-Chief offers a reward often dollars to any person who shall by nine A
 M
 on Mon- day, produce the best substitute for shoes, made of raw hides
 The commis- sary of hides is to furnish the hides, and tin; Major-General of the day is to judge of the essays, and to assign the reward to the best article

 answer thereto, that the orders I have given for hides were by Gen- eral Washington's directions; that the time of contracting for them I know nothing about, nor the delivery, both having happened be- fore I took command in the Pennsylvania line; nor do I see the least necessity either for the shoes being delivered to you or to the clothier-general
 I conceive neither you nor he call be entitled to any commission upon a transaction made with the General's) appro- bation, in which you have no part, and that delivery, and the pro- posed receipts, seem calculated for that end alone
 I have in all the orders I have given desired the amount might be charged to the regiments, by which they would properly appear in your accounts, and the public know where to get payment
 I make no construc- tions upon general orders, and I expect you will now inform me, ex- plicitly, whether you will deliver the hides or not
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, MIDDLEBROOK, 26th May, 1779
 Dear Sir:—My intelligence from New York1renders it indis- pensably necessary for me to look towards the posts in the High, lands
 As your division has been inspected, I wish you to hold it in the most perfect readiness for marching and encamping at an hour's warning
 For these purposes you will settle matters with the Quartermaster-General
 As it is much my wish to have the 1 Genernl Washington formed the opinion, early in tho spring
 tlnit the British contemplated some important movement besides the operations al- ready undertaken against South Carolina mid Georgia, and the coastof Vir- ginia, and he made such dispositions of his small force as he could to meet the emergency
 He had sixteen thousand men —three thousand under Gates in New England, six thousand, a part under McBougnl1, who was com- pleting the fortifications at West Point, and a part under Putnam on the east side of the Hudson, and seven thousand under his own immediate com- mand at Middlebrook
 There were indications of a movement on the Con- necticut const, but it was probable that the chief design of the enemy was to possess himself of the passes in the Highlands, which, as he controlled the navigation of the Hudson, seemed easy of accomplishment; or to take pos- session of West Point and Middlebrook, so as to keep the American forces divided
 With his inferior force, and without the aid of a naval force, "Washington could only act on the defensive
 His operations were limited to securing the important passes on the Hudson, and affording protection to the country
 In Hay, he ordered General StSt. Clair to move his division forward to support McDougall, while be prepared to follow with the rest of his troops

 Sir:—You will be pleased to march immediately with the divis- ion under your command, by way of Quibble Town and Scotch Plains, and take post on the heights between Springfield and Chatham, till further orders, or till some entcrprize of the enemy shall make a sndden movement necessary
 If you should receive authentic advice of the enemv's operating up the North liiver, against our posts in that quarter, you are in- stantly to advance to their support, without waiting orders from me, onlv giving me notice of your movement
 You will pursue the route by Pompton, keeping up a correspondence with General Mc- Dougall, or officer commanding in the Highlands, and regulating your march according to circumstances and the information you re- ceive, advising me, from time to time, of your progress and views
 You will preserve the strictest discipline, and endeavor to prevent every kind of injury to the persons and property of the inhabitants
 You will also take uncommon care to lay open no inclosures of grass or grain, more than are absolutely necessary for the purposes of forage
 I recommend it to your particular attention, without delay, to have officers of talents, attention, and industry nominated to officiate as sub and brigade inspectors, and to improve everv inter- val of leisure to have the new regulations for the order and dis- cipline of the troops carried into execution as speedily as possible
 You are sensible of the importance and necessity of a system

 Sir:—Previous to the receipt of your Excellencv's letter of this day (which arrived about four hours ago), whilst I was examining the grounds pointed out for the division to take post in, I met with Colonel Ogden, who informed me he had seen a person from New York last night, that might be depended on, who informed him that the whole of the enemy's army were marched toward White Plain
---; that a quantity of fascines were embarked on board some vessels in the East River, and many more prepared and laying at the Narrows, on both sides of the river, which were expected to be embarked this day; of which, if I had had the means in my power, I should have given YOU information sooner
 This seems to airrec with the intelligence vour Excellency has received, and particularly marks a design upon the posts in the Highlands
 But they mav have other objects, to prevent the junction of our army on either side the North River; or, failing in that, having drawn our atten- tion to prevent their effecting it, to make a sndden 
movement to- ward New London, which, when considered in itself, although a place of little consequence in the general scale, is of much impor- tance both to them and to us
 Be these as they may, I shall move very early to-morrow to the northward
 Two routes, however, lie before me, that under the Newark Mountains, and that above it, and both will come within my instructions, viz
, to reach Pompton

 Taking the lower road, I am satisfied, would give most satisfaction to the country, but as you have been pleased not to give me an express route to that place, I have determined upon the up- per one, for these reasons: we can arrive sooner at the place where we can be of service if the enemy's designs are against the posts in the Highlands, and we avoid s:>me difficulties that might arise from the enemy's lauding a party and possessing themselves of the coun- try about Pa ram us, knowing, as I presume they will, that part of the army only are in motion; the Pissarche River in front, and the mountains on our flank, are, I am informed, at particular places only, practicable
 At all events I shall not be able to move abjve ten or twelve miles to-morrow, on account of provisions
 The commissaries, depending upon some supplies here, in which they having been dis
 appointed, are obliged to send some of their wagons back to the magazine
 I inclose a certificate of one of them, by which your Excellency will be able to judge how fast we may be expected to move, for I am not informed of any magazines on my route
 But if it is in the country, within reach, unless you forbid it, it shall be taken, and not wantonly
 I beg leave to repeat the necessity of a few horses; many would only incumber us
 The artillery, for the present, is fully sufficient, and even those, should circumstances require us to act amongst the hills, I should wish to be clear of

 MIDDLEBROOK, June 1st, 1779
 Dear Sir:—I duly received your two letters1 of yesterday
 I ap- prove your reasons for taking the upper route
 By the present institution of the inspectorship, neither Major Ryan nor Mr
 McC'ormick can, in my opinion, be appointed inspec- tors
 It is to be feared, however, we may be reduced to the neces- sity of altering it, from the reluctance with which the majors under- take the office
 But I could wish it might proceed as it stands
 If an alteration should take place, that will permit Major Ryan to act in this line hereafter; the opinion I have of his qualifications will make it entirely agreeable to me
 It is hardly probable any change so extensive should take place as will admit Mr
 McCormick, 1 Only one of those is to bo found among the St
 CHiir papers

 but, if I recollect right, there is a resolve of Congress providing that brigade majors shall act as aid-de-camps to the brigadiers, with the same rank and pay
 I do not find this resolve among my pa- pers, but am making inquiry for it
 I wish Colonel Harmur1 may be induced to accept the sub-inspec- torship
 I think he will answer the purpose well
 It is unlucky there is not found greater alacrity among the officers to enter into the inspection
 It is certainly a line which affords a handsome op- portunity for the display of talents, and the acquisition of military knowledge and practice
 You observe that the enemy, among other objects, may have it in view to prevent a junction of our force
 This is an important idea, and ought to have due influence in our movements
 I have ordered a non-commissioned officer and eight dragoons, of the Massachusetts corps, to join you immediately
 I send you a little sketch that will serve to give you an idea of the country you are in

 Sir:—I have received your letter' of this date at half-past eight
 The Virginia division marched this day with orders to endeavor to reach Morristown to-morrow, and to communicate with you and proceed according to intelligence and circumstances
 You will be pleased to open a correspondence with the commanding officer for this purpose
 Washington to StSt. Clair, 30th May
 The latter had suggested that applications might be presented for Ryan and McCormick
 Washingtcm still found embarrassments in the quarter master and commissary departments
 Although Greene, who was at the head of the former, and Wadsworth of the latter, yet subordinates appointed by Congress were many of them in- capable or dishonest
 The Commander-in
Chief attempted to influence Colonel Harmar, and other officers of well-known integrity, to accept sub- ordinate places, but in vain
 The reluctance to make such a sacrifice ex- pressed in a question asked of Washington by Greene, controlled all of the officers who preferred active duty

—7 o'clock A
 M
 Sir:—Colonel Burr arrived here about three o'clock from General McDougall, and brings intelligence of the surrender of the fort upon Verplauck's Point yesterday, about eleven o'clock, by capitu- lation
 The garrison are prisoners of war, aud the officers have liberty to wear their side-arms
 I have no letter from General McDougall; but he is clearly of opinion the enemy mean to attack the posts (at least Fort Arnold,1 the carrying of which would open to them the navigation of the river) in the Highlands
 Colonel Burr informs me that, by landing near where Fort Montgomery stood, aud marching to the Forest of Dean, they would fall into a clove, which runs entirely round that ridge on which the forts are situated, and through which a road might be made almost as fast as an army could march
 By this clove, General McDougall thinks, the forts will be invested
 Be- twixt this clove and Smith's is a chain of hideous mountains, but through them are, no doubt, many passes, with which they mav be made acquainted by the inhabitants, whom they have debauched, and would thereby he able to give much annoyance to any convoys that might pass by Smith's, supposing it necessary to make use of that road
 It seems to be General McDougall's wish that I should move to New Windsor, aud he thinks that the occupying Butter Hill might prevent the attack upon Fort Arnold from the upper side
 At the same time, the state of the provision is very alarming; not much above three weeks in the respective forts, and the militia called in, and their principal dependence for further supplies is upon their being transported across the country from Sussex or Delaware
 I think I could easily reach New Windsor, or at least be so far advanced through the clove as to be out of all danger of being in- 1Fort Arnold was at West Point

1 But it is necessary first to have intelligence from the river, lest the parts of y
mr army on this side of it should be too much separated, and exposed to be beaten by piecemeal
 This I will en- deavor to procure, and act according to circumstances, of which I shall take care to give your Excellency notice
 Notwithstanding the general opinion, that the forts are the enemy's object, Colonel Burr mentions circumstances that leave it still doubtful
 Their troops arc landed at various places on the cast side of the river, and at Haverstraw on the west; and, after the surrender of the fort, their largest armed vessel, supposed to be of eighteen 
guns, and a galk-y, which had passed before, were seen towing down again
 As the passage through the clove is somewhat dangerous for single persons, I shall send two horsemen back with Colonel Burr, and shall, through him, communicate to General McDougall verbally
 It may, perhaps, be necessary to form a march through the clove, in which case I shall leave my baggage at this place, to be forwarded afterwards, as your Excellency may think proper
 Our provision wagons will not be able to supply us when at a greater distance, four only being allowed to each brigade, and three of these broke down upon the road

 As the enemy, notwithstanding their demon- strations of an attack upon the Highland posts, may have it in cou- templation to strike this army (comprehending your division) in its weak and divided state, it will be expedient for you to act with the greatest caution, and perhaps not to advance bevond Pompton till the other divisions get up

 NEW WINDSOR, Jubj 17, 1779
 Dear General:—It was with true pleasure that 1 received the news of your success at Stony Point, on which I beg leave to pre- sent you my cordial congratulations
 It is an event that makes a very great alteration in the situation of affairs, and must have im- portant consequences, and the more glorious from its being effected with so little loss
 It is, in short, the completest surprise I have ever heard of
 Please to present my compliments to the gentlemen of your family, and all our friends
1 acknowledging the receipt of a letter en route, and repenting the contents of Genera) Washington's letter uf the morning, lest it might have miscarried
 Before leaving Middlubrook, General Washington wrote to the President of Congress, informing him thut the movements of the enemy indicated an important enterprise, and that he was hastening to the Highlands on the Hudson us rapidly as possible
 '-Congress will observe, by General StSt. Clair's letter, that he expected to reach Pompton last night
 The Virginia division, commanded by Lord Stirling, marched yesterday for the fame place
 Baron de Kalb, with the Maryland troops, follows this morning
 We f half press forward with all diligence, and do every thing in our power to disappoint the enemy
" On the Cth of June, Washington informed Congress that the British had, on the 1st, opened a battery at Stony Point, which lies on the west side of the Hudson, at the landing at King's Ferry, against a small detached work at Verplanck's Point, on the east side, and kept up a cannonade all day
 The garrison (the work was called Fort LaFayellc i, finding themselves invested also on the land side, surrendered at four o'clock
 The next day the force on the east side, computed at live thousand, advanced to Bald Hill, below the Continental Village, where it was expected an attack would be made on the American forces and an attempt made to gain Nelson's Point, opposite to Fort Arnold
 This, however, was not attempted, and the enemy returned to their former position — live thousand remaining on VerplancL's Point, and one thousand at Stony Point—very busy fortifying
 The Americans took post at Smith's Cove, where General Washington thought they were well posted for rendering assistance to West Point and other posts, if the future operations of the onemy should be directed against them
 1 General Washington clmfed under the enforced inaction of his nrmy
 and hoped for some opportunity to break the silence and show to the country that the enemy could not have it all his own way
 The opportunity came with the departure of considerable detachments from Sir Henry Clinton's army for the purpose of making raids on Connecticut and Virginia
 The expedition to New London, which had been predicted by General StSt. Clair in one of his letters to Washington, was the purpose of one of these

l NEW WINDSOR, 20th July, 1779
 Dear Sir:—You will be pleased to examine critically the long bill in front of Fort Putuam, at the extremities of which the engi- neer is commencing some works
 Colonel Gouvion or Mr
 Koehe- fontaine will be able more particularly to designate the hill I mean
 The possession of this hill appears to me essential to the preserva- tion of the whole post, and our main effort ought to be directed to keeping the enemy off of it
 You will make it the alarm post for your division in the first instance, from which, if requisite, you can reinforce the troops in front
 You will consider this bill in all its relations, and make yourself completely master of its defense
 It will be useful that this knowledge should extend to your principal officers; and that your officers in general should be acquainted with the ground on which they are to act
 I shall be glad also you would they were fairly under way, General Washington projected an attack on Stony Point, in which matter he took counsel of General StSt. Clair
 At his request, the latter made a survey of the enemy's works, and reported on the expediency of the attempt
 On the 9th of July, General Washington asked General Wayne, who had on the first been ordered to advance with his light infantry towards Fort Montgomery, to inspect the enemy's works at Stony Point and Verplanck's, and see how best they could be approached
 On the 10th, he was instructed to make preparations for an attack, but at Wayne's suggestion the attempt was postponed
 On the 15th, at night, under peremptory instructions from General Washington, Wayne made the successful and brilliant assault on Stony Point which marked him as one of the best fighters of the army
 For the best account of this action, see Daw- son's "The Assault on Stony Point
" The above letter requires to be supplemented by the following from GENERAL SCHUYLER TO GENERAL WAYNE
 SARATOGA, July 31,1779
 Dear Sir:—Yesterday, I was honored with a line from our amiable Gen- eral, advising me of the reduction of Stony Point, and dwelling on the propriety with which it was executed
 It was not the least part of my satis- faction to learn that you conducted it; and I most sincerely congratulate you on the increase of honor which you have acquired
 Such of the enemy as have hitherto held erroneous ideas of the bravery and military prowess of our troopp, must now be perfectly convinced of their mistake
 Pray make, not my compliments only, bat my Inve, to Goirral SiSt. Clair, and especially to that great and good man, General Washington, to whom we are all so much indebted

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 WEST POINT, July 15th, 1779
 Sir:—Your favor of the 15th', by Mr
 Broadhead, came to hand two days ago
 All the attention shall be paid to his casel that is possible, und if he can be admitted into the line, it will be very agreeable to me
 His having been left out was not owing to his being a prisoner, but to an idea that prevailed that he had de- clined all thoughts of the army, and meant to follow a mercan- tile life, in which it was confidently asserted he was engaged in that way (the most obnoxious to the officers), known by the name of speculation
 Justice and favor, I hope, will ever govern the de- terminations of the officers when called upon to decide upon the rights of each other, and I can assure you there does not appear the smallest disposition to add injury to the misfortunes of those who have been prisoners; at the same time, it is a pretty general senti- ment that the bringing in the officers of Pennsylvania taken at Fort Washington, into the regiments they then belonged to, is a piece of very great injustice to the officers now of these regiments
 The places of these gentlemen having been filled up by the Council of Safety, and the regiments now raised having nothing of the old ones remaining but the numbers, and, in some cases, a few of the principal officers, for whom vacancies were kept open
 1The case of Lieutenant Broadhead seems to have excited deep interest
 Cienerul Washington also, under date of July Hath, asked StSt. Clair to prompt, if possible, favorable action
 Upon Washington's recommendation, the matter WHS referred to a board of field officers
 It would seem, from a let- ter of StSt. Clair's to President Reed, from West Point, August 2, 1779, the bnard reported against the application, as it was found that he was precluded by n resolution of Congress
 Broadhead had himself, unfortunately, men- tioned the resolution, of which the board were ignorant; and it was the harder on him, as several others in the same circumstances had heen intro- duced previous to that resolution
 The following paragraph concludes the letter of StSt. Clair of that date: "No movement in the enemy's army, of consequence, has yet taken place
 They are retired to York Island, from whence I think an embarkation will soon take place and, from some accounts I have received, it appears to bo destined for the eastward
 However, if Sir Harry is superseded, a new plan of operation may probably be adopted
 This post will soon be in a state that will not so much require the protection of an army

 Uair Papers
 It gives me great satisfaction to see that you have taken up a subject to which you cau d , sa much justice
1 I do, for myself and the rest of the officers, offer you my very sincere and hearty thanks for your elegant address, in the character of a citizen of Philadelphia, which can not fail to make impressions favorable to the plan you are about to propose, as it has added to the grateful sense the officers have 'of your attention to their interests
 It is a matter I have long wished to see some person of capacity and influence undertake, as the situation of the officers, especially those who have families, which is the case with a number, from the ex- orbitant prices of the necessaries of life, and the depreciated state of our currency, is really deplorable
 For my own part, it will be impossible for me to continue in the service without reducing mine to beggary, as I have already spent all the money I had been able to get beforehand, and lost upwards of twenty thousand pounds, by the money in which I was paid for my farm
 The demands upon us for wagoners weakens the line consider- ably
 Could not some means be devised to get wagoners from amongst the militia? Their pay is considerable, and the service easy
 I think it is not less than twenty pounds per mouth
 Many of our regiments are very weak, and, in the course of this campaign, will dwindle to nothing, and the means of recruiting them grows every day more difficult
 The people of Virginia, I am told, raised their last recruits, to the amount of two thousand, by taxing the several battalions of militia with a certain number of men to be ready at a certain day, and, in case of failure, they were to be drafted, leaving it to the battalions to make what terms thev pleased with the individuals who were willing to en^asre
 * A O o It succeeded with them, the fear of being drafted (thereby raising the bounty) acting on the lower class, and the same fear prompt- ing those in easy circumstances to make the bounty very consid- erable
 Would not some such scheme succeed with us? The sev- enty-five dollars allowed by Congress to the recruiting officers might be applied as part of the bounty
 •Tins refers to a plan which President Hood hud formed for securing leg- islative provision for the officers mid their families, cither in hinds or in money
 I!e not only created public

 481 I am verv happy to inform vou that the uneasiness that pre- vailed amongst the soldierv, with respect to the time thev stood engaged for, is at an end
 The present made by Congress, of two hundred dollars, to those who were engaged prior to Januarv last, came most opportunely, and was made so good use of, that the whole, very nearlv, have accepted it, signing, at the same time, an acknowledgment that they were enlisted during the war, so that I have the strongest hope we shall be no more troubled with mu- tinies, conventions, and desertion, which had risen to a very alarm, ing height, and threatened very serious consequences
 This will be delivered by Captain Ziegler, who goes for a further supply
 A small guard is necessary for an escort, but, as we know not how soon all the men we have may be wanted, he goes without one, trusting that a few of the invalids might be sent up with him, who would answer the purpose perfectly well, and save so many men from the line
 Rome of them might also serve as State men and assistants to the commissaries, which we are obliged to furnish, and which takes from us some of our best sergeants
 The reduction of Stony Point you have received an account of
 It was a very gallant action, and reflects great honor upon General Wayne and all the officers, both for the vigor and intrepidity with which it was executed, and the humanity and generosity with which the prisoners were treated
 There is not an instance of a place carried by assault where so few of the defendants have been put to death
 My friend, Colonel Butler, commanded one of the at- tacks, and distinguished himself
 The enemy have again taken post there, but not, I think, with an intention to hold it, but the better to cover the evacuation of the post on the opposite shore, which thev will probably soon abandon
 But, be that as it may, they are certainlv on the eve of some important movement, their whole army, the garrisons of these posts excepted, being drawn down to King's Bridge, and dispositions made, it is said, for evacuating Xew York
 Will you please, sir, to present mv most respectful compliments to Mrs
 Reed and the ladies of your family
1 1 President TCeed replied to the above loiter nt length, August 8th, approv- ing, very warmly, all the suggestions contained in it
 Ho hoped tho plan for providing for the officers who hud been prisoners would be successful "I know it is not popular to urtjo their claims," said he, "but I trust I am not actuated by any other motives than those of justice and duty

 GENERAL GREENE TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 WEST POINT, August 4th, 1779
 Sir:—I have been writing, and am now writing to all the general officers, on a subject which respects myself
 When I was appointed Quartermaster-General, I made a special reserve of my rank, and, consequently, of my command
 In the late arrangement, I have no particular command designated me
 This I conceive to be an injury, and, therefore, have appealed to the officers to learn their sentiments upon two points
 First, whether my right to command, in consequence of my rank, in not unques- tionable
 Secondly, whether any officer, upon just military prin- ciples, will have reason to complain of an injury from my exercising command, in time of action, agreeable to my rank
 To these two points I wish you to give your sentiments
 There can be numberless instances adduced in answer to my claim from the custom and usages of other armies; but the particular reserve I made, I should suppose puts the matter out of all doubt
 If an officer is to lose his command, and be totally excluded from the honors of the line, in consequence of being appointed (Quarter- master-General, it will be a bar against any officer of rank accepting the appointment
 That an officer of rank is necessary at the head of this business, everybody must be sensible
 I have collected the opinions of several of the officers
 They are clear and decided in my favor, upon the right and propriety of my claim
 Your opinion will much oblige your friend
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL GREENE
 WEST POINT, Anymt 10M, 1779
 Sir:—I now sit down to answer your favor of the 4th instant, which was brought to my quarters when I was absent, and l have not before had leisure to consider the subject of it
 You desire my opinion upon two points
 First, whether your right to command, in consequence of your rank, is not unquestion- able
 Secondly, whether any officer (upon just military princi- ples) will have reason to complain of your exercising command agreeably to your rank in time of action
 hear thnt ym have composed the minds of tbo old soldiers; ono of them is worth three new ones
"
Page 483

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 483 As to the first, it is certain that a right to command is a conse- quence of rank, where there is not an exception, express or implied; both of which may happen
 Sometimes, rank is merely honorary, and the exception to command taken expressly in the appointment, as I believe was the case with General Wilkinson's
 It is implied where the acceptance of a staff office destroys both rank and com- mand, but the rank is reserved in the appointment
 This I take to be the case with you, as it was also with your predecessor, General Mifflin
 The intention of Congress in these reservations seem to have been that the serving in the office of Quartermaster-General should not throw the gentlemen who might fill that station out of the line of the army, when they ceased to fill it, but it is very clear to me they did not intend they should exercise command in the line whilst they continued staff officers, and this, I think, must have been some time ago your own view of the matter, as I recollect to have heard you complain of being put upon duty in camp, out of the way of your office
 There can be but little satisfaction drawn from the custom of other armies, the constitution of most being verv different from ours
 We have had, however, an instance before us, in the British army, of the Quartermaster-General acting in the staff and com- manding in the line at the same time, which seems to make in favor of your pretensions
 But I well remember another, in the same army, directly against them
 It was this: Sometime in the cam- paign of 1758, the late General Stephens (then, I think, a major of Provincials), commanded at Fort Ligonier, upon the Loyalhan- ning, when Sir John StSt. Clair, Quartermaster-General, with the rank of colonel, arrived at that Port
 He immediately assumed the command, and ordered Major Stephens to make returns of his garrison and stores to him
 The major insisted on his command, and refused to make the returns
 Sir John put him in arrest
 The major complained to General Forbes, and demanded a court- martial
 Whether a court-martial sat upon the matter I do not recollect, but this is certain, the major was released, restored to his command, and Sir John censured
 I can not conceive that an officer whose rank is reserved can be considered as totally exclnded from the honors of the line, by a temporary suspension of his command, in consequence of his filling a station, for the most part incompatible with it; on the contrary, it seems to me, the honors of the line are expresslv secured to him by the reservation; neither can it be a bar against an officer of rank,
Page 484

484 The SiSt. Clair Papers
 accepting the office of Quartermaster-General
 I think with you, an officer of rank ought to be at the head of that department, but I know not that of necessity, he must be a general officer
 It is a case that does not reach me; I am, therefore, unbiased
 But I should think it an exceeding great injury to see an officer brought from the staff the dav of an action, to take the command of the troops I had had the care and trouble of during the preceding part of the cam- paign, and snatch the palm that was due, perhaps, to the pains that had been bestowed upon them in that time
 I should most certainly give up all command that very moment
 I am sorry to differ in sentiment with other officers, but, when my opinion is asked as a friend, it is a duty to give it candidly, without considering what may be most acceptable, or what others think of the matter
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 WEST POINT, August 24th, 1779
 Sir:—I have now the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the 8th and 19th insts
, which came duly to hand, and to congratulate you again upon another piece of success that has at- tended our arms under Major Lee
 The affair, considered abstract- edly, is of very little moment; but it shows that a spirit of enter- prise exists amongst us, makes the enemy in some measure ridiculous, and serves to support the soldiers under the incessant fatigue they are employed in at this post
1 Inclosed, you will find the recruiting accounts, stated by a board of field officers, with as much exactness as they were able, but they are far from being complete
 The officers were absent or detached with the infantry, tlie amount of whose accounts arc not carried out
 I think the furnishing officers who may be employed in the recruit- ing service with powers to draw money from the county lieutenants, a bad method
 It would render the settlements of the accounts much easier if money on that account was issued to the colonel, or officer commanding the regiments only, the recruiting officers to settle with him, he for the whole with the State
 If they were either negligent or unsuccessful, he would naturallv discharge them and send others, and nothing would be allowed in their ac- 1 Major Henry Lee, Jr

 485 counts but what he was sure would be allowed to him in the general account
 The officers can not have too high a sense of your exertions in their favor, and it gives me a very sincere pleasure that you find the gentlemen in public business so readily concur with you, and thut the spirit of animosity is not so great as it once appeared to be
 Time must wear off the sharp edges, and I fondly flatter myself to see all parties so mellowed down as with cordial unanimity to pursue the public interest, which has, without doubt, in some instances, been left out of sight
 Parties may, indued I believe not, exist in every free State, but when the public good is the principal aim of both, they will not produce private enmity
 In conversation, yesterday, with Colonel Moylan, his regiment came upon the carpet
 A resolve of Congress seems to have had in view that the regiments of horse that have been raised in particular States should be considered as part of their quota in the Continental army
 He would be very happy to find himself in that situation, and though the officers have-not all been taken from Pennsylvania, the men were, I believe, all raised there
 I will be obliged to you if you will please to commumcate your sentiments on that head
 I have very frequent applications for orders to the commissary, in different parts of Pennsylvania, to issue provisions to the wives and families of soldiers, who have left them behind, and are, as they say, starving
 It is really a very hard case, but I do not consider myself as authorized to give any such orders
 Something, how- ever, should be done for them, and I am told that all the women of Colonel Proctor's regiment draw provisions in Philadelphia
 
 
 I received, last week, two letters from Colonel Nichols, inclosing the attestations of six recruits, but two of them only are come on, the others having deserted on their way to camp
 This is really paying very dear for soldiers, and some other way should be fallen upon than sending them ou with small parties of two or three men, who can not pay the attention that is necessary to prevent deser- tions
 Perhaps it would be well enough to allow them to do duty in the Invalids until a sufficient number is collected, and then an officer with a proper party might be sent from camp to bring them on
 Mr
 Gibbons arrived a day or two ago, and is now on trial be- fore a general court-martial
1 1 President Reed rephed to the above letter on the 5th September
 He ap- proved of StSt. Clair'a suggestion as to the proper nuinner of supplying money to regiments; did not think he could do anything for Colonel Moylan;the issuing of supplies to the wives of soldiers would be attended with many

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
1 WEST POINT, October 4, 1779
 Sir:—I have been revolving in my mind the matters your Ex- cellency had under consideration last night, and beg leave to submit my sentiments upon them ; -but they are only broken hints, as I have a very imperfect knowledge of the locality, not having been upon the grounds for many years, and then not having viewed them in a military light
 From Fort Washington to the high grounds at the bottom of the Bay, below Harlem River, is a front to that river of three miles, at no part more than two miles from the North River
 Our troops, drawing down toward King's Bridge, would probably induce the enemy to take this position
 About six miles below Fort Washington, a bay makes in from the North River, from the bottom of which, across the island to the East River, the distance is one mile only
 Supposing the enemy obliged to change their first position, this would probably be their second, a,s it has these advantages, that, be our superiority in num- bers what it may, they can present an equal front, neither flank can be turned, and, in so short a line, great obstacles can be immediately thrown in the way
 But, query: Whether their left flank would not be exposed to the fire of the ships from the North River with the enemy in the first position, as above described
 The difficulties in the way make this less eligible than first supposed
 In the second, it appears very eligible, as the distance across is, I believe, very capable of defense, and they would thereby be cut off from the town, where, doubtless, the stores of all kinds arc deposited; but unless it was made with perfect secrecy, the attempt would proba- bly prove abortive
 Drawing the troops to King's Bridge and Harlem River would certainly induce the first position, as it promises to be effectual, for inconveniences
 "There are such demands for every species of woman's work that no industrious woman can suffer
 In special cases assistance is given them
 I believe Colonel Proctor, who is very ingenious in that way, did get some rations issued to women belonging to that regiment, but when it wus discovered it was stopped
 Itelief may be granted in particular cases, but it would never do to consent to it as a general system
" 1 These hints as to plan of campaign were based upon the supposition that Count D'Estaing would force his way into the North River, and offered at the request of General Washington

 487 preventing the passage of that river, and, from its contiguity to the North River is also convenient for preventing a landing in the rear
 A landing on Long Island, it seems, may be easily effected from Harlem River, either above or below the mouth of it, and the col- lecting of boats there would not discover the real design, as they are equally necessary in either case
 Flushing, the same distance above, is a very convenient place, if not occupied by the enemy
 It is four miles from thence to Jamaica, and eight from that to Bed- ford, where there is a capital pass, which should be instantly pos- sessed, otherwise the army would be obliged to make a considerable circuit by New York to approach Brooklvn
 It is an open country, and good roads from Flushing to Bedford
 The Count D'Estaing can land his troops anywhere upon the southern coast of Long Island—Jamaica Bay, for instance—whence a junction could cosily be made near Bedford
 The distance, I think, is not more than eight miles
 The ships may certainly be destroyed from Long Island, an they must run into the East River, and the post at Brooklyn will soon fall
 With these New York, be its garrison what it will, must fall also
 This appears to me the most eligible method, as there is great probability of success, and much less risk than in forcing a passage over Harlem River, or landing on the island by the North River, in either of which the fate of America must, in a great measure, be set upon a single cast
 When once established upon Long Island, perhaps a sufficient number of troops may be spared to reduce Rhode Island
 If the posts on the North River are not drawn in, I suppose two thousand men might, in a week, with a proper artillery, reduce Stony Point without breaking in much upon the greater operations of the army
 Verplanck must follow immediately
 These hints are all founded on a supposition that we can deceive the enemy, and throw ourselves on Long Island, whilst the gross of their army remains upon York Island; but it is not improbable that they will betake themselves entirely to Long Island, in which case the high grounds, according to the idea I retain of them, from Flat Bush to Bedford to the East River, would be a good position

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 CAMP, October Wth, 1779
 Dear Sir:— 


 I have heard with much pain of the un- happy disasters that have prevailed in town,1 but have not been able to divine the cause
 It surprises me exceedingly that Mr
 Wilson could have been pointed out as an enemy to his country, as his con- duct has, from a very early period, been uniformly friendly, although his opposition to the Constitution of Pennsylvania has been, per- haps, too warm
 His advocating the causes of the accused persons should certainlv not have been considered as a crime, as it is both a part and a consequence of that liberty we have been struggling to establish
 I am pleased, however, that your spirited conduct in quelling the riot meets with general approbation, and that you were happy enough to rescue that gentleman, us it was pretty generally known that you were not upon the most friendly terms
 May I hope that it will have the effect to remove any coolness that subsisted? If I could see you perfect friends, I should be very happy; for I know his worth, and would spare no pains in my power to bring it about
 But I have said enough of this, and per- haps too much
 1This refers to "The Fort Wilson Riot," which disgraced Philadelphia, October 4, 1771), and which is tmceablo to two causes, viz
: (1) The extor- tions growing out of tlu depreciation of the currency; and (2) the violence of party feeiing between the Constitutionals and Anti-Constitutionists
 Most of the Continental soldiers in the Pennsylvania line, with StSt. Clair at their head, were of the latter party in sentiment, but supported the Consti- tution and Government under it during the war
 Loading civilians, their friends, were of the same opinion, which was publicly expressed by Hon- Kdwurd Hiddle: "Our present Government is lamentably defective, and has in it the seeds of the worst of tyrannies, but to attempt by force to over- turn it, would in my judgment be wicked, as well as impolitic
" Congress and the Slates attempted to mend the difficulties—high prices, the oppres- sions and the frauds—incident to a paper currency born of revolution, by laws to govern prices and punish engrossers
 Washington himself had been moved to indulge in very passionate language
 He rejoiced that Pennsyl- vania proposed to bring the murderers of the patriotic cause, the monop- olizers, forestalled, and engrossers, to condign punishment
 "I would to God," said he, "that some one of the more atrocious in each State was hung in gibbets upon a gallows five times as high as the one prepared by Hmnan
 No punishment, in my opinion, is too severe for the man who can build his greatness upon his country's ruin
" But despite such legislation, which really defeated the end sought to b" accomplished by making victims of the conscientious and allowing rascals to escape, paper continued to depreciate

 489 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 CAMP AT TOTOWA, November Id, 1779
 Sir:—In cantoning the troops, there are two objects which seem to claim particular attention—the securing West Point and covcr- and prices to rise
 The popular excitement in Pennsylvania became intense, and a self-constituted committee of citizens of Philadelphia, attempted to regulate the prices of salt, sugar, coffee, flour, and other staple articles, to which regulation Hobcrt Morris and other leading merchants refused to con- form
 In this they were sustained by Hon
 James Wilson, the eminent citizen who, as a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and member of Congress, had been foremost in the cause of the Colonies
 This seemed to incense the party seeking to control the sales of articles of consumption, beyond all bounds, as it was the second time he had stood in their path
 When they had attempted to drive out the wives and children of the Loy- alists, and caused the indictment of persons suspected of sympathizing with the British when they occupied Philadelphia, Mr
 Wilson had, with true courage, stood forth as their defender in the Court; and, although they suc- ceeded in having two Quakers executed, he secured the release of twenty- three other sHxficets
 They were now resolved on having revenge ou Mr
 Wilson, and all others who had reprobated their course
 Several hundred militia assembled on the 4th of October, with 'arms in their hands, and after participating in a violent meeting, paraded the streets
 It was whispered about that they intended to seize Mr
 Wilson, and they marched, for that purpose, to the City Tavern, expecting to h'nd him and his friends there
 Disappointed in this, they moved towards his residence, sit- uated at the south-west corner of Third and Walnut streets, under the lead of two desperate characters—Honham and Pickering
 Friends of Mr
 Wil- son, including General Mimin, General Thompson, Captain Campbell, and other Continental officers and Iriends, to the number of thirty or forty, i
ad gone to Mr
 Wilson's house to defend it
 They were all armed
 The mob approached, with drums beating, and dragging two pieces ol cannon, in a very threatening manner
 There is a conflict of testimony here—one ac- count saying that as the mob was passing the house, Captain Campbell (a one-armed veteran of Hazen's regiment), tired a pistol at them through an open window; and others, that the mob tired upon the house, and that the defenders responded
 Captain Campbell, ir
 the house, and an unknown per- son on the street, were killed
 The mob forced a door on the Third street side, but as they entered were met with a well-directed fire, which dropped several of them
 At this point, President llei-d appeared, followed by Major David Lenox,1 ut the head of a detachment of the City Troop, and succeeded in dispersing the mob
 Arrests were made on both sides, but there were no prosecutions, as the 
Assembly passed an act of free and general pardon
 After this, party contests were less violent

 ing Jersey in such a manner as to preserve an easy communication with Pennsylvania
 But West Point requires two thousand eight hundred men, and, for the Northern posts dependent on it and the necessary detachments below, a thousand more will not be an extrav- agant allowance
 I will suppose, then, that the army may be can- toned to answer these purposes in this manner: The eorps at West Point to remain there, and those under your Excellency's immedi- ate command to take post in Jersey
 But of the first, there will, on the first day of January remain little more than three thousand men; and, of the last, about two thousand four hundred
 Should those posted in Jersey be in the vicinity of the enemy, they would be liable to have their quarters beat up; they would probably have a new position to take, which may 1x2 very difficult in the winter season, and be exposed to the loss of their baggage and artillery, as it will not be possible to maintain the horses at the army
 Should they be removed to any considerable distance, in order to place them in greater security, they could not answer the purpose of cov- ering the country
 It is not probable that many recruits will have arrived by the first of January, be the measures of the States ever so decisive—a part, however, of the qnotas of Pennsylvania and Connecticut may, perhaps, be counted on, which is all, I appre lie:id, may be expected before the month of March, at soonest
 Should the troops be posted in the upper part of Jersey, or in the vicinity of West Point, the most valuable part of that State will be left entirely open to the enemy, the communication with Pennsyl- vania become more difficult, the carriage be greatly increased through a rough country, and where forage is not abundant
 Diffi- culties present themselves on all sides; but, on the whole, I think some middle station should be chosen, in Jersey, so situated as to be within a few hours' forced march, with light troops, of the Newark M mntain, which appears to me a barrier of considerable impor- tance; but I have not a sufficient local knowledge to be able to point out a particular place
 There will be a time when the army there, supposing that disposition should be thought proper, will be very weak; but then a body of the militia might be called out, which would not much interfere with their filling their battalions, as the number of men they would want is not considerable, and, from the season, not at all with the affairs of husbandry
 With them joined to the troops, there would be no great danger of any serious attempt from the enemy, from the distance they would have to penetrate into the country, and the difficulty of a retreat in case of misfortune

Page 491

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 491 But at West Point there are only the number of men necessary merely for the works, and, therefore, not a sufficient immber for its de- fense, should it be attempted in any other way than by a coupe de main
 It is not, however, probable that the enemy will sit down before it in the winter season, and, should that be their design, it must be discovered in time enough to throw in a reinforcement, and part of the York militia might also be called out without impeding the re- cruiting service, as their battalion are near complete
 On one hand the ease and comfort of the troops require their being cantoned as soon as possible; that their huts may be con- structed before the severity of the winter sets in; more especially when we reflect upon the state of their clothing
 Oil the other, until the winter is at least so far advanced as to preclnde the possi- bility of an attempt upon West Point
 But a serious attempt upon West Point, as I observed before, requires such previous prepara- tion as can not well Ix; concealed, and a body, I should suppose, of at least eight thousand men,and both sides of the river must be occupied, so that the probability is against its being made in the winter, when their communication with New York by water must be precarious
 There is no probability at all of their marching to it, as the means of transporting the apparatus for siege, and the nec- essary provisions are not, I believe, within their power
 I should, therefore, think that in a fortnight hence the camp may be broken up; but this will be, in some measure, governed by the weather
 After all, it must be owned that, should the enemy bend their force against the army I have supposed in Jersey, it would bo a haz- ardous situation; but, as they have discovered no inclination to at- tempt any thing of that kind since the detachments have been made from this army, and, whilst the season was favorable to military operations, it induces an expectation that they will not be more en- terprising, on great scale, at least, during the winter
1 1 am most clearly of opinion that no troops can be spared, at this time, for the southward; neither do I see any offensive operation 1The above observations were called for by General Washington, and in the disposition of the array for the winter, and the design upon Staten Island, were fully approved by tho Commander-in-Chief

 Dear Sir:—Your favor of the 3d inst

 The delicacy of giving any directions with respect to the clothing, which might in any respect interfere with the views of the General, in- duced us' to submit it entirely to Jiis direction
 In future we shall be on a more certain footing
 Your wishes to see harmony and good agreement prevail in time of public calamity, do honor to the goodness of your own heart

 I assure you I shall be so far from declining any overtures of that nature, that I shall cheerfully meet them
 Mr
 Wilson's understanding and abilities will always make him respectable, if he does not devote them too far to the purposes of party
 He is one whom no man would choose to wish for an enemy, and I believe it entirely depends on himself to increase the number of his friends
 When, as I hope is the case with us, party has not rankled into personal enmity, I flatter myself civility and society may be re- stored
 Time and mutual good dispositions alone can effect it

 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 MORRISTOWN, 21th January, 1780
 Dear Sir:—You will be pleased to repair to our lines and inves- tigate the causes of the late misfortune and disgrace at Elizabeth- towu, and report your opinion therenpon, as soon as inquiry is made
1 You will also examine into the state of our guards, and see if any change can be made in their position for the better; having respect, as far as present circumstances will allow, to the object in view, which are security to this camp, cover to the country near the en- emy's lines, and prevention of that injurious and abominable traffic, •which is carried on with the city of New York
 While you are in the discharge of this duty, it is my wish that you would obtain, in as unsuspected a manner as possible, a perfect knowledge of the enemy's strength, situation, and guards on Staten Island and at Paulus Hook, the state of the ice on the North River, and such other information as it may be beneficial and important for us to be 1 A detachment of British troops, commanded by Lientenant-Colonel Bushkirk, crossed over from Stutun Island ut Trembley's Point, and entered Elizabethtown between eleven and twelve o'clock, on the night of thn 2oth of January
 It consisted of one hundred dragoons, and between three und four hundred infantry
 They took several prisoners, burnt the meeting- house, town-house, and another building, plundered some of the inhabitants, and retired without loss
 A similar attack was made at the same time on a small party at Newark, and with equal success
 The academy was burnt
 In both places the surprise was complete

 Letter, January 6th
 On the same day the above letter was written, General Washington in- formed Colonel Hnzen that General StSt. Clair would go down in the morning to make an inquiry, and endeavor to find out if it would be possible to re- taliate on the enemv; and, if not, if some different position of the grounds might not be necessary
 He thought enterprises by small parties practicable, but the strength of the enemy would render too hazardous any thing moro extensive
 Since the North Itiver was passablo, he had thought it practica- ble to carry out the plan of Colonel Willett, for burning the enemy's trans- ports, which were supposed to be frozen in the ice at Turtle Hay
 Inquiry was to be made as to the fact of the boats being frozen up, first
 If, then, Colonel Willett should chouse to undertake it, he was to be indulged, and Washington recommended the selection of Webb's regiment, the men of which were clothed in red, as well caleulated for such an enterprise

 acquainted with
 It is my wish, also, that you may obtain a com- plete knowledge of the places and manner in which the enemy's shipping, flat-boats, and other craft are laid up and secured, thereby discovering whether some successful attempt, by stratagem or other- wise, may not be made to destroy them
 The relief which went down to the detachment under the command of Colonel Hazeu, when joined thereto, will form a body of two thousand rank and file; and as there were reasons for apprehending that the enemy had some offensive plan in view, which actually took place that very night, I ordered Colonel Hazen to remain there with his com- mand a few days, or till further orders
 You will please to take command of both detachments, and retain the old till the objects here enumerated arc fulfilled, unless you should think best to order the return of it to camp before
 If, in the course of your tour of duty below, and investigation of the enemy's posts, any operation upon a large or small scale presents itself, you will delay no time in communicating your ideas fully on the subject to me, provided, in the latter instance, a favorable opportunity is not lost by delay, in which case you are left altogether to your own discretion, bearing in mind always that new disappointments will add discredit to our anus
 But, while the state of the ice admits a free and easy pas- sage of troops from New York, any attempt otherwise than by sur- prise may be dangerous
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 CRANE'S MILLS, January 28, 1780
 »Sir:—I arrived at Colonel Hazen's quarters the night before last, and yesterday, with him, visited the several posts, which I found to be Rahway, Crane's Mills, Connecticut Farms, Elizabethtown, and Newark
 Elizabethtown and Newark are occupied by small de- tachments only, and guards are posted at De Hart's and Halsted Points
 A small guard is also kept at the New Blazing Star from the post at Rahway
 In this situation the troops are as compact as, I believe, the nature of the cantonment will allow consistently with the objects in view; yet they are far from being so much so as could be wished
 The dis- tance these different places lie from one another, and want of horse to communicate speedily any movements of the enemy, render it very easy to surprise one or other of the poste, particularly Rahway, which is only two miles from the Sound, and lies five miles from hence and five miles from the Blazing Star
 The small detached
Page 495

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 495 guara at that place may be very easily taken off; and then their flank, and even their rear, is entirely open
 To cover effectuallv such an extent of country as from Newark to Amboy, in the present state of the ice, would require a very con- siderable body of troops; and the dispersing them in small bodies, exposes them to many accidents, and greatly favors desertion, which, with much regret, I find has prevailed in these commands
 In Elizabethtown, I found a four days' guard, consisting of one hundred men, with a field officer
 This I reduced to a captain and fifty, to be relieved daily, which I thought would answer every pur- pose that could be expected from the hundred, as they may, when on for one day only, be kept constantly alert, and half of them at a time patroling during the night
 Indeed, I believe good patrols would answer every purpose better than small guards; but, where the distance betwixt posts is considerable, they should be composed of horse
 The guards at De Hart's and Halsted Points are cer- tainly much exposed, and if the enemy suffer them to remain, it must arise from extreme caution, or their having something of more importance in contemplation, for I can not suppose they want in- formation of our position
 I have not yet been able to ascertain the enemy's number on Staten Island, or at Paulus Hook, but expect to-day to have pretty good accounts of the last, as also of the state of the ice on both the North and East Rivers; but from all that I can learn, and from the intelligence Colonel Hazen has received, their numbers on the Is- land amount to two thousand and upwards
 The reinforcement thrown in from New York consisted of three regiments—supposed about seven or eight hundred men; part of them are cantoned, and part encamped about the middle of the island
 Intelligence is, however, very difficult to be obtained, and is not, in my opinion, in a good train; the person who seems to he most depended upon bear- ing a very bad character, and known to act as an agent for the enemy
 Indeed, it will be almost impossible to get it into another train, unless the intercourse betwixt the inhabitants and the island can be prevented; nor can a stop be put to the traffic carried on with the city, unless some other way of rewarding those we employ be fallen upon than countenancing it in their favor
 Nothing has yet presented itself to induce any attempt upon the enemy, which should at least have probability in its favor
 Their advanced picket at Dungan's Mills might be taken off, but it is a trifling object, and the retreat of the party might be prevented
 If any thing is to be done on the island, it must, I believe, be by open

>rce, which they seem to expect, as, from the information of a de- serter, they are improving their works and adding abatu, and keep their troops as close to them as possible
 They are also constructing a new work, with timbers, on a hill that commands the redoubt at the Watering Place
 There is at present a passage to New York, but it is frequently interrupted by the driving ice
 Dr
 Burnet expected a trusty, intelligent person from New York last night, and I shall see him to-day
 By him, I expect the inform- ation your Excellency wishes with respect to the East River, and the situation of the enemy's vessels
 If it favors Colonel Willet's enterprise, I shall desire him to wait upon your Excellency imme- diately
 I find, by an order of Gen
 Tryon's of the 13th, that a number of bateaux are to be laid up at Be Nuys's Ferry, at the Narrows
 I suppose Colonel Hazen has informed your Excellency of the at- tempt the enemy intended upon the detachment at Railway on Wednesday last, which was prevented by Colonel Gray's obtaining some notice of it
 I can not help repeating that horse are much wanted to give any degree of security to the cantonments; but, a one object is to cos-er and secure the inhabitants, they ought, some of them at least, to be furnished by the Htate, and if these were trusty, good men, acquainted with the country, they would make the best patrols possible
 I believe, too, they would more effectually check the spirit of traffic than it will ever be done by the soldiery, who hold it, in some measure, a disreputable employment
 I wish I could give your Excellency any hint that might help to check or prevent the shameful desertion that prevails, and for which the troops of Pennsylvania, especially, have so little reason
 It would, perhaps, answer a good end, while the ice continues firm, in- stead of detachments from the army, to send whole corps; the first to be taken from those lines where that vice has not crept in
 By the time one or two commands are completed, the communication will probably be more difficult
 I have inquired of every person I thought could give me proper information into the causes of our misfortune at Elizabethtown and Newark, and it appears to have been owing to negligence in not having the patrols out in proper time, and to their having fatigued themselves too much the night before; and it is certain that the captain had not a single vidette, nor even a sentry, on the stable where his horses were
 I am not quite satisfied whether your Excellency intended a formal inquiry, or that I should inform myself in the manner I

 Nothing further occurs at present
 If any intelligence of moment arises, it shall be immediately communicated; and I will detain Colonel Hazen until I hear from your Excellency

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON: CUANE'S MILLS, February 7, 1780
 Dear Sir 
'—Nothing extraordinary has happened since my last, neither have I received any intelligence of consequence, my man from New York not yet being returned; I expect to see or hear from him this evening
—It is said that in consequence of the report of some deserters who got into Paulus Honk from Connecticut Farms, the day before the detachment was relieved, that post is re- inforced every evening from New York
 If this be true, which I hope to ascertain to-day, a stroke may be made upon them
 The country was very much alarmed yesterday by the appearance of a party and a number of sleighs on the sound
 The report reached me as I was on my return from Wood bridge, with the addition that they were actually landed and in Elizabethtown, which occasioned the troops to be got under arms that were nearest
 It proved to be a party from New York, most probably carrying provisions; they came on the ice at Bergen Point, passed up towards De Hart's Point, about half way; and then turned off and landed near Deckers, on Staten Island
 The sleighs were in number about one hundred, and the escort consisted of about sixty infantry and twenty horses
 I have made some alteration in the disposition of the canton- ments
 The body of the troops now lie in a line from Springfield to the southern part of Westfield, with one hundred and twenty men advanced to Connecticut Farms, and the same number in this neighborhood; fifty men detached to Newark, and fifty to Wood- bridge
 The different parties of mounted militia are instructed to patrol the roads along the sound from Newark to Amboy; fifteen of them are stationed at Newark, fifteen at Rah way, and fifteen at Woodbridge
 These are a kind of volunteers who depend upon the Legislature for a reasonable compensation for their services
 As the people came very readily into this mode, and discovered
Page 499

 499 an unwillingness to engage in any other way, I declined raising the twentv your Excellency had empowered me, and if these forty-five, in the manner they are stationed, will do their duty, there is little doubt hut that, with the assistance of our foot patrols, every move- ment of the enemy will be timely discovered
 A son of Mr
 Hadden, who was lately made prisoner at Newark, waited upon me yesterday with a request from Mrs
 lladden, who has your Excellency's permission to go to New York, that your Ex- cellency would allow her to pass by Paulus Hook
 I promised him to mention it, and I believe there is no doubt but flags will bo re- ceived there
 Major Skinner went in that way, and a flag came from thence the day before yesterday with a letter for him, and by opening that comnHirunation, some useful observations may, per- haps, be made
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair

 Hadden to pass in by Paulas Hook, you will, therefore, grant her request; and make such further use of that communication in the way of flags, while the frost continues, as you may jndge essential for any pur- poses you may have in view, or for obtaining useful information
 I would imagine, however, that the enemy will object to this line, for the same reasons which we may desire it
 I have no objection to Kemp and Crane going over to Kingston; you may, therefore, indulge the friends of the persons who were lately taken in their application

 I have not been able to ascertain the force of the party that came to Elizabethtown
 The two persons that were made prisoners there seem entirely ignorant of it, and had followed the troops in order to plunder
 Their numbers are said to have been two thous- and, which is improbable; but from General Sterling and General Skinner, both being [unintelligible], they must have been consid- erable
 A number of houses in the town have been stripped of every thing, and ten or twelve of the inhabitants carried off
 The party at Woodbridge committed no outrage of any kind upon either the persons or houses of the inhabitants, but carried off about thirty head of cattle
 Their principal aim seems to have been the guard, and, missing of that, they stayed a very short time
 On their retreat they were followed by the horse patrols, some of the militia, and the troops, who say they wounded several, but none were left on the ground
 The party that landed at Rah way, in a very obscure place, plundered two houses and carried off two men, and seemed to have had no other object
 But the surprising a party of fifty men seemed too trifling to have been the design of so large a party as that at Eli/
abethtowu
 Whatever it may have been, the finding the guard so alert probably induced them to de- sist
 The party from Paulus Hook consisted of about three hun- dred horse, and landed at Hackensack
 The person I had sent to New York, and who had been detained at Paulus Hook in conse- quence of orders the day before, to suffer no person to go out, came over with them
 They proceeded some distance into the country, and from the route they pursued, he thinks, intended to have passed the Cedar Swamp, and were very particular in their inquiries about the situation of your quarters, and where I was quartered, and the guards that were posted between Hackensack and Morristown
 He says particularly that, after marching some way into the country, he heard an officer ask the commandant where they were going
 He replied he could not tell him that, but they had more than thirty miles to march that night; that in a short time after this, finding the snow very deep and the roads not broken, they returned, and he was dismissed
 If their design was an attempt on your Excellency's quarters, the other party's were intended to divert our attention from that party of horse that were to have marched upon our left flank, and I hope you will pardon me for hinting that there is not a sufficient body of troops near enough to render you secure
 Had they been designed
Page 501

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 501 to have fallen upon our rear, which they might have clone, they had troops enough to have given us full occupation, and them the op- portunity
 But supposing either of these designs, it is difficult to account for their retiring so soon, without even attacking the Eliza- bethtown guard, which was not above a quarter of a mile out of town
 The person from New York, says that the East River is still open; and, in general, gives the same account of the situation of the ship- ping guards and quarters of the general officers as I had the honor to transmit to your Excellency in a former letter
 His account of Paulus Hook is an accurate one
 It consists of a pretty large re- doubt, with a smaller one within it, capable of containing about one hundred and fifty
 The barracks about ten rods without the works, abatised to the landside; but not to the water, and not one piece of cannon planted that way
 The garrison consists of about six hundred men, from which they detach daily a sergeant's guard to the Green Island, about a mile from the Hook, and lower down the river; and that they have ceased to send the reinforcements I men- tioned before for some days
 I have had no authentic intelligence from Staten Island for some days, and, indeed, it is very difficult to obtain
 The inhabitants in general cry out so much against Morris Hat- field that I have not employed him, and they are all afraid of being detected by his brothers on the Island
 I expect, however, to hear from there by to-morrow night, and if it is of consequence, will transmit it immediately to your Excellency
 I still think Buskirk's corps may be taken off
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, MORRISTOWN, 12//i Feb
, 1780
 Dear Sir:—I received yours of yesterday late last night
 I am pleased to find that the vigilance of your guards and patrols disap- pointed the enemy, whatever might have been their intentions
 I have taken precautions to guard against an attempt by such a party as might be reasonably supposed to be able to reach this in the course of a night, and I hope that a short continuance of this weather will make the ice impassable by horse; from foot, there is no danger at this distance
 If you still think an attempt upon Buskirk's corps practicable, you are at full liberty to try the experiment
 I am confident you

 will undertake nothing but what will be justified by appearances and a probability of success
 P
 S
 As the enemy have made an incursion with their horse by the way of Hackensack, will it not be prudent in you to extend your patrols of horse more to vour left while the ice is passable? When- ever persons apply for liberty to go within the enemy's line, having the permission of the Executive of any of the States, Congress, or the Board of War, you may suffer them to pass without an applica- tion to me
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 SPRINGFIELD, Feb
 20, 1780
 Sir:—The enemy made another attempt last night, about eleven o'clock, to surprise the party at Newark, and plunder the town, but, being happily discovered on their approach by the patrols, the guard and the inhabitants were alarmed, and obliged them to retire with- out their effecting any thing except carrying off two men, one of whom is supposed to have purposely thrown himself in their way
 There was some firing betwixt their advance and the patrols, but without loss on our side, or, I believe, on theirs, though it is said that some of them were wounded
 The guard retired to a height in the rear of the town, until they discovered the strength of the party, which consisted of about one hundred foot, when, being joined by the inhabitants, they moved down to attack them
 The enemy immediately retired, and were pursued to the river, where they were obliged to quit about twenty head of cattle they had collected, and some horses, and I hear of nothing missing but one sheep and an old horse
 The ice still remains passable, both in Hackensack and Second Rivers, and in Newark Bay, and the Sound, but with some difficulty, there being many places, particularly in the Bay and Sound, that will support very little weight
 I believe the North River, though still fast, will not admit the passage of troops
 Whilst they remain in that situation, perhaps the post at Paulus Hook might be attempted with probable success, as, from the intelligence I have, they are not very vigilant there; the garrison does not now exceed five hundred men, and, if I am rightly informed, the place is entirely open to the North River
 I think there is no doubt but that the ice upon the Flats will be strong enough for some time, unless the weather should alter, and guides

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 503 may be procured to conduct a proper party clear of the inhabitants
 The detachment here might be sufficient, for, if it is carried, it might be by surprise, and, in that case, numbers are of no great avail
 I have not yet, however, such information as to enable m° to digest a plan of attack, but am in hopes to receive it to-night, and shall immediately communicate it to your Excellency
 There is not much time to lose, but the critical moment is that in which the ice is sufficiently strong along shore, when it is too weak in the North and Sound

 Sir:—I have this moment received yours1 of seven o'clock
 I apprehend, with you, that the circumstances you mention will pre- vent the execution of your project; for which reason, and the bad- ness of the weather, I delay the march of the covering party till I hear further from you
 If the intelligence you expect proves favor- able, I shall be obliged to you to dispatch a second messenger, and I will take measures here accordingly

 MORIUSTOWN, 8th March, 1780
 Gentlemen:—The jxnvers herewith authorize you to proceed to Amboy, on the flth instant, to meet commissioners on the part of the enemy, for the purpose of settling a general cartel
 You will perceive what has been already done in this business by the papers 1 Missing
 2General StSt. Clair ordered Colonel Sherman to assemble his brigade nt West field, on t IIP even ins of theL'Jid, whence he was to march to Springfield, so as to arrive there at eight o'clock; all of the guards were to be culled in except those at Rahway and AVoodbridgo; the men were to bo marched completely equipped, but without their pucks, and cuch mun was to be furnished with u gill of rum
 These orders were carried out, but the enterprise had to be abandoned at the last moment, on account of its having been ascertained that the enemy had been apprised of the intended movement, and was pre- pared

 accompanying this
 The only instructions I have to give you are these: That you transact nothing under your commission but upon principles of perfect equality and on a national ground
 If the en- emy will not treat with you on this footing, you will put an end to the negotiations
 But, after your official business is over, I wish you, in private conversation, to enter into a discussion of the pro- posals, so as to remove any difficulties they contain, and prepare the way for some future particular agreement, which may give re- lief to our officers and men in captivity
 If you enter into a general cartel, you must of necessity include the southern prisoners; but, if you are obliged to confine yourselves to what I now recommend, you will avoid including them
 The proposals appear to me generally liberal, though, in some respects, exceptionable
 The tariff, however, is moderate enough
 Having entire confidence in your judgment and discretion, I think it un- necessary to cuter into a detail of the exceptionable parts; persuaded that they will readily occur to you, and that you will take proper steps to have them amended
 The settlement of accounts is a point of importance and difficulty
 As the mutter now stands, I am unable to give you any explicit directions on the subject
 If you are likely to enter into a general cartel, you will immediately advise me, and I will obtain further instructions from Congress
 If this is not the case, you will hardly be able to draw any engagements from the enemy on this head, and you will perceive this point is not to be made a preliminary nor ultimatum
 You will do the best you can, en- deavoring, by all means, to engage the British Commissioners to ad- vance u sufficient sum of money to pay the debts of our officers for board a:ul the like, and enable them to leave their captivity
 You will communicate to me, from time to time, any matters you may desire my advice upon, and it shall cheerfully be afforded
 I sincerely wish you a successful and honorable issue to your commission
1 1The convention failed, as had been foreseen
 In communicating the formal report of tho American Commissioners to Congress, March 31st, General Washington alluded to the report transmitted by the Minister of France, that, on account of the difficulty in procuring men in Germany, the British Court had instructed Sir Henry Clinton to treat with General Washington, on national grounds
 Tho unreliability of this report was shown by tho re- sult of tho Convention at Amboy
 Therefore, following Washington's in- structions, the commissioners refused to treat on any other grounds
 The British Commissioners insisted on the exehango being, at all events, extended to one half of the Second Division of the Convention troops
 General Washington sni>J he would carry cut such a plan if Congress ordered it, but he asked to bo excused from deciding it

 505 GENERAL PHILLIPS1 TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 AMBOY, March 20th, 1780
 Sir:—I entered upon the commission which is now ended, prom- ising myself there would be derived from it real advantages to the unlucky sufferers of both armies by a general exchange; unsuccess- so many men will bo of great moment to the enemy, if they meet with success at the southward; on the other, I tee not how wo shall bo able to maintain our officers in captivity, and the expense is no trifling considera- tion
" General Phillips reported to Lord George Germain: "This attempt for a general cartel and exchange has proven ineffectual, as every former one liad done founded on an objection to the powers given by Sir Henry Clinton; nnd your Lordship will directly observe the groat object of the American Congress is to work so:no public act, in which General Washington may be concerned with Sir Henry Clinton in character of equality with Great Brit- ain, on the principles of nation against nation at war; and the positive dec- laration, of tho American Commissioners on this matter fully evinces the fact, and that a general cartel can r
ever take place on any other ground, which, it may be imagined, will never be suffered by Great Britain
 In a number of attempts to release the troops of Convention, the matter was broken off under several descriptions
 At one time, tho American Congress would not exchange the troops in corps; at another, they were willing to exchange private soldiers to a certain number, but it was never understood what number or in what manner
 Interested, as I have been, it has led me to hold conversations with a number of American officers, proving to them that tho troops of Convention stood under a particular description, and that exchanging tho officers without the men against American offic-ers, prison- ers of war could not bo considered as equal, the American officers going to an immediate activity of service, and the Convention officers not doini* so as the regiments to which they belonged would still bo in captivity; and, however eligible and convenient for the officers themselves, it would be of no advantage to tho King's service
" 1William Phillips, Major-Goneral in the British army, who commanded the artillery under General Borgoyne in the investment of Ticondcroga
 Ho hud won distinction as a soldier in Germany, and from his experience thero quickly saw tho importance of having possession of Sugar-Loaf Hill, in tho work of reducing the forts on Lake Champlain
 He took part in tin; battles of Bonus's Heights, and was made a prisoner at Saratoga
 The troops surrendered there under the terms agreed on between General Gaies and General Burgoyne, were called Convention Troops, and were com- manded by General Phillips on their march to Virginia
 General Phillips was actively engaged in tho South after his exchange, and died of bilious fever at Bollingbrook, on tho James River, Mth May, 1781, one year after tho correspondence with StSt. Clair, while General La Fayetto was investing tho place
 It is claimed, by British chroniclers, that fchot pushed through
Page 506

506 The StSt. Clair Papers
 ful prosecution of that matter, the papers composing the minutes of our proceedings will explain
 I felt great satisfaction, however, at the proposition which was made by you and Lieutenant-ColoneLs Carrington and Hamilton to enter into a private conversation upon the subject of exchanges, and to try if it might not be possible to bring that purpose to bear un- der an usual and customary mode by letters between the two Com- manders-in-Chief, witlout any future appointment of commission- ers, which seems to have retarded rather than have hastened a business so very essential to the number of suffering individuals
 I am sure, sir, your candor will allow that I, as well as Lieutenant- Colonels Gordon and Norton, entered into your idea with the utmost cheerfulness, and I apprehend it was mutually agreed upon to con- verse upon the matter dispassionately, and to endeavor at removing those difficulties which might appear to act against a general ex- change, in which the troops of Convention were to be connected
 I allow this to have been done to a certain degree, when it became necessary for us to make a proposition that might fix certain stated points of time and characters, and put the matter upon a future in- disputable footing
 This drew from you, sir, a paper which you held to us as an ultimatum on your part,1 that was so contrary to our expectations and seemed so little calculated to answer the good purposes proposed, that it forced us reluctantly to become silent upon a business which we found so very unlikely to be brought to any desirable issue
 I can not suffer you to depart from this place without making an observation or two upon the paper you delivered to me; and, in the first instance, I must be allowed to remark that Lieutenant-Gover- nor Hamilton " is placed in a description of exchange which had never the house where General Phillips was dying, and that when La Fayette's attention was called to it, he refused to desist
 This, however, is not true
 General Phillips was buried in the old Blandford church-yard, from which his remains were never removed
 His correspondence with StSt. Clair dis- played a humane sentiment highly creditable
 1This was in accordance with the determination of Washington not to treat on any but terms of absolute equality
 It was also important that the Hritish army should not bo speedily reinforced with the Convention troops
 Hence, technicalities were more strenuously insisted on than they would have been, probably, under other circumstances
 2Henry Hamilton, Lieutenant-Governor of Canada, was captured at Post Vinccnne*, by George Rogers Clarke, on tho occasion of his expedition to the North-west
 Hamilton and several of his chief officers were sent as prisoners to Williamsburg, Virginia, where, on account of their alleged com-
Page 507

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 507 been a part of our conversation on that subject; the proposition for his being released was mutual, and we offered to your view, at the same time, several officers who were in the same situation with him- self; but the Lieutenant-Governor and these officers were always included in our conversation, to be exchanged against such of your officers, prisoners of war, as might be in Georgia; and never, in any time of our discourse, came into a calculation of that plan of exchange which comprehended the American officers prisoners of war in these parts
 The paper contains, in the second instance, a long interwoven matter, in the body of which is expressed, that the balance of offi- cers, if any, after a discussion of certarn points, shall be applied, as far as they will go, towards an exchange of the second division of the troops of Convention; but, Sir, the points, to be discussed sur- round this offer in such a manner as to put out of question any possible operation
 The persons who may be produced under no present certain description, and of Canadians who have been pro- duced, must necessarily involve the matter in such a perplexed dis- cussion as would, in course, prevent the troops of Convention from receiving any advantage from the American officers, prisoners of war, in Georgia, as described within the period of the 31st of De- cember, 1779
 In the prosecution of an exchange on our part, the first object has invariably been, the officers and soldiers, prisoners of war; after them the troops of Convention, by corps; but in pursuing the lat- ter, the greatest attention must be observed to avoid, not only the reality, but the appearance also, of partiality, and that in exchang- ing the first division the greatest care must be had to give effect to the exchange of those corps whose unlucky lot has put them into a second division; and it is necessary, also, that, after having agreed to your proposal, that certain general officers should go with each division
 It should never be conceived those general officers would suffer themselves to be exchanged without a due considera- tion for the troops, and under such- a description of numbers as plicity in inciting the Indians to murderous attacks on the frontiers, they were thrown into jail and heavily ironed
 Governor Jefferson finally or- dered them released from their confinement, but the wrath of the people would not bo appeased, On account of the claim of the State of Virginia to the control of Hamilton, General Washington could not authorize tho Commissioners to recognize him as a prisoner of the United Colonies on the occasion under consideration

Page 508

508 The StSt. Clair Papers
 might prevent any possibility of a seeming partiality, or a desire of being exchanged unconnected with the officers and soldiers
 The first division under the description is free of any doubt, but the operation of the second would bear a little hard upon my char- acter, positively so upon my feelings, if I did not contend, even to a risk of the loss of my own liberty, that a proper and suitable num- ber of officers and men should be absolutely exchanged with me, and a view left open for the future exchange of the rest, when there may be American prisoners of war in Sir Henry Clinton's hands, to enable him to propose an exchange for the remainder of them
 This might be done, I apprehend, consistent with the feelings and the honor of the troops of Convention, and of their general officers, supposing the proposition made by myself, Lieutenant-Colonels Gor- don and Norton had been accepted, by which the balance of Amer- ican prisoners of war in these parts joined with the American pris- oners of war in South Carolina and Georgia, to the 31st of Decem- ber, 1779, would go to the release of the troops of Convention, as far as they applied; the release of the remainder would depend upon the future operations of the war; and, although they might have occasion to lament their ill-fortune, would acknowledge the impartiality of the conduct used towards them, the corps being ex- changed by lot, and the general officers in a proportion with those corps
 Had any exchange taken place, I should have contended that, after leaving a proper number of officers with each remaining corps of troops of Convention, the others might have had the liberty of going to Europe upon their paroles, under the stipulation that American officers made prisoners of war might have their paroles, also, agreeable to the terms of the proposal signed by me and the four American officers
 Having, thus far, explained to you my sentiments, I am free to declare to you that I think an exchange might have taken place, had not such particular terms been proposed as have put it out of my power, individually, to offer them as a man of honor, and so in- timately connected with the exchange, to his Excellency, General Henry Clinton, and I am of the opinion an exchange may still take place, should you incline to recede from the particular articles which have combined to form the difficulty
 I shall, at all times, be ready to meet you, personally, at Elizabethtown or Stateu Island, and endeavor, with the consent of our superiors, to bring this very interesting matter to a happier conclusion than we have now been able to do

 509 I feel great pleasure in having met you, Sir, and beg to testify the greatest esteem for your very polite conduct towards me and the other gentlemen
 You will, in course, consider this a private letter
 MAJOR-GENERAL PHILLIPS TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 AMBOY, March 22d, 17SO
 Sir:—When your leisure will allow you to examine the compara- tive views of the officers who are on parole of the British and American armies, you will perceive that, exclusive of some char- acters on both sides, for whom no estimate has been made, there re- mains a balance in favor of Mr
 Lo,ring, British Commissionary- General of prisoners, of forty-eight numbers, equal to something more than a major and a captain
 Having had very much at heart, for a long time, the situation of Major Haruage and Captain Hawker, of the Sixty-second British Regiment, belonging to the troops of Convention, the former of whom has a family, I am to request the favor of your interposition with General Washington that these officers may be allowed the liberty of going immediately upon their paroles to New York
 The principles of liberality, exclusive of the equality of parole exchanges, give me, I apprehend, a just claim for naming these officers upon this occasion, and I am sure I need not say more upon the subject, being fully convinced they will be admitted upon their paroles
 It becomes necessary for me in this public letter, to give the same fair and honorable discription, as I hope I have done in every part relating to our commission, of what respects Lieuteuant-Governor Hamilton
 Unacquainted with what rank he might hold in the army, and uncertain whether he derived any military rank from being Lieu- tenant-Governor of Detroit, I wrote to those persons and charac- ters at New York who have a right to govern me in my transactions relating to that gentleman, and if his exchange had fortunately be- come a matter for our decision, I should have been fully competent to decide of what value he might be estimated in the tariff we have used in our calculations on this subject; but that being out of the question, I now offer, from motives of humanity on my part (which I have no doubt will govern you in your report of this matter to General Washington), that if Licutenant-Governor Hamilton, Major Hay, Captain La Motte, and Mr
 Justice Dejean be sent in upon
Page 510

510 The StSt. Clair Papers
 their paroles to New York, Colonel Mathews, an American prisoner of war on Long Island, shall be admitted to go out on parole for them
 It is to be understood, at the same time, that this does not determine or bear on the question of rank, but that we are acting merely from motives of compassion to suffering individuals, in en- deavoring to afford them, although not exchanged, the comfort of being with their respective friends
 Should I, by accident, have omitted the name or description of any person capitulated for by Lieutenant-Governor Hamilton, and with him a prisoner of war, I request, through your interposition, the favor of General Washing- ton's consideration for such person or persons, that they may be per- mitted to go into New York upon parole, and I give my full assur- ance that adequate ranks from the American prisoners of war shall be sent out for them
 I will not tire you with a recapitulation upon paper of the various conversations we have had on the subject of exchanges of prisoners of war, the troops of Convention being ertirely out of the question, more than to assure you that I believe whenever his Excellency, General Washington, will permit it, the American officers, prisoners of war, violators of parole, to be admitted iwto an immediate ex- change (provided only they can not be sent into New York), that a general exchange of the prisoners of war on both sides might take place
 I can not but feel much satisfaction that although this meeting of British and American Commissioners has ended like that of former interviews of the same nature, it has, however, served to describe the matter of a general exchange in such a manner as to offer a number of preliminaries to a fair and honorable view, and I most sincerely hope, as I am convinced you do, sir, that some more fortunate (they can not be more zealous) persons may be employed on so humane a purpose
 I will add only one more paragraph to this long letter
 It is a wish that, in the unfortunate contest between Great Britain and America, the professional character of liberality and humanity usual among military men, may be preserved and adhered to, upon all occasions where those feelings may operate to render individuals less unfortunate
 I can not conclude without assuring you, sir, of the great satisfaction I have had in meeting you, and it is with great pleasure, as with great truth, that I declare how very much I esteem the fairness and liberality which has governed your conduct during the present meeting

 511 GENERAL STSt. Clair
 TO GENERAL PHILLIPS
 CAMP NEAR MORRISTOWN, April 3, 1780
 Sir:—I have now the pleasure to acknowledge the receipt of the three letters you did me the honor to write on the 20th, 22d and 29th1 ultimo, and should not have so long delayed the acknowledg- ment of the first two had it been earlier in my power to have given you a satisfactorv answer; that of the 29th came not to hand until yesterday
 I am happy to inform you that the American Commissarv of Prisoners has received General Washington's orders to signify to Major Harnage and Captain Hawker that they have his permission to go to New York on parole, as their situation will thereby be ren- dered less irksome to themselves, and it will afford some gratification to you
 The General can not accede to the proposal respecting Governor Hamilton, and the gentlemen inclnded with him, in the capitulation with Colonel Clarke
 Although their release would have been con- sidered in a general exchange, he does not think himself at liberty to make them the objects of a particular parole exchange, as they are claimed as prisoners by the State of Virginia; besides, the re- turn on your part appears to him unequal
 It was extremely obliging in vou to interest yourself in favor of Mr
 Randolph and Mr
 Fitzhugh
 His Excellency will give the necessary orders that Lord Torphicen and Lientenant Hnd- son may go into New York on parole, and will consider these gen- tlemen as opposed to them for the present, but he chooses to limit the stay of Mr
 Randolph and Mr
 Fitzhugh to a certain period; and it is expected that when they return to New York (if the British officers should not be recalled), that two other American officers of the same rank with Lord Torphicen and Mr
 Hadden, and the oldest in captivity, will be immediately liberated on the same conditions
 It did not occur to me that the stipulation with respect to Chap- lains had not been signed by the respective Commissaries of Prison- ers, but it was fully understood, and Mr
 Beatty has now orders to interchange with the British Commissary a certificate that the Chaplains belonging to either army, when taken, are not to be con- sidered as prisoners of war, but are to be immediately released
 If the persons agreed to be exchanged at Amboy, and opposed to the Americans who have been sent to Elizabethtown in consequence, 1 Missing

Page 512

512 The StSt. Clair Papers
 are not yet sent on, he will again have orders to return them with all possible dispatch
 Inclosed is a passport for Mr
 Bibby
 What the result of our conversations at Amboy may be I can not determine, but the desire I have, with you, to give relief to the sufferers of both armies, in- duces a wish that they may produce the hoped-for effect; but it will be yet some time before that can be known
 Whatever it may be, it is the duty, as it can not but give pleasure to every humane and liberal man,to alleviate, as much as possible, the distresses of un- fortunate individuals in this unhappy contest
 As far as my influ- ence or example reaches, it shall ever be my care
 It is very flattering to me that my conduct on the late Commis- sion met your approbation, and I thank you for the very civil men- tion you have been pleased to make of it
 I should be wanting in sincerity and politeness if I did not assure you that the satisfaction was mutual, and that nothing would give me more pleasure than to meet you again, and be an instrument in bringing to a happy issue a business in which humanity in general and your own present feel- ings are so much interested
 P
 S
—I forgot to mention that I think there is little reason to expect any change with respect to those who have broken their paroles
 All of them that can be come at will certainly be sent in; but I believe General Washington will never be brought to give them a preference in exchange, which he can not help considering as annexing a reward to a perfidious breach of honor
 GENERAL PHILLIPS TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW YORK, April 8th, 1780
 Sir:—I yesterday received your letter dated the 3d inst
, and am much obliged to you for the attention you have paid to my ettcrs, which you mark to have received
 The passport for Mr
 Bibby came too late by forty-eight hours, but I shall, however, send him to Sir Henry Clinton by the first opportunity of a ship's sailing to the southward, and, perhaps, before that hapjwns you may be able to write a little more explicitly than you have done upon the subject of our conversations after the Commission had broken up, for, if I recollect rightly, you were to have sent me some little idea how far you had impressed a certain body at Philadelphia with the likeli- hood of exchanges taking place under certain descriptions of private conversations between you and me

Page 513

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 513 The paragraph of your letter relating to Messrs
 Randolph and Fitzhugh's returning, and for other officers being, then, sent out, is very reasonable, and there can be no doubt about it
 I am sorry there appears no likelihood of a present exchange of officers, pris- oners of war; for, you may depend upon it that, until the violators of parole are accounted for on your part, no other American officers, prisoners of war, will be exchanged, and it leads me to observe *o you, that, in a review of the violators of parole, there appears a number of names, particularly in the rank of lieutenant, of per- sons taken at Fort Washington, who are undoubtedly within the same degree of exchange with any others on Long Island taken at that time, and I imagine if you will talk with Mr
 [ ] upon the subject he will explain it to you
 I allow that the violators of pa- role do not deserve reward for what you properly term a "perfidious breach of honor," but I must be of the opinion that a stricture upon the conduct of these persons refers to them only, not to us, and that we have an undoubted right to hold their persons in actual captivity, or that they should be exchanged
 I can not but much wonder you do not wish to get rid of them in that manner, more es- pecially as you can not be ignorant of my being informed of the real state of your prisoners of war on Long Island, who can not be released without paying their debts for subsistence, which can never be held as entirely private, considering their public characters
 I have no doubt of all the proceedings between the Commissaries of Prisoners, under our direction at Amboy, being carried into execu- tion, and I request you will make my compliment of thanks to Gen- eral Washington for his indulgence to Major Harnage and Captain Hawker
 This letter is carried out of New York by Major Von Stein, of Lieutenant-General Knyphaussen's regiment, a prisoner of war on
 parole here, and included in the estimate signed by the two Com- missaries of Prisoners
 He returns to Pennsylvania with money for the German officers, but particularly to settle his own private ac- counts, which he left undischarged there, when he came in upon parole
 This officer will, in course, have liberty to return into New York after he shall have settled his business, but, should he prefer re- maining among his fellow-sufferers, I shall, in a future letter, name two captains in his place which will fill the measure of the estimate of the officers on parole before mentioned to have been agreed upon by the two Commissaries of Prisoners
 I am very happy in thus corresponding with you
 Much good 33

 Sir:—I have been favored with both your letters of the 8th inst
, and am very sorry that the passport for Mr
 Bibby did not arrive in time
 It was sent as soon as possible after the receipt of your for- mer letter
 However, from the delay, he may be able to carry with him the result of our conversations, with the intentions of Congress thereupon, which you will be made acquainted with as soon as they are known to the General
 It gives me great pain that the exchange of those persons who have violated their paroles should, in the first instance, be so stren- nously insisted on, as I see but little probability of the proposal that has been made respecting them, on our part, being receded from
 Any number of such, however, that were captured at Fort Washington, there will be no difficulty about, as they must be, at least, as early prisoners in their respective ranks as any, and Mr
 Beatty will have directions to exchange them
 It is very true any strictures upon these people's conduct can refer to them only, nor do I dispute the right you have to insist upon their exchange, or holding them in actual captivity; yet
 the exchanging them in pref- erence to others who have preserved their faith and honor, holds out a strong temptation to the violation of both
 I took the earliest opportunity to present your thanks to General Washington respecting Major Harnage and Captain Hawker, and to mention Mr
 Pausch to him
 He very readily consented to Mr
 Pausch's going into New York on parole, on account of the relation in which he stands to his Ex- cellency, General Knyphausseu; but he does not approve of Mr

 For the present, however, Mr
 "Williamson will not be ordered back; but, he thinks, when particu- lar characters are wanted, on one part or the other, out of the general line of exchanges, there should be previous notice and agreement between the Commissaries
 I find myself extremely happy in your correspondence, both from the humane purpose of it, and the great respect I bear you per- sonally, and have to regret that it must for some time be interrupted, as I am this day setting out on a visit to my family
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 1 CAMP, July 3, 1780
 The reduction of New York, together with the British army, is certainly, of all others, the most desirable object, but the seige of any place, although not regulary fortified, furnished with such a 1 To drive the British out of New York wus the object always uppermost in Washington's mind
 In 1779, he had hoped to do a stroke upon the enemy there, but circumstances did not admit of it
 Now
 that La Fayette had brought word from the Court of Franco that the Colonies would be sus- tained vigorously and efficiently by the King's army, navy, and money and that the Count de Rochambeau was on his way with a fleet, Washington re- curred to the purpose nearest his heart, and invited the suggestions of Gen- eral StSt. Clair as to the plan of campaign
 Hence the letter above
 It will be seen that, while StSt. Clair presented a comprehensive plan of attack (which Washington approved of and mainly adopted, as will bo seen by reference to his letters to Congress, La Fayette, and Greene) he did not regard the undertaking as feasible as a combined movement against Canada
 In this, he touched La Fayette in a tender place
 It was a favorite scheme of tho Frenchman, that of reconquering Canada and restoring tho power of the monarchy in the North, only second to that of giving freedom to the Colo- nies
 But whether he had impressed his views on StSt. Clair, or whether the latter, recalling his early military experience, and knowing that the posses- sion of that country would be the most effectual method for destroying British power in America, is not known Nevertheless, he pressed the mili- tary movement on Washington's attention, and was supported by both La Fayette and Gates
 Washington and Congress were averse to it for politi- cal reasons only
 They doubted the wisdom of a policy which might bring about complications with France when the day of adjustments should arrive
 It seemed cruel to let a shadow of suspicion against the French fall upon the devoted and pure La Fayette
 "God grant," wrote ho to Washington, in 1779, "that the sun of freedom may at length arise for the happiness of -mankind
" "Serving America is to my heart an inexpressible happiness
" It will bo seen that not only was the Canadian invasion scheme abandoned, but the attack on New York failed

516 The StSt. Clair Papers
 garrison as New York will be, is a very serious business, and though- the enterprise may succeed, it has not that degree of certainty which in our circumstances should induce the undertaking it
 The failing- in some lesser operation might be very disastrous, but in one of that magnitnde, it would go near to ruin Us
 The force in New York and its dependencies is estimated at 8,000 effective rank and file; militia and refugees, 5,000; returned with Sir Henry Clinton, 3,000 (or 2,500); total, 1G,000
 To offset these, we have, exclusive of the garrison of West Point, which, in case of an attempt upon New York, may be reduced to 500, 7,500; recruits may possibly come in to the amount of 6,000; and the French may be, perhaps, set at 8,000; total, 21,500
 With this force, possession is to be obtained of New York Island, which will, most probably, be very warmly disputed with us, and may lessen our numbers considerably for the campaign
 But I will suppose that with 20,000 effective men, we have got footing on the Island; still, that number will be found insufficient to the purpose, because its operations must be directly against New York, or it must be divided to act at the same time on Long Island, which may give the enemy an opportunity to make a stroke at either, and their succeeding against either, defeats the designs of the whole
 But still further, all prospect of success depends upon the command of the water,1 and however answerable our force may appear to the purpose, it should be reduced to a certainty that the enemy, during the course of the siege (which may be expected to be of no small duration), can not oblige the fleet to abandon us
 But, supposing the point fixed, that the naval force is sufficient, would it not be a better way to distress the enemy, to operate in some distant section with a part of the troops and shipping, and keep them blocked in New York with the rest? Canada is an ob- ject of considerable importance, and the loss of it would be felt very sensibly
 The troops of that country are valuable, and the friendship of almost all the savages on the continent depends upon it
 The troops for its defense are not numerous, and the disposition of the inhabitants may, I believe, be depended on
 If a body of troops, equal, perhaps, to the whole force in Canada, was to enter that country by Colonel Hazen's road, and another body of the French, of about the same strength, which should carry with them all the necessary apparatus for the whole, with a few ships of war, should enter it by the St
 Lawrence, their junction (supposing no 1 That the blockading fleet should be superior to the British, was indispen- sable

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 517 accident to happen the fleet before Quebec), would not be difficult, 
and the reduction of the country the almost certain consequence
 Even a greater force than I shall mention might be spared and enough left to preserve the blockade; and, indeed, it would, per- haps, not be improper that the body which enters Canada by band should be stronger than I have proposed
 If the exertions of the States should produce a very considerable reinforcement to our army, and the naval superiority of France be ascertained, another detachment of troops and ships might be made to operate against Halifax, which place, should the harbor be found too much fortified for the vessels to attempt to force the passage, may, nevertheless, be carried by the land, as there are many con- venient places for landing at no great distance from it, and where there are good harbors—La Mure, particularly, on the Halifax side, which runs up, if my memory serves me, within fifteen miles, and several on the Bay of Fundy
 I have said a few ships of war should enter the St
 Lawrence; these, I think, need be no other than frigates, and may be very safe against a much superior force by occupying the Island of Condre,1 which lays immediately below the traverse, where the passage of the river is narrow and difficult, and no anchorage until vou get above the lower point of it
 A simple frigate in Penobscot will prevent the withdrawing the troops there, as I believe they can not march from there to any part of Nova Scotia
 St
 Augustine will probably fall into the hands of the Spaniards, and the army under General Gates, though there is little probability that it can recover Carolina, may, however, check Lord Cornwallis, and perhaps oblige him to act on the defensive
2 These are my thoughts on the matters your Excellency was pleased to refer to me, and to all, or some of these points, our views and preparations should be principally directed; but how our finan- ces and the resources of the country may accord with them, I can not determine
 Canada can furnish wheat in great abundance, but little flour, and no meat
 The blockade of the British army if it can be effected, whilst our operations are carried on with vigor in some more distant quarter, would do them as much injury in Europe as the reducing them by force
 It would render them ridiculous in the mean time, and 1 In the St

 might end in a submission, whilst it would effectually prevent the 6clat that attends a vigorous and well-directed defense
 GENERAL ST
 OLAIR TO GENERAL WASHINGTON CAMP, July \2th, 1780
 The fleet having entered the bay of New York, and that city be- ing the object, it appears necessary to pass some vessels of force above the Narrows, in order to oblige the enemy to discover their intentions with regard to Staten Island
 If they do not mean to dispute the possession of it, their garrison will be withdrawn in- stantly; but it may be that they may choose to sacrifice some part of the troops on that island, with a view to retard your operations
 In either case, I think that island must be taken possession of and a junction formed upon it with the French troops, the debarkation of which, if the enemy keep possession, may be so regulated as to be made at the same instant that such part of this army as your Ex- cellency shall think proper crosses to it; which will necessarily in- duce a division of the enemy's force, and render the
 resistance feeble against both—or, reduce them to suffer you to land without opposi- tion
 The commencing our operations from Staten Island will save so much transportation that it becomes an object of consequence
 The passage from thence to Long Island is not often difficult, and its shores are, in many places, suited to the landing of troops, partic- ularly along the bay side from New "Utrecht by Gravesend, Flat Lands, and Jamaic Bay, when the wind is at or betwixt the North and West
 The army being once established upon Long Island, the investment of the enemy's works at Brooklyn and their reduction follows, of course, if they do not previously give you battle; which, from whatever quarter the operations proceed, I am persuaded they will endeavor to do
 But this is one reason why I would prefer throwing the army, or at least the greater part of it, over from Staten Island to Long Island, as that country does not present many advantages to the enemy, and you may possess yourself of the most favorable position, which is the high ground from Flat Bush, across towards the East River by Bed ford, before them
 If they give vou battle there, and are worsted, the reduction of all river posts is for- warded, and I believe the city may be very much annoyed during the operations against Brooklyn—the works there once carried, it is no longer tenable
 Another reason why I would prefer operating
Page 519

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 519 upon Long Island is, that there is not so great a probability of a vigorous resistance at the entering upon it as upon York Island, for there are so many landing places that the enemy may be held in great doubt about those you mean to make use of
 Supposing that they have discovered your general design, the country is by no means so favorable to them as York Island; and in order to prevent them from opposing it with their whole force, a body of eight or ten thousand men may be moved towards Morrisiaua, which will oblige them to keep a force in that quarter sufficient, at least, to resist any undertaking they may suppose them equal to; or leave open the principal passage to York Island
 These, together with the garri- sons of Brooklyn and Paulus Hook, which can not be less than five or six thousand, will so much reduce them as to give little proba- bility of success to an attempt upon your' main body acting on Long Island
 Besides, if boats are collected in the East River, which, were it only to amuse the enemy there, must be done, any part of that force at Morrisiana may occasionally be thrown over to Long Island
 At any rate, a detachment of the army sufficient to restrain their foragers must be somewhere in that quarter
 But suppose the pwt at Brooklyn carried, possession is still to be obtained of York Island, but it will then be easier as they must, of necessitv, abandon the city, and we shall have the command of the shores of both rivers
 It is not at all improbable that in the course of our opera- tions the city of New York will be destroyed; indeed, I have very little doubt that it would be the most speedy manner of reducing them, as the greatest part of their magazines must go with it, and it may be worthy consideration, even if it should not be aimed at
 They will probably retire to the high grounds in front of Mr
 Wall's house, where an exceeding strong camp may be formed; and there wait in hopes of relief till the most irresistible of all assail- ants, famine, humbles their pride and obliges them to sue for terms
 These are my general ideas about the attack on New York, upon the supposition that every necessary ship is taken to preserve the command by water—but it is very easy to take towns upon paper
 Should there be any probability that the command of the water may be lost, the army should by no means be ventured upon Long Island
1 Some frigates should be in the Sound

 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, A\tgust 1, 1780
 Dear Sir:—You will perceive, by the orders of this day, that the corps of light infantry is immediately to be formed
 The command of it, for the campaign, is promised to the Marquis de Lafayette, to Count De Rochambeau, and Chevalier De Ternay
 The most important paragraphs are the following: 1
 In any operation, and under all circumstances, a decisive naval superi- ority is to be considered as a fundamental principle, and the basis upon which every hope of success must ultimately depend
 2
 The advantages of possessing the post of New York, by the squadron of France, have been already enumerated to Count De Rochambeau and Chevalier De Ternay, and are so obvious as not to need recapitulation
 A delay in the execution of this enterprise may defeat all our projects, and render the campaign inactive and inglorious
 3
 To render our operations nervous and rapid, it is essential for us to bo masters of the navigation of the North River, and of the Sound
 Without this, our land transportation will be great, our expenses enormous, and our progress slow, if not precarious, for want of forage and other means
 4
 With these ideas, and upon this ground, it is conceived that many ad- vantages will result from the French squadron's taking possession of the inner harbor between Staten Island and the City of New York, and detach- ing a frigate or two above the chevaux-de-frise in the North River, opposite to Fort Washington, for the purpose of opening the navigation of the river, shortening tho transportation by land on the upper and lower communica- tion, and bringing the enemy to an explanation respecting Staten Island
 Shipping so near the town would, at the same time they cover the frigates in the North River, keep the garrison in check, and be more likely to facili- tate other movements of the army, than if they were to remain at the Hook or below the Narrows
 5
 Our operations against the enemy in the City of New York, may com- mence from either of three points, to-wit: Morrisiana, or the height near King's Bridge, or Staten Island
 Each has its advantages and disadvan- tages, but under a full view of all circumstances, the preponderancy is in favor of Morrisiana; especially since the aid of his Most Christian Majesty has come by the way of Rhode Island, instead of Cape Henry, as it was ex- pected they would do, and touch at Sandy Hook, in consequence of advices lodged there
 6
 As the means for carrying on our operations are not yet sufficiently ap- preciated, nor is the time by which our aids will arrive sufficiently ascer- tained, it is impossible to be precise as to the time the American troops can with safety rendezvous at Morrisiana; but, as it is necessary to fix some epoch, it is hoped that it may happen by the 5th of August
 I would pro- pose that day for the re-embarkation of the French efficient force at New Jjondon (if they should have come there), and that they proceed up the
Page 521

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 521 for reasons which, I dare say, will be to you obvious and satisfac- tory
 If we attack New York, the part which this corps will take will make it a most desirable command
 Should it be agreeable to you to take it until the return of this gentleman, which is uncer- tain, it would give me great pleasure
 I wish you, however, to consult your delicacy, and determine without the least restraint
 I want your answer
1 Sound to "VYhitestone, on Long Island, or to such other place on that island, or on tho main, as circumstances may require, and the Count shall be ad- visea of
 For, the operations against the enemy depending very much upon their holding all or dismantling some of their present posts, and upon con- tingencies on our side, it is not possible, at this time, to work out a precise plan, or determine whether our approaches to the City of New York shall be by way of York Island, Brooklyn, or both
 Numbers must determine the latter, and circumstances of the moment the former
 7
 It must be clearly understood and agreed between the parties, that, if any capital operation is undertaken, the French fleet and land forces will, at all events, continue their aid until the success of the enterprise, or until it is mutually determined to abandon it
 GEORGE WASHINGTON
 1The answer has not been found
 StSt. Clair, however, says in his narra- tive, that he joyfully accepted the command, grateful for this mark of tho high consideration for him manifested in this act by the Commander-in- Chief, but the sudden return of Sir Henry Clinton to New York put an end to the proposed movement, and the light infantry did not have an opportu- ity to take part in active movements
 This corps, says Sparks, "consisted of six battalions, each composed of eight companies, selected from the dif- ferent lines of the army
 These battalions were arranged in two brigades, one of which was commanded by General Hand, and the other by General Poor
1 The light infantry were stationed in advance of the main army
" Referring to this projected movement against the British at New York (which must not be confounded with the plan concerted with the French), in which StSt. Clair was to have the post of honor, I find this explanation by Washington, in a letter to the Marquis de Lafayette: "Though I previously intended to attack New York, if Clinton had gone to Rhode Island, yet I did not send for you, because I thought it not improbable he would return in consequence of our movement, as has happened, and because your pres- ence where you are, in the other case, would have been of great utility to the French fleet and army; but above all, because I was of opinion that it would be impracticable for you to arrive in time, as I intended to operate with the utmost celerity
" (1) General Poor died on the 9th September
 He had been In continuous service from the beginning of the war, and, by intelhgent action aml devoted patriotism, had reflected the highest honor on his State (New Hampshire)
 Hu was a brigadier under StSt. Clair, and in the battle of Bemis's Heights, was very efficient
 Washington and StSt. Clair held him in high esteem

 PRESIDENT REED TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 BLOOMSBURY, NEAR TRENTON, August 26, 1780
 Sir:—Your favor of the 19th inst
1 was delivered to me at this place yesterday
 I shall forward Major Church's list of promotions to the Council, in order to obtain their commissions
 As there is no certain account of Colonel Connor, I think it would be prema- ture to make an appointment in his place; for, though his country has not had the benefit of his service for some time, he ever bore- the character of a worthy, deserving officer, and, the disorder with which he was afflicted having been contracted in the public service, justice, as well as gratitude, will entitle him to much consideration
 Should he be alive, his feelings would be much wounded, and it "would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rectify the error
 Under these considerations, therefore, I believe you will agree with me that it is best to postpone it till we have more satisfactory accounts
 Colonel Harmer's merit is universally acknowledged, and I would gladly do any thing to promote his interests consistent with my duty, but I am sure he would not desire it at the expense of an un- fortunate, brave brother officer
 
 
 
 General McDougall showed me the petition, or remonstrance, of the general officers to Congress
 As several of the particulars, such as half pay for life, peusious for widows and orphans, comfortable and decent clothing, etc
, have been provided by Pennsylvania for its troops, unsolicited, and that upon a plan which was supposed to be highly satisfactory, I was somewhat surprised to see it had been signed in so unqualified a manner; unless the provision of the State was in time, quantity, or other circumstance, unacceptable, I think it would have been best to have discriminated, for many members of Congress now think that the troops of all States are in the same unprovided condition
 I was always of opinion that the provision for the federal army should have been on a general scale; but, ex- perience having shown a fatal defect in their arrangements, necessity, not policy, led me to promote a partial supply, and to make it hon- orable and effectual
 But, if it is really the sense and desire of the officers to lay aside their State provisions, and return to an immedi- ate dependence on Congress as the supreme governing power of America, I am sure there is not a person or public character in Pennsylvania that will give it the least obstruction
 It is certainly the true line of Government, and, I am sure, if duly and regularly 1 Not found

 lived up to, will render the army more effectual and independent of partial systems, local or personal prejndices
 As this memorial was signed only by the general officers, you will easily have opportuni- ties to know their sentiments on this point
1 We have sent to Europe for a complete supply of clothing for both officers and men, and, unless the accidents of the sea should disappoint or delay us, we shall, in a few days, send to Boston to secure some part of the great capture lately made there; but if a general plan of provision under the direction of Congress is likely to take place, we can transfer to the Continent what purchases we have made
 But I should not choose to do this till there was a per- fect understanding of acquiescence of all parties interested
 
 
 
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 CAMP AT TAPPAN, Sept
 5th, 1780
 It is certainly good policy to give the soldiery an interest in the issue of the contest, which, by making them public creditors, you do
 And I believe it would be a means, if not of preventing it altogether, of rendering desertion much less frequent than it has been
 The Eastern States had done this previous to the recom- mendation of Congress, and their troops are now in possession of Government security, payable at four different terms, and bearing interest
 I hope the Middle States (and Pennsylvania in particu- lar), which have always got the start of their eastern brothers in matters of generosity, will not be behind-hand with them in matters of justice
 The enemy seem to confine themselves to the defensive
 We lately foraged the country about Bergen in a very insulting man- ner, and with such a disposition of our troops that, if they had offensive designs, must have been a very great temptation, though, to he sure, the passage of the North River is not an easy operation
 I wish their seeming listlessness may not proceed from too perfect a knowledge of our situation
 We are starving, and, unless something very efficacious for the 1Colonel Walter Stewart to General StSt. Clair, Philadelphia, January 3 1782: "Exertions have been and still are making in Congress to constitute us an army belonging to the United States, and leaving entirely out the idea of State troops

 supply of the army is done very speedily, we must disband or turn freebooters—an evil of almost as much magnitnde as the first
1 You have much influence with members of Congress
 I entreat you to make them sensible of the risk to which they are exposing their country, and of the double risk to which they expose them- selves, for it begins to be a prevailing sentiment, both in the army and in the country, that a party amongst them have been bribed to drive things into confusion
 When the resentment of a people is aroused their revenge does not always extend to the guilty only
 1"At this very juncture I am reduced to the painful alternative, either of dismissing a part of the militia now assembling (though, by the way, they were to have rendezvoused the 25th of last month), or let them come forward to starve, which it will be extremely difficult for the troops already in the field to avoid
 
 
 
 Every day's experience proves more and more that the present mode of obtaining supplies is the most uncertain, expensive, and in- jurious that could bo devised
 It is impossible for us to form any caleula- tions of what we are to expect, and, consequently, to concert any plans for future execution
 
 
 
 "I can not forbear recurring in this place to the necessity of a more ample and equal provision for the army
 The discontents on this head have been gradually matured to a dangerous extremity
 There are many symptoms that alarm and distress mo
 Endeavors are using to unite both officers and men in a general refusal of the money, and some corps now actually decline receiving it
 Every method has been taken to counteract it, because such a combination in the army would be a severe blow to our declining currency
 The most moderate insist that the accounts of depreciation ought to be liquidated at stated periods, and certificates given by Government for sums due
 They will not be satisfied with a general declaration that it shall be made good
 "This is one instance of complaint
 There are others equally serious
 Among the most serious, is the inequality of the provision made by the sev- eral States
 Pennsylvania maintains her officers in a decent manner; she has given them half-pay for life
 What a wide difference between their sit- uation and that of the officers of every other line in this army, some of whom are actually so destitute of clothing, as to be unfit for duty, and are, for that cause, only obliged to confine themselves to quarters
 I have often said, and beg leave to repeat it, that the half-pay provision is, in my opinion, the most politic and effectual that could be adopted
 On the whole, if some- thing satisfactory be not done, the army (already so much reduced in officers by resignations, as not to have a sufficiency to do the common duties of it), must either cease to exist at the end of the campaign, or it will exhibit an example of more virtue, fortitude, self-denial, and perseverance, than has ^perhaps ever yet been paralleled in the history of human enthusiasm

 525 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 CAMP, September 9, 1780
 The attack on New York always appeared to me a very hazard- ous and doubtful enterprise
1 I think it now out of the question al- together, on account of the advanced season; our scant force; the precariousness of our supplies, and the want of a sufficient naval force, in which a decided superiority is necessary to give the under- taking the least probability of success
 If the Second Division of the French Fleet should arrive soon, and that naval superiority be obtained, it would require some time, as well as bringing forward the apparatus and stores for a siege, and I should still hesitate about the propriety of commencing operations against that place
 We could not, probably, reckon on more than two months to keep the field
 Winter would be upon us, and, with the force the enemy have there, it is not unreasonable to suppose that they could suc- cessfully contest the ground with us for that space
 I should hesi- tate, still more, because, though there have been instances of sieges carried on in winter, there is an uncertainty of a constant and regu- lar supply of provisions, and a failure in that would us certainly 1 From this letter, it will bo seen that the opinion had been reached that, owing to the non-arrival of the Second Division of the French Fleet and troops, ns expected, it would be a desperate undertaking now to attack the British at New York
 The fleet, under the Chevalier de Ternay, was in- ferior to that of the British under Admiral Arbuthnot, and, lor this reason, although a plan for a joint attack was formed with the present force, and communicated to Count de Roehambeau, that officer refused to approve of it
 He held that, unless he should be reinforced by the Second Division of French troops, or succors should arrive from the West Indies, where the Count de Guichen was engaged, or Sir Henry Clinton should detach a part of his force to the southward, it would be wiser to act on the defensive
 Washington approved of this, although greatly disappointed in the inaction of the cam- paign
 His anxiety was great, as, without money and without provisions, it was impossible for him to keep an army in the field
 "The Commander feared," said the Count de Roehambeau, "and not without foundation, con- sidering the absolute discredit of the finances of Congress, that the struggles of this campaign would be the last efforts of expiring patriotism
 He wished, at any hazard, to risk an attack upon the enemy in the stronghold, while he had tho French troops at his disposal
" The Chevalier de Tor- nay decided to make his station in Boston Harbor, and Washington gave orders for his troops to recross the river, and proceed to Dobbs's Ferry, about ten miles from King's Bridge, where he intended to establish a more eligi- ble communication, in case New York should prove to be the eventual object of the Americans

526 The StSt. Clair Papers
 subject us to a miscarriage, as if the enemy defeated us; it is, in- deed, the most disgraceful of the two, because it might be foreseen
 The season is too far advanced for an attempt on Canada also
 From the misfortunes to the southward,1 North Carolina is in dan- ger of being entirely overrun; nor are the frontiers of Virginia in perfect safety
 The troops proposed to be raised in that country and Maryland may not be completed in time to check the torrent, and, when completed, no great dependence can be put upon them for some time, as the greatest part of them will be raw, and the whole undisciplined
 It will, therefore, it appears to me, be necessary to make a detachment from this army to that country, which, with the others, may form an army of observation, and keep Lord Cornwallis in check
 The new troops will acquire discipline from the example of the others, and from being, probably, frequently engaged in small parties with the enemy, and the whole brought to such a state as to be fit for offensive operations as occasion may require
 That occa- sion will probably happen soon, for if the Second Division of the French Fleet arrives this fall, it will be at the time most proper for acting in South Carolina
 If then the superiority at sea is cer
 tain, I would propose to embark the French troops, and send them to Charleston
 This would oblige Lord Cornwallis to fall back, the army of observation would enter the country at his heels, oblige the inhabitants to return to their allegiance to the States as they pro- ceeded, intercept his convoys, harass him in his march, cut off his communication with the country, and, finally, by a junction or co- operation with the French, facilitate and secure the reduction of Charleston
 All this might be done in the course of this winter, and the greater part of the troops employed in it rejoin the main army before the opening of the next campaign
 But this is all upon the supposition that provisions and all other things necessary are to be had in that country, and that proper means have been used to procure them—without these, men are useless anywhere
 If there is still a prospect of acting against New York, the detachment I have proposed can not be made, nor, indeed, can it be a very large one, in any case, for though at present the prosi>ect of offensive operations being over, a considerable one might possibly be spared, attention must be paid to what our force will be in January next
 Another consideration should have some weight, viz
, that Sir Henry Clinton may very probably expect that we will detach from this 1This was the defeat of the army under General Gates on the 16th Au- gust, about eight miles from Camden

1 This is the best opinion I have been able to form on the several matters your Excellency was pleased to lay before the Council
 To THE OFFICER COMMANDING AT WEST POINT
 ROBINSON HOUSE, September 27, 1780
 Sir:—You will immediately make a distribution of the troops under your command to the several posts, that the whole may be in a state of defense at the shortest notice
 You will also have each work supplied with ten days' provisions, wood, water and stores, and keep up constantly that supply; and you will take every other pre- caution for the security of the post
 The enemy will have acquired, from General Arnold, a perfect knowledge of the defenses, and will be able to take their measures with the utmost precision
 This makes it essential that our vigilance and care should be redoubled for its preservation
 Yon will do every thing in vour power to gain information of the enemy's designs, and give me intelligence, as early as pissible, of any movement against you
 A party of militia, who have been emploved cutting wood, and another as guards to the stores at Fishkill, that have been called in, are to return to their destinations
 Colonel Gouvion will remain a few days at this post, to assist in the necessary arrangements
 I am, etc

 Note
 For several months, beginning while he was in command at Philadelphia, Benedict Arnold had been carrying on a secret correpondence with the British commander at New York
 After he obtained the command at West Point, his treasonable purposes were brought to a sudden issue
 On the 20th of September, John Andre, Adjutant-General of the British army, went on board the sloop of war Vulture, and proceeded up the Hudson, with a view of holding nn interview with Arnold
 On the night of the 21st, a boat was sent by Arnold to the Vulture, which brought Andre• to the shore, about six miles below Stony Point, "and there, under the shadow of the mountains, after midnight, the conspirators met
" Thence they proceeded to the house of Joshua Hett Smith, within two miles of Stony Point, where they break- fasted and completed arrangements for the surrender of West Point
 Plans of the works, their armament, the number of troops, etc
, were furnished to Andre•, and concealed by him between his stockings and his feet
 As the Vulture had been fired on by the Americans, she dropped down the river, and this necessitated Andre's remaining concealed at Smith's house all day
 Arnold furnished him with a pass, under the name of John Anderson, which was to be used with the guards
 Smith refused to put him on board the Vulture, hut agreed to escort him beyond the American lines
 They started in the evening, crossing the river at King's Ferry
 They traveled eight miles, and wore stopped by an American patrol, who accepted the pass, but advised them not to proceed farther that night
 The next morning they started again, and when the nentral ground was reached, Smith returned to the river, and Andre continued his journey
 He had exchanged his uniform for plain clothes, and now regarded all danger as past
 Hence, when he was stopped soon after by three men, one of whom was dressed in British uni- form, Andre's caution deserted him, and he imprudently exclaimed, "Gen- tlemen, I hope you belong to our party
" "What party?" was asked
 "The lower party," said Andre
 "Wo do," said the other
 Thereupon, Andre• declared himself to be a British officer, and told them not to detain him, as he was on important business
 The three men—John Paulding, Isaac Van Wert and David Williams—then informed him ho was their prisoner
 No offers of compensation could swerve them, and Andre' had met his doom
 From Colonel Sheldon's headquarters, Andre• sent a letter to General Wash- ington (September 24th), informing him of his real name and position, but denying being a spy
 On the morning of the 25th, Arnold, whose headquarters were at the Robinson House, was startled by receiving a message from Washington, an- nouncing that he would breakfast with him
 While Washington stopped to 1See note l,p

 529 command of that post, with its dependencies, till further orders
 The troops under" your command will consist of the Pennsylvania division, Colonels Meigs' and Livingston's regiments of Continental troops, and a body of Massachusetts and New Hampshire militia
 The inclosed is a copy of the instructions left for the commanding officer, which you will please to observe
 Unless you should think it necessary, for the immediate security of the post, to draw the First Pennsylvania Brigade nearer to West Point, I should wish it to remain somewhere in its present position, as it may then, at the same time, serve the purpose of reinforcing the main armv in case of a movement against it
 But, on the first appearance of the enemy coming in force up the river, that brigade should have pre- vious orders to march to your succor
 Orders have been given, in the case last mentioned, for the posts inspect some posts, Lafayette and Hamilton rode forward to the Robinson House, where they arrived as Mr
 and Mrs
 Arnold were about to sit down to breakfast
 They were invited to join the family, which they did
 I'retty soon, an officer arrived with a letter to Arnold, which contained the infor- mation that Andre had boon captured
 Arnold saw that all would soon be discovered to Washington
 Excusing himself, he withdrew and proceeded to make preparations for flight
 Beforc leaving, he confided his secret to his wife
 Some hours passed after Washington's arrival before the terrible facts became known to him
 He then took instant steps for defeating the plot
 Ho caused the arrest of Hett Smith, and secured Arnold's staff-officers, who, however, were ignorant of all proceedings
 On the 26th, Washington wrote to the President of Congress, and on the 27th, issued the above order
 For the best accounts of the treason of Arnold, the reader is referred to "The Life of Benedict Arnold,'' by Isaac N
 Arnold; and to Irving's Life of Washington
 1At the time the above order was received, General StSt. Clair was quite ill with fever
 He, however, immediately responded, and found no more leisure time for sickness
 Before arriving at West Point, he dispatched the follow- ing brief letter to Mrs
 StSt. Clair: Dear Madam:—I had intended to write you a long letter, but am so much hurried that I can only tell you that 1 am now pretty well recovered—per- fectly of my fever, but have not quite got my strength again; the fine season coming on will bring that with it
 General Arnold's desertion has been the cause of my going to take the command of the posts where he was, from whence you shall hear from me very soon
 I will send a man to you with such necessaries as you want and I can procure, and for farther particulars must refer you to business letters
 I was very much pleased with one I had lately from John Murray,1 as well with the matter of it as with the writing, which was better than I expected

 I long much to see you all

 of Verplanck's and Stony Point to be evacuated, with all the can- non and stores, and the garrison added to that at West Point
 But I would not wish this step to be precipitated; as, in case of an at- tempt to surprise you, these posts will not only be useful to give you the alarm, but they will probably, in all cases, gain you time, as the the enemy would hardly venture to pass them with the transports full of troops
 The baggage and extra stores may be sent off at the first aspect of a serious movement; but the troops should not evacuate until the enemy are in a situation to invest the posts
 Dobbs's Ferry may also serve you as an outpost; but care must be taken to distinguish the firing against a single vessel passing from that against a number, which will, of course, be more continued
 Great vigilance should be used in patroling on the east side of the river, as it would otherwise be easy for the enemy to land a body of men below, and surprise Verplanck's Point
 I must entreat your particular care of the boats on the river; to keep them in repair, and, as much as possible, collected
 All those at King's Ferry— more than are wanted for the necessary service of the communica- tion—should be moved up the North River
 A part of the militia at Verplanck's and Stony Point may also be drawn to the main garrison

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 WEST POINT, 7th October, 1780
 Sir:—I received your Excellency's letter of yesterday, and am very glad that you have ordered up the troops which are to compose the garrison, as it is very necessary they should be here, that things may be got into some kind of order before the winter
 At present they are very much deranged
 The laying in a proper stock of firewood is a very heavy but a very essential business, and the militia which have been employed in cutting it, I am told, have done little more than supply the post at Fishkill, and are very little ahead
 I expect a report of the quantity to-day from Colonel Hughes, to whom I have recommended to allot them a mod- erate task per day, as the best means to make them most useful
 The magazine of provisions is very nearly exhausted; thirty bar- rels, only, of salted meat on hand, exclusive of what is in the works (about five days' for the troops posted in them), and no cattle, and the men have been, some days, reduced to three-quarters of a pound of flour
 I expect, however, two hundred barrels of that article to-day, and have written to Colouel Hay (to be laid before the Leg- islature of this State), very pressingly, to have an immediate and ample supply of provisions thrown in, as it may not be possible to do it some time hence, from the state the river is frequently in, about the beginning of winter
 I directed Colonel Livingston1 to collect and send up here all the boats that were not necessary below; provided they had not been ordered there by your Excellency for some particular purpose
 His answer is, that they were ordered there for transporting the cannon, in case it became necessary to evacuate the posts he commands
 They will, therefore, remain there, unless I have your directions to the contrary; but, I must beg leave to suggest to your Excellency that, after the intention of the enemy becomes apparent with respect to but to no purpose
 West Point he must have
 This display of selfishness does not make us forget the merit of the man
 General Greene remained at West Point from the 9th to the 16th of Octo- ber, when he was relieved by General Heath
 He was appointed to the command in South Carolina
 1 Colonel Livingston commanded at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point

 them, it will most probably be too late to evacuate them with any probability of saving the cannon and stores
 If they be evacuated before their intention is discovered, it will be in their power to oc- cupy them, after they may have failed in an attempt upon this place
 I find some heavy brass field artillery here, which is not, I suppose, intended for garrison use, and had better be removed
 Some repairs have been making upon the carriages, but that might as well be done anywhere else
 The Pennsylvania Brigade shall march as soon as the other troops arrive
 The times of the militia begin to expire on the 14th, and will be all expired on the 24th
 I have not heard from Major Tallmadge, nor have any accounts from New York by any other way
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT HEED
 TRENTON, January 4lh, 1781
 Sir:—The Marquis and myself, with several other officers, ar- rived at this place about 3 o'clock
 The mutineers, consisting nearly of the whole Pennsylvania line and the regiment of artillery, are at Princeton, where they arrived last night, and this day has been spent in negotiating betwixt them and General Wayne, Colonel Richard Butler, and Colonel Stewart; and I have the honor to in- close you a copy of the terms proposed by them, with General Wayne's answer
 These are the only officers they allow to have any communication with them, or to pass within their posts, which are, I am told, well ehpsen, and the guards very regularly mounted; and a committee of sergeants manages their business
 You will see how extravagant their proposals arc, and General Wayne has gone as far as he well could do in compliance with them
 They have, as yet, done very little injury to the inhabitants, and profess that they do not mean any; but they begin to talk of their neighborhood to New York, which makes it justly feared that there are amongst them some emissaries of the enemy
 This circumstance induces Governor Livingston to think that it would be prudent, in case they persist, to suffer them to pass the Delaware, as it would then be out of their power to go to the enemy; and, if force should be nec- essary, a part of the militia of this State might be thrown over to co-operate with those of Pennsylvania in their reduction
 No defini- tive resolution is, however, token upon that head; but it is neces- sary your Excellency should be apprised that it is in contemplation, that the proper measures may be concerted, in case of necessity

day to expostulate with them, but were not permitted
 An express is this moment arrived, that they have refused General Wayne's terms, and propose to march to-morrow
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 MORRISTOTVN, 7th January, 1781
 Sir:—Your Excellency has heard of the shameful defection of the Pennsylvania line; and I am very much concerned to inform you that, as yet, there is no prospect, as we know of, of any desire appearing in them to return to their duty
 I happened to be in Philadelphia the day the accounts of it arrived there, and set out earlv next morning, in company with the Marquis do Lafayette, to make trial of what influence we might have; but, though we were suffered to come into Princeton, and there was an appearance of satisfaction in the countenances of the troops, we were not allowed to have auv communication with them
 A committee of sergeants, J who are doubtless at the bottom of the whole, have got the business into their own hands, and no person is allowed to speak to the sol- dierv but through them
 Their demands are no less than an almost total dissolution of the line
 They are, to the best of my recollection, the discharge of all those who have been enlisted in the years 1777 and '78, and who received the bounty of twenty and one hundred and twenty dollars; immediate payment of their arrears and depreciation; and a general indemnity
 General Wayne, in answer to these demands, made revolt of the Pennsylvania line took place at nine o'clock, on the night of tho first of January
 A few refused to join, but n groat propor- tion, including the artillerists, formed und marched toward Philadelphia
 A few subordinate officers resisted, and were roughly handled
 Captains Billings and Talbot lost their lives
 The demand of the troops was for an immediate discharge
 They moved under tho direction of a board of ser- geants
 The regiments were under the immediate command of General Wayne
 That officer, and Colonels Butler and Stewart, continued with the 
men

534 The StSt. Clair Papers
 them such promises as ought to have satisfied reasonable men, look- ing only for redress of grievances, whether real or imaginary, but they were rejected; so that I have no doubt but emissaries from the enemy are amongst them, and believe that nothing but force will reduce them to reason
 Unhappily, however, there seems to be no disposition in the militia of this State to come to that method; and it was the opinion of the Governor and such members of the Legis- lature as we saw at Trenton, that they should be suffered to pass the Delaware
 This I informed Governor Reed of, from that place, that he might have time to take the proper measures; but they seem disposed to keep post at Princeton
 Whilst we were at the last place, Colonel Laurens came up, and we very soon after re- ceived a notice that our being in town was very disagreeable, and desiring us, for our own safety, to retire; and our stay was after- ward limited to an hour and a half
 As we had no prospect of be- ing of service, we set off, lest they should think of detaining us
 We have since heard that they have made General Wayne, Colonels Butler and Stewart, prisoners; but the most alarming circumstance is, their having organized themselves, and appointed all the neces- sary officers
 There are still a few men at the huts, to whom I have sent this morning, with an assurance that they will be considered principally in whatever may be done for the line at large, and have directed that they may be collected and marched to Persipenny, to render their communication with the revolters more difficult; and have given directions for removing the remaining artillery and ammuni- tion to Suckysunuy
 We were unfortunate to miss Major Fishbourn, and have no knowledge of your Excellency's intentions
 I thought it probable that you might have come clown to this place
 If that is not your design, I beg I may be favored with your Excellency's instructions
 P
 S
—I have not learned that any movements of the enemy in- dicate an intention to enter Jersey, yet I can not persuade myself that they will not endeavor to avail themselves of this disaster, though, perhaps, they may defer it until it is certain that force is necessary
 After Major Fishbourn's departure from Princeton, from a desire expressed by the committee to confer with some of the Council of Pennsylvania, General Wayne sent an express to Philadelphia, re- questing some of that body to meet them
 They were expected to- arrive yesterday

 He will certainly be very desirous to meet you and the other gentlemen who have been with the troops, to hear your report, and have you convey to them his comments
 They must be convinced, from the knowledge they have of his character and his friendship for the soldiers, that every redress of real grievances within his power will be granted to them
 I would wish you to meet them as soon as possible, that an end may be put to this unhappy business

 Dear Sir:—This will be brought to you by a person who has been sent by Sir Henry Clinton with proposals to the discontented troops, and was honest enough to bring them to me
 In order that we might be certain of their intentions with respect to the enemy, we have thought it best to suffer him to go on with a message, and he in to return here with the answer
 We have heard that they have already detained two who came to them on the same errand
 If this person should meet with the same fortune, you will be pleased to have him discharged, if in your power
 I am extremely anxious to hear how matters are going on, and what prospect there is of the affairs being terminated
 I beg my respects to Colonel Butler and Colonel Stewart, and hope soon to have the happiness to see you in more agreeable situations

 town, have both reached me in the course of this day
 I can not cuuceive how Major Fishbourn could have misunderstood me as to my intention of going down
 The postscript of my letter of the 3d to General Wayne,1 which was added after I had consulted Governor Clinton and the general officers, was to the contrary
 Upon re- ceiving your letter of the 7th, I sent directions to General Heath to assemble all the general officers, and officers commanding corps, at his quarters, to-morrow morning, where I shall meet them
 What I have to propose is of too delicate a nature to commit to paper; neither can I say, until I have had the meeting, whether it will be prndent for me to go down towards Morristown
 You shall hear from me after the meeting is over
 I think it appears, by the letter which has fallen into your hands, that there has not been much, if any, intercourse between the mutineers and Sir H
 Clinton; and, if the future correspondence can be intercepted, it will embarrass the British and the troops
 You will have been the best jndge of the kind of answer which it would be proper to give to Sir Henry's message; but, as we had not force sufficient to wish to decoy him out, perhaps it will have been most prndent to answer him in the
 negative
 1 am certain that, in consequence of my letter of the 8th to Gen- eral Wayne, every offer that could with propriety be made, has been made
2 What further is to be done can be better determined by you on the spot, than by me at this distance
 The steps you have hitherto taken are jndicious and strictly proper
 Be pleased to thank the Marquis and Colonel Laurens for their letters, which a press of business prevents me from answering
 If I do go down, it will be by Chester, Warwick, Colonel Sew- ard's, Davenport's Mill, and to Morristown
 You will send ex- presses on that route, but do not let it be known that I mean to take it

—Upon second thought, I am in doubt whether I shall comedown, because the mutineers musthuve returned to their duty, or the

 -537 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL ST
 CLAIB
 NEW WINDSOR, 12th January, 1781
 Dear Sir:—The receipt of your letter of the 9th,1 inclosing one from General Wayne, has, if possible, added to my embarrassments
 I had heard from General Sullivan and Lord Stirling, that the mu- tineers had delivered up the British emissaries immediately upon their arrival at Princeton
 From this I was in hopes that they had precluded themselves from all assistance from that quarter, and that the reduction of them by force, should matters come to extremities, would not be difficult
 But now, their conduct appears to me in this light: they have made known the propositions offered by Sir Henry Clinton only by the way of threat, and seem to say, if you do not grant our terms we can obtain them elsewhere
 At the meeting with the general and field officers yesterday, it was almost a unanimous opinion that their men might be depended upon
 I, therefore, gave directions for a detachment of one thou- sand men (this number should be exaggerated if spoken of), to be prepared and held in readiness
 • If things are in a train of nego- tiation, as would seem to be the case from General Wayne's post- script, to move a force between Trenton and the enemy might create suspicion in the minds of the mutineers and make them fly to the enemy for safety
 I do not think it prudent to write to the com- mittee of Congress, to Governor Reed, or to General Wayne, lest my letter should be stopped; I thmk, therefore, from a consideration of the subject in every light, that it will be best for you to go down to the Pennsylvania side, opposite to Trenton, and send for some of the gentlemen over there
 Inquire minutely into the situation of affairs, and if there are no hopes of a reasonable compromise, get from them an opinion of what ought ultimately to be done
 If force should be determined upon, the Governors of Pennsylvania and Jer- sey should instantly make arrangements for bringing out as many of their militia as can be collected, while the detachment above mentioned is marching from hence, that the intercourse between Trenton and this place may be as expeditious as possible
 Desire Colonel Nelson to fix a relay of expresses from the neighborhood tion of strength aguinst us; or should they bo dispersed, their loss to the service will be severely felt
 Both these evils are, therefore, to he avoided, if there is any proper ground on which it can be done

 Dear Sir:—I have duly received your favor of the llth,1 to- gether with one from the committee of Congress of the 9th inst
 As I had just dispatched an express to you with my letter of the 12th, I have detained your messenger until this time in expectation that something so decisive would have turned up as might have fixed the line of conduct which we ought to pursue
 But nothing new having come to my knowledge which could give sufficient ground for determination, since my last, I can only refer you to it
 The detachment shall be held in readiness till I hear from you, which I anxiously expect every moment
 Indeed, nothing can be of greater importance than to communicate with the utmost rapidity every incident that may happen during the continuance of this un- happy affair
2 1 The letter is missing from the StSt. Clair Papers
 2 When the news of the revolt reached Philadelphia, Congress appointed a committee, consisting of General Sullivan, Mr
 Witherspoon, and Mr
 Mathews, who were instructed to confer with President Reed on the sub- ject
 The Hitter proceeded to Princeton and the committee to Trenton
 Meanwhiln, the mutineers delivered up two emissaries sent by Sir Henry Clinton, which showed their attachment to the American cause
 These were tried by a court, consisting of Oenerals Wayne and Irvine, and Colonels Butler and Stewart, and Alnjor Fishbourn, condemned and executed on the llth: The following proposals were offered to the mutineers by the com- mittee and President Reed: "1
 To discharge sill those who had enlisted indefinitely for three years, or during the war; the fact to be inquired into by threo commissioners, to be appointed by the Executive, and to be ascertained, where the original en- listment could not be produced, by the oath of the soldier
 '•2
 To give immediate certificates for the depreciation on their pay, and to settle arrearages as soon as circumstances would admit
 "To furnish them immediately with certain specified articles of clothing, wbich were greatly wanted
" These terms, which General Sullivan assured Washington were such as the critical situation of affairs warranted and justice dictated, were ac- cepted on the further stipulation that three commissioners should be deputed by the line to act conjointly with the others in determining what soldiers

 539' GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW WINDSOR, 3d February, 1781
 Dear Sir:—The unexpected reduction of the Pennsylvania line1 from the late unfortunate affair, adds to the necessity of the greatest attention to improve the measures adopted for recruiting it
 I do not know precisely what these are, but I am informed, in general, that money is raising for the purpose, and that the recruiting serv- ice goes on with success
 In order to have it conducted with regu- larity and activity, I am to request you will undertake to super- should be discharged
 Thus the dispute, which had its origin the previous year, as mentioned in StSt. Clair's Correspondence, as to the real term of en- listment—for three years or for the war—was finally authoritatively settled
 It gave a great shock to the country, and filled the minds of the chief of- ficers with apprehensions for the future
 It is not at all likely matters would have come to this pass and the cause placed in such jeopardy, but for the insubordination of leading officers of the Pennsylvania line on the occasion of the appointment of Major McPherson to one of the regiments by Gen- eral Washington
 The chief offender on that occasion was General Wayne himself
 The example set by him then was not forgotten by the sergeants and the troops on the present occasion
 1 Under the arrangement entered into between the Congressional Com- mittee and the mutineers, advantage was taken and a majority of the men returned home
 This nearly destroyed StSt. Clair's division, and, as active operations would not bo undertaken until in May or June, an effort was to be made to restore the line
 The Pennsylvania Council notified StSt. Clair, on the 5th February, that the State was prepared to aid in the work, and requested him, through Secretary Matlock, to designate the places of rendezvous, and order the officers to repair to their stations
 It was an- nounced that, in order to meet traveling expenses, an additional sum of ten pounds to each officer and six pounds to each subaltern would be allowed, on account of depreciated money
 StSt. Clair invited General Washington to select the place of general rendezvous, with which he complied in the fol- lowing note: NEW WINDSOR, IZth Feb
, 1781
 Dear Sir

 In my opinion, Bristol and that neighborhood will be, upon many ac- counts, most suitable and convenient for this purpose
 It is on the most direct communication to the army, from whence the troops assembled may be drawn without loss of time, upon an emergency
 I would wish them to be cantoned as compact as possible, for the better preservation of discip- line, and on account of exercise and maneuver, both of which should be constantly practiced
 I hope to hear that the gout, of which you were apprehensive, has had its turn, and left you in good health
 I shall set out on Thursday for New- port, and shall probably be absent between a fortnight and three weeks

 intend it, and will make your arrangements with the State accord- ingly
 Inclosed you will find a copy of the instructions of the re- cruiting officers of the other parts of the army, which will also be proper for the Government of those of your State
 We have found, from experience, that, by some means or other, numbers of men are lost between the place of enlistment and that of rendezvous
 To prevent this, as far as possible, will be worthy your particular attention
 I have permitted General Wayne to retire for a while
 General Irvine will immediately assist you in the execution of this business
 It seems a great part of the soldiers of your line have fraudulently procured a discharge, by the precipitate admission of their oaths be- fore the papers relative to their enlistment could be produced
 In right, this can not exempt them from their engagements, and, after what has happened, if it were thought expedient to compel the re- turn of such as being explicitly engaged for the war, have thus per- jured themselves, I should have no doubt of its justice, and should not hesitate to take effectual and convenient measures to notify them that if they did not immediately return to their duty, they should be considered and treated as deserters
 I perceive there are objec- tions to the measure, and, unacquainted as I am with all the cir- cumstances, I can not competently judge of its propriety
 I, there- fore, shall be obliged to you for your opinion
1 Let me hear, from time to time, of your progress
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW WINDSOR, 22d February, 1781
 Dear Sir:—You will, by the time this reaches you, be acquainted with the destination of the detachment under the command of the Marquis de Lafayette,2 which, though as large as could possibly be afforded from the troops in this quarter, is not so competent to the certain completion of the object in view as I could wish
 By some accounts from Philadelphia, I am led to hope that further assistance 1 For a reply to this letter, see letter to Washington under date of 2d March
 2 General Lafayette was provided with a detachment of about twelve hun dred from the main army, and was instructed to proceed to Virginia to act ugainst the corps of the enemy under Arnold, in conjunction with the mili- tia, and some ships from the fleet of Chevalier Destouches, which had sailed for the James River or! the 9th February from Newport

 541 may be derived from the Pennsylvania line
 If you fmd it practi- cable to form a battalion of eight companies of fifty rank and file each, three officers to a company, and two field-officers to a bat- talion, in such time as the Marquis shall think will answer his pur- pose, you will be pleased to do it, and put it under his command
 The detachment will be but temporary
 The nomination of the field-officers I leave to you
 It is possible that the battalion may be formed, but not in time to embark at the Head of Elk with the other troops
 This will not be so material, provided it can be done in a short time afterwards
 That time, you and the Marquis will determine
 If the companies can not be completed to fifty each, I would have them at forty rather than lose the reinforcement, or even half a battalion of two hundred under the command of a field-officer, rather than none
 Transports can be provided and held ready at the Head of Elk, should they not embark with the other troops
 The places of rendezvous of the first, second, fifth, and sixth battalions are none of them very distant from Elk, and I should imagine the detachment would be most readily and conven- iently formed from them
 But this I leave to your jndgment
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW WINDSOR, 26th February, 1781
 Dear Sir:—Congress, by a resolve of the 20th instant, have deter- mined that the Pennsylvania line, except
 Moylan's dragoons, and the troops upon command to the westward, shall compose part of the Southern army, and have directed me to order it to join the army in Virginia by detachments, as they may be in readiness to march
 You will, therefore, in obedience to the above resolve, put matters in a proper train to carry it into execution with all dis- patch possible
 You will now, in case circumstances should permit the detachment under the command of the Marquis to proceed down the Chesapeake, not confine yourself to a single battalion of four hundred men, as mentioned in mine of the 22d, but endeavor to send as many as possible by so good and expeditious a conveyance
 I think it essential that one of the brigadiers should proceed to Virginia with the first detachment that moves, and there be ready to receive and form the remainder as they come on
 There may be greater necessity of an officer of rank being at hand, as the line, from the late disturbances in it, will have lost somewhat of its dis- cipline

 cruiting business, the duty devolves upon General Wayne
 I have written to him on the subject
 GENERAL ST
 CLAIK TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, March 2d, 1781
 Sir:—Your Excellency's letters of the 3d and 9th of February came duly to hand, but I delayed answering them from an expec- tation that you were absent from the army, and in case I had noth- ing explicit to inform you of with regard to the recruiting, that business not having come before the Assembly until yesterday, al- though General Irvine, General Wayne, and myself, have constantly attended to press them upon it
 A committee have reported a plan recommended by us, which is, in general, to call forth the number of men required by assessing them upon the classes of inhabitants under a very heavy penalty, and, at the same time, to carry on the recruiting by voluntary enlistments
 It is yet uncertain whether the House will come into it, but it is a favorable circumstance that it has met with the approbation of the Council
 It is certain that a great many of the soldiers obtained their dis- charges in a most flagitious manner, but nothing better was ex- pected from the alternative allowed them
 I am, however, of opin- ion that no good consequences would flow from the attempt to pun- ish them
1 It was threatened by some of the officers, and has driven a great many out of the State
 They are too numerous, and it would carry with it something like a breach of faith, which the Government does not like to incur, and, though the measure was certainly entered into hastily, it appeared to the gentlemen who transacted it to be necessary
 Your Excellency's favor of the 22d came by express to Potts Grove, the night before last, and I returned immediately to this place to confer with the Marquis
 You may imagine my chagrin at not being able to comply with so small a request upon such an occasion; but, after mature consideration it was thought imprudent to attempt it, as none of the men have yet been settled with, nor to this moment arc the auditors appointed for that purpose, nor any of the promises that were made them at Trenton complied with, and a very few only of the furloughed men returned
 Our number at all the different places of rendezvous does not exceed five hundred, and 1See Washington's letter to StSt. Clair, 3d February ante

 543 those extremely discontented
 I shall again press the Council and Assembly to an immediate settlement of the accounts, and order tn« men on furloughs to join their regiments that your Excellency's or- ders of the 26th, which I have just received, may be carried into exe- cution as soon as possible
 But I fear few or none can be got ready in time to second the Marquis, as it is indispensable that they be clothed and settled with, and that provisions be provided for them' on their march
 I can only promise that nothing on my part shall be wanting to expedite it
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO THE BOARD OF WAR
 PHILADELPHIA, March 4tfi, 1781
 Gentlemen:—As the troops of Pennsylvania are ordered to march to Virginia by detachments as soon as they can be got in readiness, it will be necessary that camp equipage be provided for them, and sent forward to Yorktown as soon as possible; but, as it will be some time before the whole quota of the State can be raised, and I am not certain what that will amount to, I have to request that tents, knapsacks, haversacks, camp-kettles, and blankets and can- teens, be got ready for two thousand men and sent to that place as soon as may be, having hopes that in a fortmght a considerable part of that number will be able to move
 I shall take care to give timely notice to the quartermaster if further provisions be nec- essary
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO THE SPEAKER l OF HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY
 PHILADELPHIA, March 22, 1781
 Sir:—I beg leave to lay before you an extract from a letter of General Irvine to me, dated Carlisle, March 14, 1781, which came to hand yesterday:— "I think there is great defect in the mode of communicating the laws or resolves
 I mean by newspapers
 Some counties never hear of a single Act till the county member gets home—as a proof, the commissioners of this county are only now making out the class rolls for the first class
 The regimental returns will show how slow things go on
 I do not think we shall be able to take the field much before the first of June

 The StSt. Clair Papers, '
 The law the General refers to, is that passed last session for com- pleting the quota of the Federal army, which will he found to he, if my information is right, in every other part of the State, as well as Cumberland county, totally inadequate to that purpose
 I mention this to show the necessity of immediately adopting some other ef- fectual measure for speedily raising and completing the quota of this State, and as they are to compose part of the Southern army, the fate of that country may depend upon the exertions of this
 It is likewise very necessary that means be fallen upon to pay off the arrears due to the soldiers, as I have it in command from General Washington to send them forward hy detachments as soon as p>ssi- hle, and the sending troops to that country in a discontented mood may he attended with consequences of a most disagreeable nature
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO PRESIDENT REED
 April 3, 1781
 Sir:—I beg leave to acquaint you that I have received infor- mation from several cantonments of great uneasiness prevailing among tbc soldiery, occasioned by the detention of their bounties and the non-payment of the gratuitv to the re-enlisted soldiers
1 It has been represented to me, that unless they are soon made easy on these heads, it is likely to end in general desertion
 I hope I may not be thought importunate, as I know' the difficulties that exist re- specting money, and am sure that the Council are as anxious to remove them as I could wish, but I should be wanting in my duty if I neglected to communicate to them such information as I receive
 I must mention, also, the case of Colonel Moylan's regiment
 The General expects it to march with the detachment; they have not more than fifty horses fit for service, and are in want of every kind of equipment
 Tbe time of the furloughs granted at Trenton is now expired
 I shall call upon all those to whom they have been granted, immediately to join their regiments under pain of being considered as deserters; but the more effectually to enforce their re- 1 To this, President Reed replied from his residence on the S'ime day: "I have just received your favor, which is a melancholy confirmation of the accounts received from the commissioners for recruiting, who repre- sent that they can get no money from the county treasurers, nor can the cbmmissioners of purchase get any to feed the troops, so that I fenr wo shall, in a short time, experience some disagreeable effects
 The treasury here is exhausted by the various demands, so that Mr

 Henhoren can not make out money sufficient to pay the members of Assembly their wages

 545 turn, I could wish the magistrates in the different districts were directed to make strict inquiry into the cases of all persons within their districts who arc or have been soldiers, and to commit such as may be found with furloughs when the time has expired
 I could also wish that some printer in this city was directed to receive ad- vertisements for deserters
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, April 6, 1781
 Sir:—My last to your Excellency was of the 2d of March, since which an excruciating fit of the gout, which still deprives me of my right hand, has rendered me almost totally incapable of business
 As soon, however, as I was able to bear motion, I had myself brought down here to be at hand to forward the preparations for marching the detachments, and to keep the Assembly in mind of the necessity of recruiting the line, but can not boast of my success in the last instance, as there is nothing yet done in it, and the ses- sion has already boon drawn out to so great a length that I am very apprehensive the House will rise without taking the matter up
 The detachment, which will consist of nine hundred and sixty rank and file, properly officered to form three battalions, will march, I think, in about ten days, as I have reason to hope that money will be provided for them by that time
 A sufficient quantity of cloth- ing for that number sets off to-morrow for the different cantonments; and the arms and camp equipage will arrive at Yorktown, where the troops are ordered to assemble, in the course of the succeeding week
 I have ordered the four pieces of artillery that are with Colonel Proctor's regiment, with a proper detachment from it, to join this body, as it is probable, from the circumstances of the Ifith ult
, that General Greene may be in want of them
 The route I intend the whole shall pursue is from Yorktown by the head of Patapsco and Alexandria to Frcdericksburg, in Virginia, from whence Gen- eral Wayne will be best able to jndge of the route he must follow to join General Greene
 After this detachment marches, we may possibly collect three or four hundred more of the old soldiers, and that I think is the extent we have any reason to reckon on, so that unless the Assembly takes some very decisive steps the recruiting business will very soon be closed in this State
 Whatever may be determined upon, I shall take the earliest opportunity to acquaint 35

546 The StSt. Clair Papers
 your Excellency with it, and propose to pay you a visit as soon as able to ride
 Colonel Moylan's regiment is in such a situation, that it must be a considerable time before they can possibly move, having but eighty men aud fifty horses fit for service, in want of every equipment, and no money in any of the departments to procure them
 Au express arrived, last evening, from General Greene, who in- forms me that after laying three days at the iron works in expectation of Lord Conrwallis' advancing, and preparing himself for his recep- tion, he received accounts of his having suddenly retreated towards Cross Creek, leaving behind him all the wounded prisoners taken at Guilford,1 and his own hospital
 Colonel Stewart, of the guards, was killed in the action of Guilford
 General O'Harra, Colonel Tarletou, and Colonel AVebster, wounded, and from every circum- stance it appears they have suffered very severely
 Your Excel- lency must have heard of the arrival of the reinforcements in Chesapeake
 We have no accounts of any operations, except that they are plundering the inhabitants in small parties on both sides of the bay, some of which I am sure up as far as the head of Elk
 The inclosed is a return of Colonel Proctor's regiment
 The can- tonments are at such a distance, and the conveyance so uncertain that the returns are at hand very irregularly, but I shall endeavor to have them sent on by the time and in the manner desired by the Adjutant-General
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, April 15th, 1781
 Sir:—I have been favored with your Excellency's letter of the 8th inst
, which has been in great part answered by mine of the 6th
 In that, however, I was too sanguine as to the time when the detachment would march, which I fear it will not do in less than three weeks yet
 The application from the State to Congress for a loan of so much money as was necessary to put it in motion mis- carried, and there is now no hopes of any until a sufficient sum of the new money ordered to be struck by the House of Assembly can be got ready, which, the President informed me yesterday, would yet require a fortnight; and as the re-enlisted soldiers and new lTho battle of Guilford Court-House, N
 0
, was fought on the 15th of March
 Although a defeat for General Greene, it was disastrous to the British, as tho sudden retreat towards Virginia above mentioned proved

Page 547

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 547 levies have not received their bounties, nor the retained men the gratuity ordered them; and as one-third of the depreciated notes is to be paid by commissioners at the different cantonments, it is not extravagant to allow a week more to these affairs
 I do assure your Excellency that nothing has been left undone, on my part, to for- ward the march of the troops, or to reassemble the scattered rem- nants of the line, and there is a perfect good disposition in the offi- cers of all ranks to promote the recruiting, but the ridiculous mode that has been prescribed by the Council has, in a great measure, put it out of their power
 I can not help, however, being surprised that General "\Vavne (which, from your Excellency's letter to him, he must have done) should have given you expectations that the detachment would march much sooner, which, had there been no difficulty even about money, they could not have gone a day before the time marked in my former letter, on account of the want of clothing, arms, and camp equipage
 The Assembly have risen and though thev have not, as I suspected, left the recruiting unnoticed, they have done very little better, hav- ing only made some loose resolves for continuing the recruiting by voluntary enlistment under the direction of Council, and empower- ing them to raise the bounties as they may think proper, and that recruiting parties shall be kept in the State until the quota is com- pleted, which I am sure will not happen in that way during this war, should it last these fifty years
 Council have not yet made any order in consequence
 I very much suspect that I have set the number we may possibly collect after the march of the detachment considerably too high in my former letter, and I have no hopes at all from the recruiting, but the detachment will be completed to ninety-six rank and file
 General Knox, with your Excellency's approbation, has, I see, ordered a considerable addition of artillery
 The guns and stores will be in readiness, but Proctor's regiment is certainly not equal to so many pieces; and, if General Greene has not to spare, your Ex- cellency may think a further detachment from the corps of artillery necessary
 I am very sensible of tin; necessity of great exertion from all classes, but have but little hopes of seeing them; such a listlessness and inattention seems to have taken hold of the people that I doubt if even the cannon of the enemy would rouse them
 For my own part, I feel very sensibly yet the influence of both duty and patriot- ism, and I have made such representations to our humble bodies as I thought the nature of the case required, and beg leave to repeat

 that nothing in my power to second your Excellency's wishes shall be wanting
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW WINDSOR, April 25tft, 1781
 Dear Sir:—I have received your favors of the 6th and 15th
 I am sorry to find, from the last, that unavoidable obstacles have been thrown in the way of the march of the first division of the line at the time you expected
 I can only recommend to you to get them off" as soon as jwssible, and in as good temper as possible
 It is essential that General Greene should be regularly advised of the motions of those troops; you will, therefore, be pleased (if you have not already opened a correspondence with him) to inform him, from time to time, of every circumstance relating to them
 Captain Craig, of Colonel Proctor's regiment of artillery, who is stationed at Fort Pitt, has applied to me to have his companv com- pleted
 That can not be done in the present state of the regiment, but vou will be pleased to consult the commanding officer of it, and let Captain Craig have as many men as will put his companv on a level with the others
 I imagine Colonel Harrison's regiment, Colonel Procter's, a de- tachment with the Marquis, and a strong Maryland company lately gone from hence, will be sufficient to work tlic artillery that Gen- eral Greene will usually carry into the field with him

 As several of the parties must pass through Lancaster and there be supplied with provisions to carry them to Yorktown, your giving yourself the trouble to attend to that article in your way may facilitate their march, and prevent dis- appointment
 I wish you a prosperous journey, and all happiness
 P

—You will please to favor me with an account of the return of the numbers you march with, and direct the brigade quarter- master to forward a return of the camp equipage and utensils re- ceived by him
 Let me know, also, what number of arms were sent on to York
 If there is any surplus, they may be stored and left under the care of the commanding officer at that place, as also any surplus of blankets beyond that which completes the detachment
 GENERAL STSt. Clair1 TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, June 16, 1781
 Sir:—Upon my arrival at this place I found the Assembly met, and no apparent disposition amongst them to do any thing to for- ward the recruiting service; indeed, a passage in the President's message, which represents the line as in respectable strength, seemed calculated to induce them to believe it unnecessary
 I, therefore, thought it my duty to call their attention to that object, and wrote to the Speaker of the House upon the occasion; my letter was read, the business immediately referred to a committee, and another ap- pointed to bring in a bill
 From the report of the first, we had formed the most sanguine expectations that the line would have been filled immediately, and the necessity of sending militia to Vir- ginia superseded; but the bill which General Irvine has inclosed to your Excellency is in 
a very different spirit, and nothing is to be expected from it but disgusting the people
 It is distressing to see how things go on here; a considerable part, and much the most re- spectable, of the Legislature are disposed to do every thing that is necessary and that circumstances will admit, but the majority, under some mischievous influence, seem intent only on defeating the de- 1On the f,th cif Juno, General St
 Clnir addressed a very urgent appeal to the Pennsylvania Assembly for funds and necessary legislation to complete the enlistments
 He said thnt the enemy were making such rapid advances that, unless the most vigorous measures were taken, it would not only bo impossible to afford proper support to the Southern States, but they might soon have the mortification to feel the enemy in the heart of Pennsylvania

 signs of the others, without regard to the general welfare or the particular disgrace the State incurs
 The accounts from Virginia are vague and uncertain; but Corn- wallis has a force much superior to the Marquis, and, it is to be feared, will prevent the Baron [Stenbcn], who is at the Fork with about seven hundred new levies and some militia, from joining him
 Tarleton and Simcoe have been detailed to attack him, and though he may escape them, most probably the stores will fall into their hands, or be destroyed
 What his Lordship's designs are is hard to divine, but, as yet, he does not seem to intend fixing himself in that country, as I can not learn that he has, as yet, made one post, but is moving on with his army towards the Potomac, and ravaging the country below him with detachments
 I sometimes think he de- signs for Pennsylvania, nor is 1t altogether improbable; for though he has no force equal to a conquest, it would be a very effectual way of counteracting your Excellency
 General Wayne joined the Marquis on the 9th instant
 I have no accounts from him since he left Yorktown
 A letter of his of that day came to hand a few days ago; the inclosures I now trans- mit to your Excellency, though I doubt not he made similar reports to headquarters
 The deficiency has been occasioned by desertion and sickness; there now remain at the different cantonments about one hundred men, most of whom are unfit for duty
 Your Excellency will oblige me by marking the precise time it will be necessary for me to join the army
 I would not wish to de- lay it a moment, but the state of Mrs
 StSt. Clair's health (who I found very ill, and still continues so) makes me desire to postpone as long as the service will permit
 I hope Mrs
 Washington's health is perfectly re-established, and request you will do me the favor to present my compliments
 P
 S
—General Irvine, who is very uneasy at the inactive state he is obliged to remain in, has proposed to endeavor to raise some corps of volunteer horse and lead them to Virginia
 If it can be done, it may be of general service by turning the attention of the better class of people again to arms
 I have encouraged him in it, and hope it may meet with your Excellency's approbation
 GENERAL GREENE TO GENERAL STSt. Clair CAMP BUSH RIVER, S

 551 men are on their way to reinforce the Southern army; and it would give me particular pleasure to be informed that the second brigade was in readiness to move, and that you were at the head of the di- vision
 I am persuaded you will use every means in your power to for- ward the business, and l rely much upon your assiduity and atten- tion
 The critical situation of our affairs calls for every exertion
 The enemy are formidable in the field, and this army is reduced to a mere shadow from hard service and severe action
 Notwithstanding all our difficulties, we have been favored with some very important successes
 The enemy is divested of all of their posts in this State and Georgia, except Charleston, Savannah, and Ninety Six
 The last was closely besieged for near thirty days, and we were upon the point of reducing it, when Lord Raw- don, who has been reinforced from Europe, advanced to its relief, and obliged us to raise the siege
 I lament that we were not more successful in this enterprise, as the post is of great consequence to the enemy, and our troops have been exposed to excessive labor and annoyance in the attempt
 But these disappointments we shall ever be subjected to while the enemy continue masters- of the sea, and our force and means are so incompetent
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW WINDSOR, June 23, 1781
 Sir:—Yesterday I received your favor of the 16th
 I am much obliged by your care and attention for the public service
 I, at the same time, lament the small probability of success which you have reason to expect from the representation you give of the disposition of the Assembly of Pennsylvania
 Some favorable circumstance, or some adverse fortune, may very possibly yet draw forth their exertions
 Your zeal for the common cause, I dare say, notwith- standing these disagreeable prospects, will induce you to continue your utmost endeavors for the general good
 General Wayne has given me a similar return with that you have inclosed to me
 I am sorry to observe the smallness of his num- bers
 I hope, however, they will soon be increased
 Of the military stores you mention to have been left at York- town, you will be pleased to order such as want repairs to be sent to the laboratory at Carlisle, to be immediately fitted for use

 Those which are in order mav remain at York, and be delivered for the use of the next troops which may rendezvous at that place
 It appears somewhat strange to me, that our accounts of the oper- ations in Virginia are so vague and uncertain; equally unaccount- able appear to me to be the designs of Lord Cornwallis from his rapid and devious movements
 By his latter conduct, it would seem that the effect of all his operations in North and South Carolina are totally lost, and the enemy are likely again to be reduced to tLe pos- session only of Charleston
 The time of your joining the army must depend upon the ex- ertions of the State—their success in furnishing such number of troops to their line as shall give you a suitable command in the field

 HEADQUARTERS NEAR DOBBS' FERRY, July 10th, 1781
 Dear Sir:—I have been favored with yours of the 24th ult
 and 4th inst
 I am pleased to find by the first that the Assembly of Pennsylvania have at length passed a law which seems likely to pro- cure the number of men voted
 You certainly misunderstood me when you were at New Windsor, if you conceived it was my intention that you should servo this cam- paign with the army in this quarter
 I, at that time, foresaw the difficulty there would be in providing commands for the general officers who were already here, and which I have only been enabled to do by appointing General Heath and Lord Sterling to the com- mand of wings, which are in fact no more than divisions, and which also have their major-generals attached to them
 There would be an indelicacy, as you very justly observe, in sending you to Vir- ginia at present, because you must necessarily supercede Marquis do Lafayette, who has had much trouble, and who appears to be just now reaping the fruits of his labor; I can, therefore, only ad-

 553 vise you to remain in Pennsylvania a while longer, where you may be very usefully employed in fixing the levies under the new law, and at the same time have an opportunity of attending to Mrs
 StSt. Clair, whose situation I sincerely lament
 Should General Greene come into Virginia, the difficulty would cease, and you might go there at once without any inconvenience
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, July 22d, 1781
 Sir:—I have received your Excellency's letter of the 10th inst
, and am very sorry that the state of the army and the situation of affairs will not permit my being employed this campaign in that part of it under your Excellency's immediate command, and shall therefore prepare myself for a southern march; but there is no prob- ability that it can take place very soon, as there will be much dif- ficulty and delay in equipping the troops after they are raised, as the State of Pennsylvania has no money and little credit, and there is a great scarcity of the necessary articles of clothing
 From the present view I have of it, there seems little likelihood of any con- siderable body being in readiness much before the first of October; perhaps something may turn up to render it then unnecessary
 The Invalid Corps is at last in motion; nothing has delayed them so Ion it but the want of mouev, which Colonel Nichols has been in
 tf' defatigable to procure, and has at last succeeded for such a sum as has got them on board in tolerable temper
 A day or two before their embarkation, the inclosed list of charges against him were exhibited1 to me, but as they could not bo inquired into here, with- out detaining many of the officers, I thought it best to transmit them to your Excellency
 They have been communicated to him, but he is not arrested upon them; the taking him from the com- mand of the regiment at that time might'have been inconvenient
 Lieutenant Bigham's court-martial has never come to hand, and he remains here in a state of suspense
 If your Excellency has de- cided upon it, will you please to direct it to be scut on
 This will be delivered bv Major Dunn, who, as I have very little employment for him, wishes to be in a more active station until there is occasion for him

—Should Lord Cornwallis return to New York with all or the greater part of his force, will not the Pennsylvania levies be most wanted with you? Will you please to let me know your opinion upon that case?1 I believe you may expect all the infantry that have horse will go to Carolina
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL IRVINE
 LANCASTER, August 16, 1781
 My Dear General:—The alarm that my Lord Cornwallis has spread, and which produced my last letter to you by Dr
 Lyou, has brought one
 I thought then that the stroke at the prisoners that was feared was barely possible, but, as such, ought to be guarded against; and the Board of War detained me in town for a week, and at last con- sented to my going, under a promise to inform me when it might, or whether it might, be proper to countermand the order fur drawing our people together
 I was very glad to find, by your letter to Cap- tain Christie, which ^I met with and opened to-day, that you had forbid the march of the troops at Reading, concluding from thence that you would not now think it necessary to march those on the west side of the Susquehanna
 You will observe that I have di- rected the arms at 
 
 [several lines defaced] than they will be equipped; however, Council are doing what they can
 Woolen clothing it seems impossible to procure—only forty suits are on hand; but a number of hunting-shirts, which, though not the most desirable uniform, is better than none
 It seems that a letter of mine, immediately after my return from headquarters, you have not received
 It was, not, however, of consequence—con- taining only an information that we were to make a southern cam- paign together
 I had before regretted that you were destined to 1 Washington replied to tho nbove letter on tho 7th August at length
 Re- ferring to StSt. Clair's request ho said: "The movement of Lord Cornwallis, with the troops under his command, will probably bo soon decided
 On the circumstances of this event may hang many of our future movements, of which, so far 113 they relate to your command, you will be duly notified

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL IRVINE
 PHILADELPHIA, August 26, 1,781
 Dear Sir:—From the current report, and from the circumstances that a considerable part of the army are in Jersey, and some of them advanced as far as Trenton, it seems probable that some stroke is meditated to the southward; in which case, the General will cer- tainly expect that corps to be joined by the troops in this State
 I would, therefore, wish you to have all on the west side of Sus- quehauna in perfect readiness to move at a moment's waruing
 It is at present my intention to draw them to Lancaster, expecting, if my conjecture is right, that the whole will embark at the head of Elk; and I shall to-morrow order the different articles of clothing that arc provided to be sent to Lancaster, that the whole may be distributed there
 I am sorry, however, to inform you that it is not sufficient for the few men we have, although the upper garment consists of a hunting-shirt only
 Should this arrangement not be approved of, I will give you timely notice, and at auy rate advise when it will be proper to put the troops in motion
 Colonel Mentgez gave you, a few days ago, an extract from a letter of the General to me
 You will be pleased to give the most pointed orders about the returns, and I shall be glad to know exactly the amount of the two regiments and the recruits—the last, how- ever, I do not expect amount to much, if the people in these coun- ties, at least, have followed the example of those more interior
 I was favored with yours of the 15th
 The first certain account of the movements of Lord Cornwallis, I got from your letter to Captain Christie, which I met with betwixt Heading and Lancaster and opened
 Your orders in both cases were perfectly correspond- ent with those I had given; but I find a letter I had wrote you on my return from headquarters must have miscarried; it contained, however, nothing of any consequence
 I showed that part of yours relating to the armorers to the Board of War, but they had given their orders; they do not mean, it seems, to remove the stores, etc
 Whenever I receive any account from headquarters, I shall write you again

 Dear Sir:—I have to request you immediately to assemble all the recruits in the State of Pennsylvania at their respective places of rendezvous, where they may be properly equipped to march, on the shortest notice, to the southward; and those recruits that are raised in the State of Delaware, I wish you to infirm whoever has the di- rection of them, that they assemble at Wilmington and must be in the utmost readiness so as to march when they receive any further orders
1 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL IRVINE
 September 6, 1781
 Dear Sir: — In my last, I gave you my conjectures about the movements of the army, and requested you to have the men on the west side of the Susquehanna in readiness to march to Lancaster and to scud the arms to that place, expecting that they would march from thence to the head of the Elk
 I am now to inform you that they are to march by laud to the southward, in con- sequence of which they will rendezvous at Yorktown, as soon as camp equipage can be sent on for them, which, together with the clothing, I am in hopes to accomplish by Sunday or Monday next; and, if the arms have not already been sent to Lancaster, you will please to countermand the order
 The General left Philadelphia yesterday with the first division of the French troops, and was pre- ceded by General Lincoln with a division of Americans, and the second division of the French troops marched to-day
 This moment a gentleman arrived from town with this day's paper, in which is a letter of the General's to the President of Congress, from Chester, in- forming that he had just received the account of the arrival of the 1In attempting to carry out the above order, General StSt. Clair found that the paymaster did not have the necessary funds, and he thereupon applied to Congress, through Hon

 It is added to a letter from General Gist, that they had taken a British frigate at the mouth of York River, and landed three thousand men on the south side of James River, so that it seems highly probable that Lord Cornwallis is in the toils, and can not escape
 Lord Rawdon, too, was taken in packet from Charleston
 It is very mortifying that we should have no chance for a share in this business—it certainly must be over before we can get up, but we may possibly get in at the death before Charleston

 POTTSGROVE, September 14, 1781
 Dear Sir:—Your favor of the 1st, by Mr
 Duncau, came to hand two days ago, and, on the evening of the same day, I received that by Major Moore, inclosing the court-martial
 He had sent it for- ward to General Mifflin, who had never thought of it
 I am sorry it has been delayed so long, for, when punishment follows crimes so slowly, the effect of it is, in a great measure, lost
1 I issued an order yesterday approving the sentences, and directed Nagle and Gill to be hanged at such time and place as you think proper, find pardoned the others that were condemned to death, and ordered the punishment to be inflicted on the others, except Charles Kelly, to whom I have remitted it
 I find I was much mistaken about the time when the camp equip- age and equipments would be got a-
vay from Philadelphia—a thous- and obstructions have come in the way, and, what is most provoking, 1It would scom, from the following order, which I find in the handwrit- ing uf General StSt. Clair, directed to General Irvine, that military trials then •were almost as much delayed as civil trials of the present day: (Without date) 1781
 Sir:— I find in the report of the guard this morning, a man confined two and forty days
 Unless theie is something very particular that prevents it, you will pleaso to order a ciurt-martial for his trial, and the other prisoners who arc accused of desertion

 • obstructions that might have been easily removed or avoided—in- deed, they appear to have been laid with a design to retard us— however, by Monday every thing will set out, and the detachment will be ordered to York by the time these may arrive
 One month's pay in specie will be paid, which is all I could obtain, but there is every reason to believe it will be regular in future
 I do not doubt but the detachment in Virginia may be in want of some articles of clothing, but their distress can not be such as it is represented, or very little care has been taken of them—indeed, these representa- tions were made to me before they reached Potomac River; but, be it as it may, I can do nothing for them at present
 Colonel Butler would have been very acceptable to me, but it is Colonel Craig's tour of duty and he will go on it
 Please present my compliments to Colonel Butler
 I have received his letter, and will answer it by the first opportunity; at present I have not time

 PHILADELPHIA, Scpfcmbe

 Sir:—On receipt of this you will immediately put your corps in motion for this place—-every man and horse that is able to move, and take provisions at Lancaster to bring them here
 The exigency is pressing, and I request that not a moment may be lost
 If your clothing is not arrived and you should meet it on the road, which I wish you to be attentive to, you must either bring it back or distribute it where you meet it, as may be most convenient
 If the last, it will be the best, as these people will return with great reluctance
 PRESIDENT REED TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, September 21, 1781
 Sir:—In the present situation of affairs, I should be happy in being assisted with your good judgment and advice in forming such arrangements as may be most effectual for drawing forth the strength and resources of the State in the most effectual manner, and con- certing a previous general plan for this purpose, and defending this city
 I shall, therefore, beg the favor of your company in Market street at 1 o'clock, to meet a few other gentlemen proper to be consulted on such an occasion

 GLAIR TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 PHILADELPHIA, September 2!)</t, 1781
 Sir:—I have been honored with your Excellency's letter of the 15th instant,1 which came to band on the 2tith
 Previous to the receipt of it, Congress had ordered me to draw all the levies of this State to Philadelphia, from an apprehension that strongly prevailed and some intelligence they credited, that Sir Henry Clinton, with a body of about five thousand men, intended, by way of diversion to your Excellency's operations, or to counterbalance your success, to visit this city and either plunder or destroy it
 It appeared, in deed, to me a very improbable movement, for, though it might have been possible for him to force his way through Jersey to the banks of the Delaware, the passage of that river might have been ren- dered doubtful, and the Jersey militia with the troops General Heath might throw down to their assistance would have made a retreat very difficult
 If he attempted it by water, the difficulty of return- ing was increased, and the danger of losing all his ships added to it
 Your Excellency's letter was immediately communicated to Con- eress, and this day they have repealed the order and left me at lib- erty to join the army, which I shall do with as much expedition as possible, and, I hope, I need not assure your Excellency that the being detained here in a state of idleness when the army is in the field has been a most mortifying circumstance, and what I would have stndiously avoided had the prospects been ever so unpromis- 1 The letter of General Washington referred to, contained an earnest ap- peal Cor more troops to assist him in his operations against Cornwallis
 It exhibited H good deal of impatience
 He could not understand why the re- cruits for the Pennsylvania linn should be held hack for clothing or equip- menU, while others were '-doinir dutv in the field, and oombatlins almost • every distress imaginable in the want of every necessary
" He, therefore, ordered the troops to be marched forthwith by water to the James River, Virginia
 The letter of St
 Ciair explains why the troops had been detained
 Congress had become alarmed, fearini; lest Sir Henry Clinton should make a descent on Philadelphia, and refused to let StSt. Clair or the recruits leave the State
 Following is the order in the case: "By the United States, in Congress Assembled: "ORDERED, That Major-General StSt. Clair cause the levies of the Pennsyl- vania line in Pennsylvania, to rendezvous at or near Philadelphia, with all possible expedition
" Under this order the troops had been collected at Philadelphia, but upon the receipt of the peremptory letter of General Washington before referred to, and the representation of General StSt. Clair, the order was rescinded, and the troops immediately marched to join the army

 ing
 They are now so favorable as might tempt forward the least inclined to the service
 Neither has there been any neglect to for- ward the equipment of the detachment
 The delay has arisen from cruel necessity; their march, however, will be rather expedited by their having been brought here, as it will render wagons needless, which I believe the quartermaster would not have been able to pro- cure, nor has Mr
 Morris had it in his power to give them one far- thing, which has so soured both officers and men that I dread the con- sequences
 The Assembly have passed a law to raise money for the recruiting service upon the delinquents under the former law; it will be some time, however, before it will be produced

 Lord Coruwallis has not yet given up the ghost, but he will be now constrained to sur- render, and I think myself very fortunate to have got up before it took place, more especially as I find the command of the American army vacant for me

1 CAMP, NEAR YORK, October 25, l781
 Sir:—By the bearer, one of my aids, you will receive the papers laid by you before his Excellency, General Washington, relative to the goods and clothing brought by you in the flag-vessel General de Beidescl, which have been submitted by him to a board of general officers; and, as it has been made clearly to appear to them that the vessel was diverted from her proper voyage and part of the cargo applied to purposes not only different but contrary to those for which the passport was granted, your request to proceed with them to the German Convention troops can not be complied with
 The goods, according to the custom of nations and the laws of war, are forfeited, and you are desired to deliver them forthwith to the clothier of the American army, who has orders to take them into his possession
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 [Instructions
] NEAR YORK, IN VIRGINIA, October 2!), 1781
 Kir:— The detachment of which you will have the command, for 1 Captain Gcrlach, deputy quartermaster to the Brunswick troops, was in charge of a flag-vessel, Gcncrnl tie Reidesel, having on board clothing and provisions for the Convention troops
 He touched at Portsmouth, where a British General gave permission to British Commissary Hookshy, who was included with him in the passport, to dispose of other goods Umt hud been shipped on the vessel to the troops at that place
 When Lord Cornwallis arrived there, Gerlach applied for permission to proceed with the clothing for the Convention troops, but was refused, his Lordship considering the vessel BF under the protection of the flag
 The vessel was afterwards ordered to York, lit which place the clothing and provisions intended for the Convention troops were delivered to the garrison during the seige
 At the time of the capitula- tion
 Captain Gerlach asked Cornwallis to make provision for the goods brought for tho Brunswick Convention troops, who declined, and advised him to lay the matter before General Washington
 He did so, and General Washington referred the business to a board of officers, of which General StSt. Clair was president
 It was decided that the protection due to the flag was lest by permitting goods not embraced in the permit to be shipped to the British army actively engaged in the field, and, consequently all the pub- lie property was forfeited, as well as the private merchandise
 The clothing thus forfeited was valued at more than £15,000, a part of which the Colonial Treasurer Morris agreed to take
 The sum paid each officer in the army be- fore Yorktown, £'20
 StSt. Clair suggested that bills be drawn accordingly

 the southward, is to consist of the Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia Continental troops
 You will march them by the most convenient route, and in the most expeditious manner, without fatiguing the troops, towards Wilmington, in North Carolina, of which, or other posts ill that State, you will endeavor to dispossess the enemy, if their situation, from the intelligence you shall receive as you advance, shall, in your judgment, render it practicable and advisable
 If it does not, you will continue your march to the Southern army, and put your- self under the command of Major-General Greene
 As Wilmington, and other places in North Carolina, may cease to be objects, from a change of circumstances in the States to the southward of this, it will be necessary for you to open an immedi- ate communication, by letter, with General Greene, and govern yourself by his advice and orders; and it may be well to communi- cate, in confidence" to the executive of the State of North Carolina the enterprise against Wilmington, that you may procure such in- formation and aid as it may be in their power to give
 For ordnance and stores, and for the means of transportation and other matters in the quartermaster's department, you will con- sult General Knox and Colonel Pickering, and will make your ar- rangements with the commissary or State agent for supplies of provision

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR NELSON
 CAMP, AT RICHMOND, November 9, 1781
 Sir:—I am sorry to be obliged to trouble you in your present in- disposition, from which, however, I am happy to hear you are re- covering
 Having left York with a very large convoy of military stores and a considerable train of artillery for the southward, with horses scarce able to carry themselves, but which were the best could be procured, and flattered with the expectation that I could be supplied in this State, I have reached this place, but on application to the council, on that account, have been informed that the authority of your Excellency was absolutely necessary (a sufficient number of
Page 563

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 563 councilors not being assembled to do any act of themselves)
 Fifty horses, at least, must be exchanged here, and then it will be with difficulty I shall be able to proceed
 I have, therefore, to request your Excellency to grant an impress warrant for that number, and if you should think proper to make it include a greater, you may be assured that a wanton use will not be made of it
 If your Excel- lency can not comply with the request, I shall l>e reduced to the ne- cessity of taking horses where they can he had as the others fail, which 
will be attended with much inconvenience and delay; beside*, the circumstances of the people from whom they may be taken can not be attended to, and the disgust that attends all acts of mere power will rankle in their minds, and may, hereafter, impede the public service
 The object of my march is important, and requires all possible dispatch, and I am sure you will give every assistance in your power
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 RICHMOND, November 14, 1781
 Sir:—On the afternoon of the 9th instant I arrived at this place, and this day will have all the troops and stores over the river
 You will, doubtless, be surprised at the time that the passage will have taken up, and, indeed, it has been a very mortifying delay to me; but notwithstanding that Major Clayborne, the quartermaster-gen- eral for the >State, had been sent forward to make the necessary preparations to give us dispatch, I found not the smallest provision was made either for that purpose, or to procure forage for our horses, and I have been forced to get on the best way I could with the common ferry-boats, only one of which would take in a wagon
 The quartermasters seem to be every-where a very useless set of people, but peculiarly so here
 I could not even obtain one of them (and they are numerous) to go forward to Petersburg!!, that the same difficulty might not again meet us there; however, means are taken to prevent that happening
 Your Excellency knows the wretched condition in which the horses were when I left York, particularly those that drew the pieces, and I mentioned the hopes I had of meeting with some assistance from the Government here; unfortu- nately, the Governor is too sick to attend to business, and there is neither council nor assembly
 However, sixty horses arrived last night from Annapolis for General Greene's army; these I must de- tain, and, by means of them, I shall be able to get forward without

 seizing from the inhabitants, which I must otherwise have been obliged to do, and from which I am glad to be relieved, lx>th on ac- count of the unequal manner in which the burden falls, and the disgust it creates
 On the 10th, I sent an express to Colonel Febiger, at Cumber- land Court-house, directing him to put the Virginia troops, which I expected would at least have amounted to five hundred men, in mo- tion for Taylor's Ferry, and yesterday received the inclosed letter in return, by which your Excellency will see that the utmost I'can ex- pect of them is one hundred and fifty men, which will make General Gist's brigade about five hundred, and, with General Wayne's, may enable us to bring twelve hundred men to action
 I have inclosed the returns for your own particular satisfaction
 The accounts I have from Carolina are from General Jones, of the 9th instant
 The enemy still occupy Wilmington—their force about four hundred British and six hundred Tories; they have erected some works about the town, and have a block-house at a bridge over the Northeast River, about ten miles above it
 About two thousand militia have taken post on the south side of Cai« Fear River, with a view to prevent the enemy from crossing by land to Charleston GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL GREENE
 RICHMOND, November 14, 1781
 Sir:—I have the honor to acquaint you that I am now on my march, with the Pennsylvania and Maryland troops, to join your army, and shall leave this place to-morrow for Petersburg and Tay- lor's Ferry, at which I propose to cross the Roauoke
 The route I shall afterward pursue through North Carolina is not at present fully determined, and will depend upon such intelligence of the force and situation of the enemy in that country as I may receive; for should it be such as offers a probability of making a successful stroke at them en passant, I shall do it, and join you as soon after as possible
 Whenever I shall have fixed upon it, I shall take care to give you as early notice as l can, and it is not improbable but you may have it in your power to co-operate with me
 But as from our successes in this State, there may have hap{>ened a total change of circumstances in the Southern States, you will oblige me much by communicating what may have come to your knowledge, and I shall be happy to receive your orders and advice

 WILMINGTON, November 18, 1781
 Dear General:—I have been informed you are marching to the southward with a body of Continental troops, and that you intended to take this place in your route
 I am happy to inform vou that the glorious event of the 17th ult
 in Virginia has probably extended its influence to this post, seeing the enemy evacuated it with great precipitation on the 14th hist
, supposed to be ordered to reinforce Charleston
 This circumstance may, perhaps, induce you to alter the route of your nrmy
 This country has suffered so extremely whilst under the enemy's influence, that it would be scarcelv possible to subsist an army here, even for a short time
 The bridges, which are numerous in these parts, have also been destroved; repairing them will be a business of time
 I shall hold post here a few davs until the enemy are entirely gone, as some of their vessels are yet seen at the mouth of the harbor
 Whether detained by the weather, or seeing vessels tiff, we can not tell, but we flatter ourselves they can hardly reach Charleston
 I shall with pleasure receive your orders, if you think proper to write me, and shall also convey you the earliest notice of every event which may appear to interest the public welfare in these parts
 Perhaps you will find it most convenient to direct your march past Cross Creek, as I have ordered provisions to be driven and col- lected at that post, and others adjoining, purposely to supply your army
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 TAYLOR'S FERRY, November 26tfi, 1781
 Sir :— On the 22d instant I arrived at Williamsborough, in North Carolina, to which place I had gone in advance of the troops (leav- ing them to be conducted from Petersburgli bv General Wayne), in order to settle the route it would be proper to pursue, and take the necessary measures for provisions
 1Griffith Rutherford, appointed u brigadier by tho Provincial Congress, in April, 1776; commanded u brigade in the buttle near Camden, August 1780, where ho was t iken prisoner, and, having been exchanged, commanded in North Carolina when the British evacuated Wilmington
 After the war, he removed to Tennessee, where he died about 171)4

Page 566

560 The StSt. Clair Papers
 A report had prevailed, for a day or two, that the enemy had evacuated "Wilmington, aud there l received such information re- specting it as left no manner of doubt of the fact, which happened oil the 14th instant, two large ships, which lay in the mouth of Cupe Fear River, having taken the garrison on board, which, no doubt, are gone to Charleston
 This circumstance leaves me at liberty to take the most direct way to join General Greene, which I shall do with as much expedition as possible by Salisbury, Charlotte, and Camden, which, though not absolutely the nearest route, is never- theless, from the best information I have been able to procure, much the easiest aud most plentiful, and by following of which time will be gained
 As the evacuation would have taken place at all events, it is fortunate for the troops that it happened so early, as they would have been exposed to much difficulty in a march through a very barren country, intersected by many rivers that are not fordable
 Whether I should reckon it fortunate for myself, or not, I am not so certain
 But I am always satisfied with what produces any ad- vantage to my country, and another State being freed from the power of the enemy is a circumstance of no little importance at this juncture
 It has also l'reed me from an uneasiness that hung upon my mind, that I might probably find them so posted as not to have it in my power to dislodge them, and be reduced to the alternative of an uncertain assault, or that of leaving them unmolested
 Since I sat down to write, a letter has come to hand from Colonel Febiger, by which I am informed that I can expect no part of the Virginia troops, as they are not in a condition to be marched at present
 It also contains the copy of a letter, or memorial, from the officers to him, on their being made acquainted with the orders I had sent for immediately marching to this place all the men that were equipped, which I take the liberty to inclose
 It is true that they have reason to complain, but it pains me that they should take such means and such an occasion to express it; and I was much surprised to see Colonel Posey's name to the memorial
 I have wrote to Colonel Febiger, and taken no notice of the receipt of his letter, desiring him to halt the detachment I had ordered un- til the whole are in readiness, as it is now too late for them to join me, and, from a change of circumstances in North Carolina, it is not so necessary

, November 28</t, 1781
 Sir:—The enemy having- left Wilmington has determined me to pursue n different route to South Carolina than that I had in contemplation, and I have to request that you will direct provisions to be laid in for three thousand men, on the road from this place to Camdeu, by the High Rock Ford, Guilford, Salisbury, and Char- lotteburgh
 The particular places I can not so well point out, where our day's marches will end, not being perfect master of the dis- tances, bin the general direction to the High Rock Ford will be Ilarrisburgh, Colonel Stephen Moore's, Caswel Court-house, and Henry Williams';?
 We shall want provisions, bread especially, at as many places on our march as it can be laid in with any conven- ience, as we have not the means to carry above one or two days' sup- ply with its
 The intermediate places between Guilford and Char- lotte I have not mentioned, but doubt not you will be able to direct the commissioners to make deposits for us, where it is proper and convenient
 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 PHILADELPHIA, 30$ November, 1781
 Dear Sir:—I have received your favor of the 14th instant, and am very sorry to observe the difficulties and impediments which have attended the march of the troops under your command; they are such as I feared, but such as I trust the resources of your genins will surmount
 The returns you inclosed I am sorry to see so small; the deficiency in numbers must be made up in the vigor of your operations
 Your prospects against Wilmington, I think, are not unpromising, on the ground you mention—though there is no accounting for the events of war
 If your attempt should fail, whatever may be the censures of the- people at the moment of the event, yet, I doubt not that your character will eventually obtain that justice which I flatter myself your conduct will ever merit, an instance of which you have already had in the course of this war
 Inclosed you will find extracts from the resolutions of Congress on the occasion of our late success in Virginia
 I transmit them to you, to be communicated to the troops under your command, that they may know the sense in which Congress are pleased to estimate their late services

 Colonel Febiger's return of Virginia troops appears to me very extraordinary
 I fear that a dislike of the Southern service, or some other reasons, have operated to lessen their numbers beyond what ought to be
 I wish you, sir, to write to him in the most pressing manner, to bring on every man engaged for a permanent term, and who is possibly able to march, and let him know that no excuse can possibly be admitted for unneces

 Dear Sir:—From intelligence received, I have reason to believe that the enemy mean to make a push into the country to destroy the forage; to prevent which, I have to request that you will march on with all possible dispatch without injury to the troops, and bring with you thirty thousand cartridges as a supply for this army
 You will move by McCord's ferry, on the Congaree, Oraugeburg, and Ferguson's Mill, on the Edisto to this place
 I have received your letter of the 14th of November, dated at Richmond, but as Captain Pendleton, one of my aide-de-camp, was charged with instructions and a letter to you,1 I thought an answer would be unnecessary
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 CAMP NEAR OSBORNE'H, February 4th, 1782
 Sir:—Your very obliging letter of the 30th of November, came to hand about ten days ago, and the Resolve of Congress was com- municated to the troops, with which they appeared to be highly satisfied
 Nothing could have been more acceptable than the kind manner your Excellency has been pleased to speak of my conduct
 I do, indeed, aspire to your approbation, and do flatter myself that in all events, whether fortunate or otherwise, I shall never do any thing to forfeit your esteem
 1Captain N
 Pcndleton, aid-de-camp, sent a message to General StSt. Clair, from Warsaw settlement, November '
Mill, by which he conveyed the wishes ot General Greene, which were, that he would leave his heavy baggage and stores, and all of the artillery except four pieces, and hasten to his assistance

 569 I joined General Greene on the 3d of January, after a march of fifty-seven days, during which we had a great deal of bad weather, yet, notwithstanding, averaged about eleven miles for each day, without fatigue to the troops, who performed it without murmur or discontent, and, since our arrival, the enemy have not shown their noses, and I believe are impressed with the idea that my detachment is a very great one
 The situation of my private affairs requires my attention to them this summer, which, if I do not give, they must go to absolute ruin
 I, therefore, propose to leave this country with that view, about the beginning of April, if circumstances will admit it, and I think it highly probable that if we have no opportunity to tight the enemy before that time, it will not happen at all, aud that they will either evacuate the country entirely, or content themselves with holding the possession of Charleston, until a treaty of peace shall take place, an event all the officers think very near
 I hope we shall not think it so near as to neglect the necessary preparations for continuing the war, which is much to be feared, but which I hope will be prevented by your Excellency having your residence this winter in Philadelphia
 Congress,lam informed, have lately vested your Excellency with power to employ such general officers as you may think proper, the others to retire upon half-pay until called for
 I am very loth to leave the army whilst the war continues, and yet I do not think I can possibly return to this country; not from any dislike to the service here, but simply from the situation of my family and affairs
 I could wish that your Excellency would not absolutely determine for my return, before I have the pleasure to see you, or that you will hear from me on the subject again

 Dear General:—In consequence of the resolution of Congress of 1General St
 Chiir commanded the lines of investment nround Charleston, while in South Carolina, but the dreary business of u siege brought no stir- ring events worth recording
 Correspondence was carried on with Colonel Small und 
Major Prevost
 of the British army, which bore chiefly on com- munications between the beleagured Tories and their friends in the country Frequent attempts at imposition finally led to an order forbidding all inter- course
 In the month of May
 StSt. Clair returned to Philadelphia, being compelled thereto by the embarrassed stute of his finances

 the 7th of August last, directing a reform of the army to take place on the 1st of January, 1783, 1 do myself the honor of "inclosing you a return of the non-commissioned officers and privates belonging to the Pennsylvania line, specifymg the number enlisted for the war, and those whoso times shortly expire
 Perhaps you may jndge it necessary to lay this return before the Secretary of War, in order that he may be enabled to make his arrangements accordingly
 A list of our officers, with their determination to continue in service or retire, I have handed in to General Greene, which I Apprehend will be transmitted to you by this conveyance
 Since your departure from this arniy, we have frequently ex- perienced a want of provisions, chiefly owing to the neglect of the State Commissary, but are now agreeably relieved with beef toler- able good and plenty
 Sickness rages to an amazing degree; in the course of this month we have buried near one hundred men, with the cursed disorder, ague and fever, incidental to the climate
 The sweet, delicious Northern breeze I am panting after, and long to snuff the fragrant gale
 We have been in great hopes of the enemy evacuating Charleston for this month past, they have certainly made every preparation for embarking, and I believe now only wait the arrival of transports
 Had they ere tin's arrived, the autumnal ecpiinox would have prevented their going
 The 20th of October, I set down as the day we are tc enter the town—a joyful day it will be! Our present position is about sixteen miles from Charleston, with our left to the Ashley, and reckoned by the inhabitants as healthy a spot as is in South Carolina, but we are prejndiced against it; the climate at this season breathes nothing but disorder, and ill agrees with Northern constitutions
 You, no doubt, have hoard the unfortunate fate of Colonel Lau- rens; he was killed the 27th of last month, in a conflict with a de- tachment of the enemy foraging in the Combahee River
 His fall is greatly lamented
 I shall be happy in being honored with a line from you

 CAMP ASHLEY HILL, December 16, 1782
 Dear General:—I had the pleasure of addressing you per Lien- tenant Harper, on the 29th of September last, since which we have been in continual expectation of the evacuation of Charleston

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 571 That joyful event took place the day before yesterday

 At 8 o'clock m the moruing, the light infantry companies, the legion and two six-pounders, under command of Brigadier-General Wayne, took possession of the town
 The army still keeps its old position
 What our future destination will be is yet unknown
 Orders have arrived from the Secretary of War, to form the Pennsylvania troops into one regiment; the formation has taken place, and General Greene has ordered the officers present upon the spot to be arranged; inclosed you will please to receive a copy of the arrangement
 This strikes at the principle of seniority, and must displease the senior captains and subalterns in the State
 My mode of arranging, upon a supposition that we raise two regiments only, would be thus: The oldest captain in the first regiment
 The next oldest in the second regiment, and the same rule to be adopted with the subalterns
 But the grand objection to this arrangement would be that the troops would remain without officers; therefore, Gpueral Greene, to avoid fluctuation, has thought proper to arrange the officers here upon the spot, and his intention is that the arrangement should be permanent
 In consequence of the resolve of Congress of the 7th August last, which directs a reform of the army to take place on the 1st of Jan- uary next, and that the staff officers shall be taken from the retir- ing officers, I have resigned my post of Adjutant-General of the Southern army, and taken immediate command of the regiment
 The General has been pleased (in orders) to compliment my con- duct while in that department
 Major Edwards is my successor, and Lieutenant-Colonel Meutgez is appointed inspector to the Southern army
 I do myself the honor of inclosing you a copy of the last return of the regiment
 I expect, in a few days, to be able to obtain cloth- ing sufficient for the men, and then we shall cut the proper military appearance
 Be pleased to present my compliments to Dunn and Keene

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WASHINGTON
 November 26th, 1782
 Dear Sir:—Agreeably to my promise, I ought, in a very few days, to set out on my return to the army, but, I am sorry to say it, I find it will be impossible at the time I proposed, as I am now so far from having completed the purpose for which your Excellency was pleased to nllow me to be absent as the day of my arrival
 I have had several interviews with Mr
 Morris; he says, and I am sure it is so, that he is making every exertbu in order for a hand- some payment to the army, and that he has expectations of soon having it in his power, but that, notwithstanding it depends upon so many contingencies, he will not venture to iix upon the time
 I could not ask him for a partial payment to me, though I am per- suaded that, if he had been in cash, from the friendship that has long subsisted betwixt us, he would have offered it, as I let him very ex- plicitly into my present circumstances, which is, in short, Sir—I am not master of one single shilling, nor will any thing that I am pos- sessed of e:> m maud it; I am in debt, and my credit exhausted, and, were it not for the rations I receive, my family would actually starve
 This is rather hard, afcer sacrificing, as I have done, ease and inde- pendence, and the best part of my life, and having settled accounts in my hands for more than three thousand pounds, and considerable sums due, the accounts of which have not yet been liquidated
 This will, I hop?, induce you to excuss my overstaying the time limited for my return, whilst you do me the justice to believe that, whatever uneasiness I feel from the distress of my private circumstances, which, I own, is not a little, I have not less from being forced to a breach of my duty, the first of the kind in my whole life, and that I shall be happy to return to it the moment I can, by any means, put myself in a situation
1 1 The distressed situation in which General StSt. Clair's family were placed in 178'J, by the fniluro of the Government to pay him what was due to him caused him thu greatest pain and anxiety
 Hu had
 hitherto, made up all de- ficiencies out of his own private means, but when landed property no longer brought even a twentieth of its value, that source failed
 When in South Carolina, he wrote a pressing letter to the President of Congress, asking that his accounts might be settled and some of the sums he had paid- out for the Government refunded; and, when he returned to Philadelphia ho laid full details of his condition before his friend Robert Morris
 The latter tympa- thized deeply, and assisted him to the extent of his power; but it was a time when he was straining every nerve to supply means to keep troops in

 573 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL McDouoALL, COLONEL OODEN, AND COLONEL BROOKS, A COMMITTEE FROM THE ARMY AT WEST POINT, TO CONGRESS
1 December (without ilay~), 1782
 Gentlemen:—As it is of consequence that the representations to tho fiejd
 II"\v ho found relief for his family is not told in his papers, but that the trial was a long and distressful one, is shown by the fact that ho was able to remain with the army but a few days in December, and thnt Washington found it necessary to recall him in February
 See letter of the 19th February
 1The close of the year 1782 and tho winter of 1783, when there was A prospect of peace, but an uncertainly as to whether or not negotiations might fail and a new campaign be required, was a period of great unxicty to the lending patriot-', and of very great danger to the cause of a
 republic
 There seemed to bo no resources left, mid there was a total want of harmony between Congress and the States
 In October, 1782, Washington wrotrt to the President of Congress, referring to the proposition to reduce the army: "I can not help fearing the result of the measure in contemplation, under present circumstances, when I see such a number of men goaded by u thou- sand stings of reflection on the past and of anticipations of the future, about to be turned into the world, soured by penury and what they cull the in- gratitude of the public, involved in debts, without one'farthing of money to carrv them home, after having spent the flower of their days, and many of them their patrimonies, in establishing the freedom and independence of their country, and suffered every thing that human nature is capable of en- during on this side of desth
 I repeat it, that when I consider these irri- tating circumstances, without one thing to soothe their feelings or dispel the gloomy prospects, I can not avoid apprehending that a train of evils" will follow of a very serious and distressing nature
 On the other hand, could the officers be placed in as good a situation as when they came into service, the contention, I am persuaded, would be, not who should continue in the field, but who should retire to private life
" When the army had taken up their winter-quarters at New burg, and, during the days of idleness, reflected fia their situation, with accounts un- settled, and no provision for future liquidation of them, there was much ex- citement, which resulted, finally, in the appointment of a committee to wait on Congress and explain tho grievances of the army
 The committee con- sisted of General McDougall and Colonels Ogden and Brooks
 Tho memo- rial which they wero charged to present embraced tho following points: 1
 Present pay; 2
 A settlement of the accounts of the arrearages of pay and security for what is due; 3
 A commutation of tho half pay allowed by different resolutions of Congress for an equivalent in gross; 4
 A settlement of the accounts of deficiencies of rations and compensation; and 5
 A set- tlement of the accounts of deficiencies of clothing and compensation
 This was courteously received by Congress, and resolutions adopted look-

 be made to Congress on the part of the army should be gensnil, and all the different Hues agreed as to the subject of the proposition, but from their situation it is impossible that the sense of some of them—of the Pennsylvania Hue in particular—can be known in time to be conveyed to you, I have thought it might be of some use to state what I conceive ought to be their sense of matters, which you are at liberty to make such use of as you shall jndge most conducive to the end in view
 The State of Pennsylvania very liberally adopted the resolution of Congress recommending the half pay, and has enacted a law entitling the officers who shall con- tinue in service until the end of the war to receive it during the residue of their lives, but they have provided no funds nor ap- pointed any mode for the payment of it
 As this law was founded on a promise of Congress, the Pennsylvania line will not consider the United States as discharged from the obligation of that promise should the State fail to carry the law into execution, and would cer- tainly be very desirous that a fund should be provided by their au- thority to render the receipt of the half-pay unequivocal; and it is indeed a very reasonable and modest expectation that some provision should be made for them in the future, as a recompense for the time they have given to the public, for the sacrifice of their best years and all their prospects in life; and perhaps it might not be amiss to remind Congress that when they took up arms it was not with a view to make them a profession
 Certainly, had it been expected that the war would have been drawn out to the length it has been, many, particularly those who have families, and have thereby ruined •them, would not have engaged in it
 I say, then, I have no doubt but that, at the same time that they have the firmest reliance upon the honor and generosity of the State, they would be glad to see a ing to an adjustment of the claims
 Pending the negotiations—there being a divergence of views of the States as to the question of hulf pay—the ex- c•iienient in eamp was heightened bv the apper
rance of anonymous appeals, caleulated to inflame the 
 passions of the men, and giving rise to the suspicion that Congress would be deposed and a government established with Wash- ington at the head
 The latter was equal to the emergency, and by rare tact brought patriotism to the front, and succeeded in getting a declaration from the soldier? in that spirit, proposing to uphold the government
 The authorship of the remarkable papers was attributed to General John Arm- strong

 575 counter-security established by Congress
 Neither is the forming a fund all that strikes me as necessary; the application of it should likewise be pointed out—that is, an officer should know with cer- tainty the qualifications that will be necessary to entitle him to re- ceive it, and the times and the place to which he mast resort
 As for past pay, I take it for granted there is no reason to expect it will be paid up
 That must, therefore, be put on u footing to secure the payment of the interest regularly
 Whether it would not be the best mode with respect to that to coalesce with the other public creditors is worthy of very serious consideration
 It appears to me that it would have this consequence: that an interest in favor of the p
rmy as general public creditors would be created in each State, and the whole thereby have a l>etter chance of being provided for; whereas, were the army to insist upon a special and separate pro- vision, the weight of the other creditors would be ajniinst them, as C? removing a provision for themselves to a greater distance
 As to the accruing pay for the present and every succeeding year, Con- gress ought to be informed, in the most express and positive terms, that it is of absolute necessity that, without an immediate payment and a certainty of it in future, at stated periods for that and every succeeding year, the army can not be kept together, and that with- out it there is every reason to expect a convulsion of the most dreadful nature and fatal consequences
 These, then, I take it, would be the expectations of the Pennsylvania officers, viz: a Con- tinental security for their half-pay and arrears of pay, and an as- surance of their current pay in future
 As to other demands, they are precisely in the same situation with the rest of the army
 What satisfies that, will doubtless satisfy them
 Permit me to remark that, whatever mode is adopted to produce that purpose, the whole army ought to throw themselves upon Congress
 The services that have been performed, from which the right to the demand arises, have been performed for the United States; that, separately, the States are not bound to recognize them, and that whatever disposi- tions some of them may discover, the sentiments of the different leg- islatures are extremely fluctuating, and when danger is past and in
 terest has its full operation unchecked by fear, they may be very different from what they are nort
 This n:at'er may also be viewed in a political sense
 The confed- eration is a very imperfect one
 The grand committees of the na- tion are without power, and the individual members may, as they have often done, adopt the little local policy of their respective States
 They may be restricted by express instructions
 If the

1
e for the army can be thrown upon the continent at large, and the army kept together, their hands would be strengthened
 They could speak with some degree of authority to any refractory State, and it might be the happy means of procuring justice to ourselves and others, of making and keeping us a great and respectable people, by securing the na- tional faith and national character
 Without something of this kind, we have the melancholy prospect of having spent our best years, our fortunes, and our blood to no purpose, or to a very bad one, that of becoming the most abject aud despicable people on the face of the earth
 An objection, I know, arises from the dislike some of the States have to the name of a pension
 I can not be- lieve them serious in it, but make use of it only to cover their dis- like to rewarding the men who have made them free—a horrid in- stance of ingratitude, which, though a disgrace to human nature, is unhappily not uncommon
 I have seen it somewhere laid down as a maxim that " kings maj be ungrateful, but republies mu
ft be
" If there is, then, any thing in the nature of a republic that sub- jects it to this vice, so much the more reason have we to guard against its operation
 But what I have proposed above by no means prevents the legis- lature of any State from entering into a compromise with the officers of that State for their half-pay, but it would put the officers in a situation to make the bargain upon more equal terms
 Should a State choose to give them a sum of money instead of half-pay, and they agree to receive it
 what is the consequence? Simply this: a ratio of the payments to be made by that State to the public pro- portionate to what the half-pay list of that State bears to the whole half-pay list, would cease, and that Congress would very easily manage
 Permit me to observe that there is a part of the army which must depend upon Congress solely
 These are the foreign officers, our own brevet officers, and Hazen's aud Armand's corps
 Some lines, particularly that of Connecticut, are also very averse to a depend- ence ujxin their States
 Should the army divide, and some throw themselves upon Congress and some upon their respective States, nothing will be done by either
 Congress will want the power, aud the States, I fear, will want the will
1 1 General StSt. Clair very clearly outlines the views of those who, while suf- fering in the field for eight years, had found dependence upon the States a broken reed, saw that the peace of society and permanency in government

 577 GENERAL WASHINGTON TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 HEADQUARTERS, NEWBURGH, February 1Wi, 1783
 Dear Sir:—It is a considerable time since I received the letter in which you informed me it would be impossible for you to return to the army ut the period appointed, on account of your pecuniary and domestic affairs
 Sympathizing deeply in your private distresses, I have delayed to recall your attention and presence to your com- mand as long as the circumstances of service, my own personal feelings, and the duty I owe to the public, would suffer me to do it
 Before the receipt of this letter, you will have learnt my sentiments respecting the duties that are expected of the general officers of this armv, from a late order transmitted to you officially by the Adjutant-General
 In addition to that information, I now take the liberty, in this private and friendly manner, to acquaint you, that, in case you wish to retain a command in this army, it will be essen- tial for you to come on immediately, prepared to remain with it, as I must make it a point for every officer who will have the honor of commanding any corps of troops in it, to take upon himself the charge and trouble of manenvering, disciplining and forming that corps for the field
 I do not here enter fully into a detail of the reasons which now make it particularly necessary for the general officers, who have been long absent, to join without loss of time
 It will surely be sufficient to mention, that out of nine generals assigned to the com- mand of the troops in this cantonment, seven are either actually gone, or have made applications to be absent at the same time, so that by gratifying their wishes (besides incurring public reprehen- sion) the whole weight of the business, the cares and the troubles of the army, would devolve upon me, until a sunshine occasion, or a prospect of some brilliant operation, should induce them to return and share the pleasures and honors of service
 I request you will be so kind as to give me a line in answer to this, by the very next post
 could only be secured throai;!I one general head
 Hence, Wasbington nnd his associates afti-rwards favored a strong government, while those who did not share in the sufferings and perils, and theorized on political affairs, fa- vored a greater reservation of power to the State

 HON
 JOHN POTTS TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 NEW YORK, January 8M, 1783
 Sir:—It is with no small degree of satisfaction that I am just now informed of your return from the unhealthy climate to the south ward
 Will you pardon me, dear sir, when I sav that I greatly rejoice at your presence in our country at this particular period, as it appears to me very important to the future prosperity and happiness of America
 Whether this country shall, after all its difficulties and distresses, return to the full enjoyment of the blessings of peace, liberty, and safety, or continue to suffer the miseries and hardships of war, will depend on the determination of Congress this winter
 What in- ducement any man who has the interest of this country at heart can have to desire the continuance of this scene of distraction, I can not conceive
 The difficulties of this country in regard to its trade, and in point of resource, are notorious; and although a very uninformed and very retired individual, yet sufficient facts appear to justify my conclusion that America might, at this period, put an end to the calamities of war with the gratification of every reasonable wish
 It is not, nor I am persuaded ever will be, the desire of the gentle- man to whom I have the honor to address this, to make this country the instrument of the exaltation of France, to the destruction of England, even supposing that to be the possible issue, and if that is not the intention, I coufesss I am totally at loss to conceive the mo- tive which can operate to the continuance of the war
 The compass of a letter will not permit me to enlarge, even if I was certain it would be agreeable, but will conclude with requesting, as a very particular favor, that General StSt. Clair would honor me so much as by a line or two to explain where the obstacle lies to prevent the happy return of the blessings of peace
 I am persuaded your liberality of sentiment will pardon this lib- erty, for I beg you to be assured that, whatever my circumstances or situation arc or may be, I shall always retain a sincere and warm affection for my native country and its happiness
 If you will have the goodness to indulge me in this request, and deliver, or have it delivered, to Mrs
 Potts, it Avill safely be con- veyed to me, and lay me under very particular obligation

 679 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO HON
 THOMAS FITZSMMONS
 PHILADELPHIA, January, 21, 1783
 Sir:—The House are well acquainted that another reform of the army has taken place, in consequence whereof, a number of officers of the line of this State retired from the service
 The situation of these men is truly deplorable
 They find themselves, after a length of time that has been entirely devoted to the public, and with very considerable sums due them from it, absolutely destitute of the means t:f subsistence—they can not return to their former employ- ments, their habits are too much changed, and if they had the incli- nation the want of money is an insuperable bar
 From the deten- tion of their pay they have all contracted debts, and their credit' ors are pressing
 As these gentlemen look up to me, for advice at least (other assistance I can not afford them, as I find myself in the same situation), I hope I mav stand excused for taking the liberty to address you on this subject, and requesting that you will bring the matter before the House
 An advance of money is of the utmost consequence even to their existence, and, should it be denied, they mast be driven to desperation
 They will gladly and thankfully re- ceive it as the bounty of the Assembly, but they have claim to it on the strictest principles of justice
 The State has taken upon itself the payment of part of the money due to them and their half- pay
 The promise alone is of no moment, but they must and do expect that some steps be taken to fulfill that promise
 It is needless to multiply words upon a subject that speaks for itself, and I have so much trust in the justice aud humanity of the House, that the matter need only be brought before them to give it its full weight
 Poverty, nakedness, and a jail are not the balm they will pour into their soldier's wounds, yet, if some relief is longer delayed, the retired officers must experience them all, for, to my certain knowledge, many of them can not purchase themselves a pair of shoes or a loaf of bread, after having for seven long years braved every danger, in every climate, to give happiness and ease to their fellow-citizens
 grieved over the unhappy difference between the colonies and the mother country

580 The StSt. Clair Papers
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO THE OFFICERS OF THE PENNSYLVANIA LINK
 POTTSGROVE, March 29, 1783
 Gentlemen 
-—Colonel Robison and Captain Keene have done me the honor to call upon me with the resolve of Congress of the 22d inst
, respecting the commutation of the half-pay fora sum in gross, and to desire my opinion as to what ought to be the conduct of the line with regard to accepting or rejecting it
 I am very free to tell you that I think it ought, by all means, to be accepted, and my reasons are, that it is more favorable'in itself than the half-pay; that the army being joined with the other creditors gives both a better chance of being paid, and that the public security is the proper se- curity, and safer than that of the individual States
 Independent of these, there are other reasons, of apolitical nature, which should induce every person who wishes well to his country to close with the proposal in the above resolve
 A sum in gross equiv- alent to the half-pay, on the principle of annuities, is more favorable to the officers than the half-pay itself, because that sum becomes at once their absolute property, and whether it is paid in money or only certificates granted for it, provided there is a sufficient fund for the regular payment of the interest, and that interest is actually regularly paid, it is the same thing
 The certificates will immedi- ately bec:ime negotiable among ourselves for their full value; among foreigners they will bear a premium, our interest being so much higher than in Europe, that there is not a doubt with me that it wJl only want to be known to see them pressing their monev into our funds
 This will bo a public benefit, but the great advantage to the officers is, that those who have families, instead of a pre- carious provision depending upon their lives, will be able t, trans- mit them the whole, either as an annuitv or a sum to be divided among them, as they may think proper
 To these who have no families, the command of such a sum of money presents the oppor- tunity of entering with advantage into some other way of life
 I think the army being put on the same footing with the other cred- itors an advantage to both, as it promises more effectually to secure payment to both
 The funds for the payment of the interest of the public debts must be provided by the St::tes individually; but they must be irrevocable, and the management of them confined to Congress
 The public creditors, exclusive of the army, are, in most of the States, the body of the people
 Their desires to be paid, though not quite so well-founded, are not less craving than those
Page 581

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 581 of the army
 By joining with them, therefore, we take advan- tage of that disposition and bring it to operate in our favor, for no individual legislature will, or dare, refuse to comply with the requi- sitions of Congress when those requisitions take in the interests of themselves and their constituents; but very differently might they act if the army were offered, as insisted upon, a separate provision
 In the one case, we are sure of a great interest with us
 In the other, it would as certainly be against us
 The sum need give no alarm
 I am pretty well informed that the interest of our whole debt, that to the army inclnded, would very little, if any thing, ex- ceed' six hundred thousand pounds per annum
 There is a variety of sentiment with regard to the security, some preferring that of the individual States, and others that of the Con- tinent
 Xor is it at all surprising that the officers of Pennsylvania should lean towards a State security, for the State acted noblv towards them
 Notwithstanding, I am most decidedly of opinion that we ought to look up to the Continent only, and heartily wish the army may be unanimously of that opinion
 Much, I think, de- pends on it
 In the first place, while we have no legal claim upon the States, it is t'ac Continent our services have been given to, and it is the faith of the Continent that is pledged for a retribution
 True, the Assembly of Pennsylvania did take up the half-pay, and have promised it shall be paid, but not a step has been token fur- ther in the business, nor is it clear that they could ever provide funds for the purpose
 The complexion of the House may change very much
 Danger is now at a distance, and the infamy that attends ungenerous actions is, in public bodies, divided among so many that none seem to feel any part of it, so that little reliance is to be placed upon their honor
 They may haggle at the commutation, and examples of rejecting the half-pay are sure to be set them
 They can not take in the public creditors along with us without burdening the State far be- ycnd her proportion, and, of consequence, we shall have all their weight against us
 But if none of this should happen, it will still depend upon the will and pleasure of some future Assembly
 The half-pay, or the interest of the commutation, may be paid regularly for some time
 We arc disbanded and dispersed, and no longer in any way formidable

 tional faith and national character which must ever operate strongly upon that body, while it is very little felt by individual Legis- latures
 The reasons of a political nature that strike me most forcibly are, that, by joining with the public creditors we should strengthen the hands of Congress
 We should give their recommendations for the establishment of public credit almost absolute certainty of being complied with, and a new chain of umon would be formed among the States of more consequence, and that would hold them more firmly together than our boasted confederation
 On the whole, gentlemen, I am very clear that you should not hesitate about the acceptance of the commutation on the footing of the resolve of Congress
 If you think with me, or if you think otherwise, your determination should, as soon as it is obtained, be sent to General Washington
 At the same time, you should send to Carolina an account of what you have determined upon, that General Greene may transmit the sentiments of that part of the line under his command in due time
 Congress has directed the sentiments to be taken by lines; in our case, it is impossible, from local situation, part being under the immediate command of Gen- eral Washington and part under that of General Greene
1 GENERAL IRVINE TO GENERAL STSt. Clair
 CARLISLE, April 17, 1783
 Dear General:—On the question of the day, viz: half-pay, com- mutation, and, I fear, or nothing, might be added, how is the sense of our line to be collected? I think the sooner some steps are taken the better, particularly as I am much afraid even the small powers Congress at present possesses will daily dwindle
 There appears an evident disposition in several States already to curtail them, and this will become general
 If this is a fact, what value will a resolu- tion of Congress be of, unless the States, severally, confirm them by laws, which I conceive they will scarce think of with respect to the army after their dissolution; for it seems that all public bodies will not think of doing or enacting any thing unless they are petitioned for the express purpose
 How will the army, then, once disbanded, be ever able even to ask justice; collectively and individually to hope 1 For further correspondence on this suhject, see letters of StSt. Clair and Irvine, followmg

 583 to obtain it would be vain indeed
 The eastern, or main army, gives the tone
 Do you think they are really satisfied with the late resolution, and will they retire resting the matter as it now stands? Whatever they do, the rest must follow their example; but are not their States disposed to do them justice? I think they are con- vinced of this or they would not give up the point so easy
 Would not a correspondence with them be necessary? They ought at least, I think, to Ire felt, and I think you could do this without coming to any explanation; much depends on the conducting matters at this juncture
 I do not yet know whether I must return to Fort Pitt or not; but it is mosfr probable I must, as I am informed, by express yesterday, that the savages are killing and scalping all over the country
 These wretches, I think, must be extirpated
 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL IRVFNE
 PHILADELPHIA, May 6,1783
 Dear Sir:—Your favor of the 16th of last month was delivered to me about three days ago, and I am happy to have an opportunity so soon to answer it, as I am one letter in your debt, and have, at other times, been very tardy in replying; but I entreat you to be- lieve it has not arisen from any neglect, but solely from a bad habit I have contracted of never having a letter ready for a conveyance, and very often, when the conveyance offers, it is impossible to write
 I have, however, for some time past been so afflicted with the gout that I really had neither ability nor inclination to write a line to any living creature
 I am now getting over it, and though I know you would have sympathized with me in any case, it was with no small degree of concern I learned that you have been confined almost all winter with its cousin german
 As to the question of the half-pay commutation, I strongly recom- mended to our line that they should accept it agreeably to the resolve of Congress, but not relinquishing the promise of the State in case the States at large did not provide the necessary funds; and that they should unite with all the public creditors of every denomina- tion
 This, I thought, would interest a great number of people in each State whose weight would probably be exerted, in the different Legislatures, against the army if they insisted on separate and dis- tinct provision; that they should send on their determination to that part of the line to the southward for their concurrence, and, in the meantime, signify what they resolved upon to General Wash-

584 The StSt. Clair Papers
 ington within the last two months; but I have been so indisposed that I have not had opportunity to inquire what they have done, and they have not thought proper to inform me
 You justly ob- serve the eastern troops will give the tone, and it was certainly in their power to have, without taking any improper or indecent measures, induced a compliance with our reasonable demands; but they have, I believe, been wretchedly managed, and the opportunity is, I fear, escaped forever; I believe thev will disband
 They will be themselves the greatest sufferers, for I am persuaded, after they have mixed with the mass of the people, no manner of regard will be paid to their claims, their services or their merits
 Indeed, it pre- sents a very gloomy prospect to us nil, but I have still some confi- dence in the honor and generosity of this State; but bad examples are very catching, and, God knows, we have many, even in our House of Assembly, who are not possessed of the most liberal senti- ments
 The mode you mention in your letter was, in a great meas- ure, pursued; a committee came here from the army, and, after hanging on Congress for a considerable time, and having obtained as satisfactory an account of what was to be expected as could be got, one of them was sent to the army to acquaint them with it; but no good effect has been produced, and, indeed, fur myself, I never expected much, for I know the officers from that country look so much to the civil line of life, and are so fond of either gaining popularity among the citizens, or preserving what they have al- ready, that no measure that would put that to a risk had much chance of going cordially down with them
 A very little time now will bring us to the tie plus ultra; yet still I flatter myself that, if we can but be unanimous among ourselves, we shall get justice done us by our own State
 Our situation is, however, critical, and requires both vigorous and prndent measures; if we fail, we shall be the more wretched part of the community, with the constant mortification before us of seeing every body else in ease and plenty at our expense
 I must bid you farewell, for the subject has made me, as it always does whenever I think of it, very gloomy

 Dear Sir:-—Dr
 Rogers has been applying for leave that his son, who is surgeou at Fort Pitt, might come to this place
 His in- tention is to send him from hence to Europe, in order to finish his education in the profession previous to his settling for life
 I re- ferred him to you, as you were the proper judge whether his pres- ence could be dispensed with, and the only person that could dispense with it; at the same time, I informed him I had no doubt you would comply with his request, for such a purpose especially, it' it could possibly be done
 The definitive treaty is not yet arrived; nevertheless, the army is about to be dissolved—not indeed actually disbanded, but what is the wiiue thing
 All those engaged for the war are to be furloughed until that time, and then discharged
 What is to become of your post I know not, ui>r, I believe, did Congress ever consider that your command was composed entirely of men under the above description
 I presume, however, they will either be continued until possession is taken of the posts upon the lakesor that they will be relieved by some of those who stand engaged for three years, of whom, I suppose, there will be near five thousand

 Dear Sir:—The affair we lately conversed upon is likely to suffer for want of proper application
 Gentlemen say they are not informed what the sentiments of the officers of our line are
 There is to be a conference with n committee to-morrow
 This may be of some use; but I most earnestly wish that n short memorial on thu subject of paying the commutation and arrears, both which will amount, perhaps to a million of dollars, according to the computations that have been com- municated to me, in lands
 Wo have it now in our power to do justice to the officers and soldiers, and to provide comfortably for them; and, happily for us, the same measure will render essential service to the Slate, and demonstrate the truths of the old saying that "Honesty is the hest policy
" It any mistake is made at this time, it will be impossible to compensate for it by any future acts
 I, there- fore, beg leave lo call for your assistance, in order that this very important business muy be brought to a desirable conclusion

 GENERAL STSt. Clair TO GENERAL WAYNE
 PHILADELPHIA, June 15tfi, 1783
 Sir:—I have written to you by this conveyance, informing you that the troops under your command are to be landed at Wilming- ton and marched to Lancaster
 I think it necessary to inform you of the reasons that induced such directions to be given
 It was found to be next to impossible to keep together the men engaged for the war, who composed much the greatest part of the main army after the proclamation of an indefinite cessation of hostilities, at the same time there was a great and striking indecorum in our disarm- ing entirely, until the articles of the provisional treaty were carried into execution
 This induced Congress to adopt the expedient of allowing as many of them as chose to go home upon furlough, and to be discharged upon the ratification of the definite treaty
 The whole, I believe, accepted the furlough, those excepted of the Penn- sylvania line in this State, so that the men engaged for a time other than the duration of the war are all that now compose the army
 The entire derangement of our finances put it out of the power of the public to make the provision they wished, and that ought to have been made before a dissolution of the army took plaec, which you will see this expedient of the furloughs really amounts to
 But the regiments at this place have refused to accept of furloughs, and have shown a disposition that has justly given some alarm to the citizens
 Their numbers are too inconsiderable, it is certain, to be formidable, yet, nevertheless, should they break out into any ex- cesses, they might do infinite mischief, and should the troops from Carolina, who can not reasonably be expected to be in very good temper, be joined to them, the same, spirit would instantly run through the whole, and the evil become more extensive
 I am per- suaded you will think it necessary they should be kept separate, and take such measures for those under your immediate command being marched to the place assigned them, as will be the most proper, both to keep them in temper, and tend to the safety and quiet of the citizens
1 1 The situation was thought to be so critical that General St
 ('lair, hy order of General Lincoln, Secretary of War, dispatched Captain Talbot to the bay with orders ID the pilots not to proceed up the Delaware beyond "Wilmington, where the troops were to debark, and then march to Lancaster
 General Lincoln had expressed the opinion that treat consideration should be shown to the soldiers on account of the "peculiar distress in which they are involved

 My Dear General:—The inclosed note2 was this moment delivered to me by the messenger of Congress
 The pressing manner in which the President writes will not per- mit me to give you a detail of the circumstances which require your presence
 The troops at Lancaster have mutinied, and are now on their march to this city

—The President of Congress1 presents his compliments to the Assistant Secretary of War, and informs him that it is orde
ed by Congress that he do immediately send an express to Major-General StSt. Clair, directing him to repair to this city without delay
 The Assistant Secretary will not communicate this measure to any person whatever
 1 Elins lioudmot was President of Congress
 On the fourteenth of June, the Secretary of Wnr had instructed General StSt. Clair as follows: •' Should any of the men now at Lancaster decline receiving their fur- loughs, you will please to form them in complete corps and cause them to be marched to the barracks in Carlisle
 The requisite orders were sent to Colonel Hampton, who was in command there
 The soldiers who were recent recruits de- manded nn immediate settlement, and, upon this being refused (there was nobody with authority to make such settlement), marched in force for Philadelphia, with the view of compelling compliance from Congress
 Arrived at Philadelphia, they were joined by some of the soldiers stationed there, and three hundred strong marched to the State-House, where both Congress and the Council of Pennsylvania were sitting, which they surrounded
 They then demanded, in writing, juf Council, that power be granted them to choose officers to lead them, and authority to take such measures as they thought proper to redress their grievances, and gave Council twenty minutes to consider of it, or abide the consequences
 General StSt. Clair was sent by Congress with unlimited powers to try
 In conjunc- tion with Council, to quiet them, and, if possible, to get them to return to their bar- racks
 He at last prevailed OH them to choose a committee to confer with Council, which was agreed to: but they could not agree among themselves upon the men; and the contention was so warm that one of the sergeants marched off a part of the men, and the rest followed without doing any damage, contrary to my expectation: for I assure you it was n serious affair, for above one-half of them was drunk
 They kept us about three hours, and we had no military force to suppress them
 Congress was so offended at the insult offered to the majesty and sovereignty of the United States, that they adjourned next day to Princeton, and have not returned since
 Whether they will return is not yet known, but they have ordered down two or three regiments of Connecticut troops, which are now on their way here
 On the Wednesday following, the soldiers laid down their arms and surrendered to their officers, and made submission to us
 They have taken furloughs, and are almost all gone

 CI,ATR to GENERAL "\\TASHINGTOX
 PRINCETON, July 2, 1783
 Sir:—The unfortunate and disgraceful event that has lately hap- pened in Philadelphia must have occasioned your Excellency much uneasiness, and you ought to have received an account of it from me, but I was prevented from giving it by the very ill state of my health, and the total uselessuess of my right hand, from a violent relapse into the gout, which, indeed, I have not been one day free from since the second of March
 It will be useless now to enter into that detail, as you must have received it through Congress and the War Office, but I am happy to be able to inform you that the affair is over, and the troops returned to their obedience
 From what yet appears, a Captain Carberry, a deranged officer, and Lieutenant Sullivan, of Moylan's dragoons, were the principal instigators of the mutiny; they have absconded, and I believe did get on board a vessel at Chester that was ready to pail for London
 There is reason to think that some other officers, and most of the sergeants, certainly, were concerned in it
 Three officers I left in arrest, and ordered the sergeants who appeared to be ring-leaders to be confined as soon as an examination, which the Chief-Justice was directed to make in order to discover whether they had not been prompted by some of the citizens, should be over
 In these I was happy to find I hud anticipated the wishes of Congress, and every thing in my power, either directly or in aid of General Howe, to detect and bring to condign punishment the authors and abettors, [ am led to do so by every motive of duty and inclination
 Your Excellency will have seen in Oswald's paper, of Saturday last, a very strange account of the matter, together with a most illiberal attack upon Congress,1 and in which I am also placed in no very favorable 1 Party feeling was brought into this mutter, mid a wide difference between Congress and the Council of Pennsylvania was developed
 The former body appointed a committee, consisting of Alexander Hamilton, Colonel Pickering, and Sir
 Ellsworth, to confer with the State authorities as to the best mode for rebuking the insult offered to tha legislative bodies
 The committee advised calling out the State militia and disarming tho mutineers by force
 This the council refused, and resorted to a temporizing policy
 Thereupon, Congress withdrew to Princeton, whence they sent for General StSt. Clair to confer, and orders were given to General Howe to put two regi- ments in readiness for marching to Philadelphia
 The matter was adjusted, as indicated in StSt. Clair's letter to Washington
 Tho officers condemned were afterwards pardoned by the State legislature
 For a statement of
Page 589

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 589 point of view
 I flatter myself that your Excellency knows me well enough to believe that no improper concessions would easily bo drawn from me en any occasion
 On this, no promise of any kind was made tho s
,Idicry, but that their accounts should be settled, and they put on the same footing as the rest of the army
 They re- quested that they might be permitted to appoint a committee of three or more officers, either now on actual service or that had been, to confer with the executive of the State; to this, with the approbation of Congress and Council, I consented, and got them sent to their quarters, and, indeed, without vanity, I believe it was fortunate that I was able to come to town, aa my presence had some effect in restraining them from greater enormities
 The troops under the command of General Howe, I met yester- day near Trenton, and this day they were to proceed on their march for Philadelphia
 I gave him every necessary information, and, as I shall return in a day or two, will give him every assistance; in the meantime, if the Jndge-Advocate can be spared from the armv, I could wish your Excellency to order him down, both because there may be many officers to try upon a very delicate point, and that the State may be somehow involved in the issue of the inquiry, it there- fore seems to me it would be best it should be conducted by the proper officer, and with more attention to form than might happen if it was done by an officer appointed for the occasion
 The charges I have exhibited against the officers are: suspicion of being concerned with Captain Carberry and Lientenant Sullivan, who have absconded, in exciting the late mutiny among the troops, or aiding and abetting the same; and against Captain Chrystie, who happened to be the eldest officer in the committee, and acted as their chairman, behaving unlike an officer in refusing to communi- cate, as chairman of tho committee, to me what proposals t!:e troops had made of returning to their duty, or whether they had made any
 This charge lies equally against the whole, but, in the first instance, can be brought forward against him only
 It would be too tedious to give your Excellency the particulars on which this last charge is founded, but the committee has promised that they will make no representations on the part of the soldiery until they had made proper submission to Congress and to the SLate for their be- havior on the 21st; and it was the refusal of that communication which induced the committee of Congress to advise the adjournment both parties to the controversy, the reader is referred to the Works of Alex- ander Hamilton, Vol

 General Washington did me the honor to read the papers I showed to him, and his Excel- lency told me, on returning them, that he must confess "he could not
 see upon what principle of justice Congress had acted respecting my rank
" I have, however, said nothing to that great body on the subject

 I have now the honor to inclose the proceedings of the convention since that time, by which you 10th May, 178", they converted the name of the Roman dictator into a Latin plural—Cincinnati—tmd adopted it
 The Institution of the Order was drawn up by a committee consisting of Generals Knox, Hand and Hunt- ington, and Captain Shaw, of General Knox's staff, who aeted as secretary
 On the 1 oth May, the representatives of the army met nt the quarters of Baron deSteubi n (who presided on the occasion), and formally accepted and approved the Institution
 "The fundamental articles upon which it was based are these: An in- cessant attention to preserve inviolate those exalted rights and
 liberties of human nature for which they had fought and bled, and without which the high rank of a rational being is a curse instead of blessing
 •' An unalterable determination to promote and cherish between the re- spective States, that union and National honor so essentially necessary to their happiness and the future dignity of the American Empire
 "To render permanent the cordial affection subsisting among the officers
" Besides this, the Society was to be eleemosynary—each officer contrib- uting one month's pay towards the creation of a fund for the support of in- digent widows and orphans

 I am perfectly convinced that, if the institution of this Society had not been parted with, ere this we should have had the country in an uproar, and a line of separation drawn between this Society and their fellow-citizens
 The alterations which took place at the last general meeting have quieted the clamors which in many of the States were rising to a great height; but I have not heard yet of the incorporation of any Society by the State to which it belongs, which is an evidence, in my mind, that the jealousies of the people are rather asleep than removed on this occasion
 I am always made happy when I hear that any of my fellow- laborers have received appointments, that may in some measure compensate them for their past services and losses in the late revo- lution
 I feel it in two respects; first, as it benefits the individual; and next, as it is a testimony of public gratitnde
 Be assured, then, my dear sir, that your appointment to the office which you now hold gave me much pleasure, as I am told the emoluments of it are handsome

 SUGGESTIONS FOR A PLAN OF GOVERNMENT
l The-Committee of the Council of Censors, to whom it was re- ferred to report those articles of the Constitution which are de- 1Tho Constitution of Pennsylvania formed in 1776, provided that, " In order thut the freedom of this commonwealth may be preserved inviolate forever, there shall be chosen, by ballot, by the freemen in each eitv and county respectively, on the second Tuesday in October, in the year 1783, and on the second Tuesday in October in every seventh year thereafter, two persons in each city and county of this State, to be called the Council of Censors, who shall meet together on the second Monday of November next ensuing their election; the majoritv of whom shall be a quorum, in every case, except as to calling a convention, in which two thirds of the whole number shall agree, and whose duty it shall bo to inquire whether the Con- stitution has been preserved inviolate in every part, and whether the legis- lative and executive branches of Government have performed their duty as guardians of the people, or assumed to themselves or exercised other or greater powers than they are entitled to by the Constitution; thev are also to inquire whether the public taxes have been justly laid and collected, etc

 fective and suggest alterations and amendments, reported January 19, 1784: That, by the Constitution of the State of Pennsylvania, the su- preme legislative power is vested in one House of Representatives, chosen by all those who pay public taxes
 Your committee humbly conceive the said Constitution to be, in this respect, materially de- fective: 1
 Because, if it should happen that a prevailing faction in that one house was desirous of enacting unjust and tyrannical laws, there is no check upon their proceedings
 2
 Because au uncontrolled power of legislation will always ena- ble the body possessing it to usurp both the judicial aud the execu- tive authority, in which case no remedy would remain to the people but by a revolution
 That, by the said Constitution the supreme executive poweris dele- gated to a council
2 Your committee conceive the said Constitution to be in this respect materially defective: cle of the Constitution which may be defective, explaining such as may be thought not clearly expressed, and ol' adding such as are necessary for the preservation of the rights and happiness of the people; but the articles to be amended, and the amendments proposed, and such articles as are proposed to be added or abolished, shall be promulgated at least six months before the day appointed for the election of such convention, for the previous consid- eration of the people, that they may have an opportunity of instructing their delegates on the subject
' To this Council of Censors Arthur StSt. Clair was elected in October, 1783, from the county of Philadelphia
 He was made a member of the commit- tee appointed "to report those articles of the Constitution which are mate- rially defective, and absolutely require alteration and amendment
" The members chosen wero: Samuel Miles, Thomas Fitzsimmons, Arthur StSt. Clair, Thomas Hartley and John Arndt
 The report was drafted princi- pally by General StSt. Clair, and the essential parts, which have been found in his handwriting, have been included in this work for the purpose of exhib- iting his views of the principles of constitutional government
 Although the report was sustained by a majority, it lacked the requisite two-thirds, and a new convention was not called at that time
 2 An executive council is a monster
 It may do great harm, and never can do any good—it will ever want that energy and promptness that are essential to an executive body, for it is not executive but deliberative
 It destroys all responsibility, and is a very useless expense
 If the President has abilities, the council are but the solemn witnesses of his acts; if he is ambitious at the same time, they will be found to be his useful instruments; if he is cruel or revengeful, at onco his ready tools and a defense behind which he at any time can shelter himself; if rapacious, they will share with him in the plunder of their country, I wish, for the honor of human na-

 Because the constant sitting of a council is expensive and bur- densome
 2
 Because a numerous body of men, though possessed of wis- dom necessary for deliberation, will never possess the decision nec- essary for action on sudden emergencies
 3
 Because, where a Council act either weakly or wickedly, there is no individual so accountable to the public as every man ought to be in such cases
 4
 Because a single man would never be able of himself to do such acts as he may persuade a majority of his Council to concur in and support by their numbers
 5
 Because, the election of the President being by joint ballot of the Council and Assembly, if a prevailing faction should ever happen in the assembly so as to lead a considerable majority, the President thus chosen will have nothing to fear from the Legislature, and, by influencing the Council, will possess exorbitant authority, without being properly accountable for the exercise of it
 That by the said Constitution the judges of the Supreme Court are to be commissioned for seven years only, and are removable (for misbehavior) at any time, by the General Assembly
 Your com- mittee conceive the said Constitution to be, in this respect mate- rially defective: 1
 Not only because the lives and property of the citizens must, in a great degree depend upon the judges, but the liberties of the State are evidently connected with their independence
 2
 Because, if the Assembly should pass an unconstitutional law, and the judges have virtue enough to refuse to obey it, the same Assemblv could instantly remove them
 3
 Because, at the close of seven years the seats of the judges must depend on the will of the Council; wherefore, the judges will naturally be under an undue bias, in favor of those upon whose will their commissions arc to depend
 That great care is taken by the said constitution to establish a ro- tation in sundry offices, which your committee humbly conceive to be improvident: ture, no such combination could ever bo found; but we know they have ex- isted together in other countries—they may exist together in this
 All the dangers of an inconvenient aristocracy are justly to be dreaded from such a body as our present Council
 The rotation of its members is no security
 Our Assembly will soon degenerate into an oligarchy, and the wretched people be destroyed by it

 1
 Because the hope of reappointment to office is amongst the strongest incentives to the due execution of the trust it confers
 2
 Because the State is thereby necessarily deprived of the serv- ice of useful men for a time, and compelled to make experiment of others who may not prove equally wise and virtuous
 3
 Because the check intended hy such principle of rotation can be of no good effect to repress inordinate ambition, unless it were extended so as to preclnde a man from holding any office whatever
 4
 Because the privilege of the people in elections is so far in- fringed as they are thereby deprived of the right of choosing those persons whom they would prefer
 [Having thus pointed out the defects of the Constitution, the committee proceeded to elaborate the principles indicated by setting up new articles more in the spirit of republican government
 In this I shall not follow the completed report, as submitted to the Council of Censors, but such parts as I find among the StSt. Clair Papers which were the originals of the report
] To the end that the laws may be more maturely considered, and the blessings of free and equal government extended and secured to the good people of this State, the supreme legislative power shall be vested in two separate and distinct bodies of men: The one to be called the Legislative Council or Senate; the other to be called the House of Assembly; who shall meet once, at least, in every year, for the dispatch of public business, and shall be stvled The General Assembly of Pennsylvania
 The Senate shall consist of members from each county in this State, chosen annually from amongst the body of the freeholders at the time and place directed by law for the election of members of Assembly, and shall respectively be possessed of an unincumbered estate of the value of pounds
 All bills framed in the House of Assembly shall be sent to them for their consideration, and, if concurred in by a majority, they shall be sent back to the Assembly, and shall become, when signed by the Speaker, the laws of the land, but they shall have a negative upon every bill of what kind soever, for the use of which they may assign their reasons to the Assembly, or otherwise, at their pleasure, and no bill shall pass into a law without their consent
 The Legislative Council shall have power to appoint a President, who shall have a casting voice in all debates in that body, but no other vote; and, in case of the absence, death, or resignation of the Governor, he shall administer the Government, and have and exercise, for the time being, all the powers and privileges of the Governor

 597 The House of Assembly shall consist of persons most noted for wisdom and virtue, to be chosen by the freemen of every city and county therein respectively
 (The people of every county ought to be constitutionally at lib- erty to choose representatives from any part of the State
 It is confining the idea of representation too much, and the people have the undoubted right to jndge who will best serve them and the pub- lic at large, and to elect them whether they are residents of the re- spective county Or not
) The members of the House of Assembly shall be chosen annu- ally, by ballot, on the second Tuesday of October, forever, and shall meet on the fourth Monday of the same month
 All money bills shall originate in the House of Assembly only, and may be altered, amended, or rejected by the Legislative Coun- cil
 All other bills and ordinances may take rise in the House of Assembly or Legislative Council, and may be altered, amended, or rejected by either
 They shall sit on their own adjournments, but neither body shall have power to adjourn themselves for longer time than two days, without mutual consent
 They shall jndge of the elections and qualifications of their own members; they mav ex- pel a member, but not twice for the same cause; they may admin- ister oaths on examination of witnesses, and have all other powers necessary for a free and independent branch of the Legislature
 No reasons against a law ought to appear upon the minutes
 If the bill passes by a majority of one only, it is as binding and an equal obedience is due to it as if it had passed with unanimous consent
 A dissent with reasons on the minutes can answer no end but to foment party disputes, and weaken the force of the law, and impede its execution
 But the happiness of a State is so inti- mately combined with a vigorous execution of and prompt obedi- ence to the laws, that, where these are wanting, anarchy must en- sue
 If the laws are found imperfect or oppressive, they should be amended or repealed
 The privilege of entering the yeas and nays is all that any member should desire, and is as much as is consistent with order and good government
 There shall be a Governor, to whom shall be intrusted the execu- tion of the laws and the appointment of all officers, civil and mili- tary, the officers of both Houses of the Legislature excepted, who shall be appointed by each House respectively
 The Governor shall be chosen annually by the freemen of the State, qualified as is required to entitle persons to vote for members of the House of Assembly, at the same time and place or places
 He shall be, in

 virtue of his office, Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the State, but shall not have power to march the militia beyond the bounda- ries of the State without the consent of the Legislature
 He shall have power to convene the General Assembly oil extraordinary oc- casions, and to pardon, to mitigate punishment, or reprieve persons convicted of crime
*, other than those that may be convicted on im- peachment or of treason
 It shall be his duty to lay before the General Assembly, at every session, a statement of the condition of public affairs, and call attention to such business as may re- quire legislative consideration
 All bills shall be presented to him for his approval; but if he objects to the passing of such bill, he shall return it, together with his objections, to the House in which it originated
 The Judges of the Supreme Court, and of the Courts of Com- mon Pleas, shall be appointed by the Governor, and hold their offices during good behavior
1 They shall be incapable of holding any other office
 A court shall be appointed for the trial of impeachment, and shall consist of members of the Assembly and Legislative Council, to be chosen by ballot
 1 They should hold their offices during good behavior
 Nothing is of more importaLce to the people than the able and impartial administration of jus- tice; but that can not happen unless the judges are taken from the bar
 To acquire any eminence in the profession of the law, requires a long and la- borious preparation—after much toil and study the road to case and import- ance opens by degrees, and an assiduous application to busii^ess seldom fails to obtain them
 Will any man who is in that train quit it for the precarious enjoyment of an office which must determine in seven years—where, though he may be re-elected, ho baa no certainty of it? Indeed, the only certainty he can derive arises, not from a steady unbiased execution of the office, but from an interested and variable attention to tho fluctuations of parties and party polities
—Nufr
 by Arthur StSt. Clair
 The following observation on juries, in connection with courts, has also been found: The trial by jury is an inestimable privilege, yet there is something very absurd in the construction of juries as they now stand
 A man must either be starved or damned if ho happens not to bo able to think as some others do
 Let the juries consist of twenty-five, and the verdict be given by a majority, then no man can be convicted or acquitted, but by the unanimous voice of at least thirteen of his fellow-citizens,—Arthur StSt. Clair
 The report of tho committee led to a prolonged debate, in which StSt. Clair participated
 Parts of several speeches are preserved, but theyi

 599 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO JOHN DICKINSON
1 PHILADELPHIA, July I6th, 1785
 Sir:—Having heard that the agents for forfeited estates for the County of Westmoreland are about to sell the buildings in Fort Pitt as the property of Alexander Ross, an attainted traitor, per- mit me to inform you that 110 part of the buildings which were left standing in that fort at its evacuation by the British ever were Mr
 Ross's property
 A part of them belongs to me by grant from Gen- eral (Jage, and part to other jn;ople, and some buildings have been erected therein since it has been occupies! by the United States
 The ruins, which consisted of the materials of a very good house, that was pulled down; the revetment of rampart and parapet—a squarred log redoubt, and a number of pickets or palisades were purchased by Mr
 Ross and the late General Thompson, for, I think, the sum of fifteen or eighteen pounds; but, during the residence of the one and the life of the other, no claim was set up to the build- ings that were on foot
 The disposing of the houses by the agents may embarrass the owners as well as the purchasers, and, for my part, I am not inclined to sell mine at all
 Should Council desire it, I will wait upon them to give fuller information, and, in the mean- time, have to request that the sale may be ordered to be postponed
2 PRESIDENT STSt. Clair TO JAMES MONROE
 NEW YORK, August 20th, 1786
 Dear Sir:—I have been favored with your letter of yesterday,2 and thank you for the communications it contains, upon which I will truly give you my sentiments
 A treaty with Spain I consider 1 President of the Stnto of Pennsylvania
 2 Which request was complied with
 The facts are more fully stated in a letter to John Penn
 See appendix
 2The letter of Jlr
 Monroe is missing, but his opinions as to the proposed treaty with Spain were diametrically opposi d to those expressed by StSt. Clair in the above letter,and in that respect he represented nut only Virginia, but four other Southern States
 The oiher Virginia members, excepting Henry Lee, held the same views
 Briefly stated, the situation was this: Spain, in 1785, appointed Don Diego Gardoqui, Eacargardo dc Krgocios, as representative of that Court in this country
 The rank was not high, but it was utatime when the new Republic was grateful for any kind of recngnition
 John Jay, Secretary of Congress for Foreign Affairs, was commissioned to negoti-
Page 600

600 The StSt. Clair Papers
 as very important to America, at the same time it is certainly our ate with Gardoqui a commercial treaty
 The original instructions were re- pealed by Congress, and new ones substituted, whii
h required him to stipu- late the right of the United States to their territorial bounds, and the free navigation of the Mississippi from its source to the Gulf
 This latter stipu- lation proved 1111 insurmountable barrier to the progress of the negotiation
 It was a point that Spain would not yield, and could not be enforced except by war
 After months spent in fruitless correspondence, Mr
 Jay requested that the instructions be modified, and recommended a compromise, by the proposal of a treaty in which for an equivalent of commercial advantages to the United States, they, without renouncing the right to the navigation to the Mississippi, should agree to forbear the exercise of that right for a terra of years, to which the duration of the treaty should be limited
 Upon this proposition a debate sprung up in Congress which brought to the front the sharp differences that had been developed during the Revolu- tionary war between the Northern and Southern States
 Mr
 Rufus King, of Massachusetts, was especially active in supporting the proposed com- promise, and 1 timl that StSt. Clair, on behalf of Pennsylvania, joined in the debate with great zeal
 Memoranda of a speech now before me, show that in his remarks on the floor of Congress, he went even further than he has in the letter above to Mr
 Monroe
 He remarked that the fact that the United Stales would be prevented, by force, from navigating the Mississippi, and that it was not then necessary to them, were reasons why they should con- sent to forbear the navigation
 It was certainly better policy to waive the exercise of a right which they could not maintain and obtain something for the waiver, than by pertinaciously insisting upon it, lose the advantage and endanger the right of it
 Whereas, if Spain should accept the waiver, the right of the United States would be established for the future, when they should be better able to maintain it
 What was proposed to Spain was a commercial treaty, not an alliance
 The importance to the United States, in the present urgency, for extending business relations and restoring a sound financial basis, would be better un- derstood when it was known that she would take the American products, and pay in the precious metals
 He attributed the anxiety of Spain to form this relation to America, to her desire to strike a blow at Britain by helping to create a new maritime power
 If the opportunity offered should be rejected, then the United Slates would again be placed at the mercy of Great Britain
 Two months after the date ol StSt. Clair s letter to Mr
 
Monroe, Henry Lee wrote to General Washington on the same subject
 He stood alone in the Virginia delegation in support of Mr
 Jay, and he believed that his old com- mander held to the same opinions
 In that letter he said: "The Kastern States consider a commercial connection with Spain as the only remedy for the distresses which oppress their citizens, most of which, they say, flow from the decay of their commerce
 Their delegates have, consequently, zealously pressed the formation of this connection, as the only effectual mode to revive the trade of their country
 In this opinion they have been joined by two of the Middle States
 On the other hand, Virginia has, with equal zeal, op- posed the connection, because the project involves expressly the disuse of the

Correspondence, Addresses, Etc
 601 duty to endeavor to obtain it upon the best terms possible, indeed, if it was possible to give up nothing to procure it; but I believe that can not be done, for, it seems, as I have been informed, that Spain, notwithstanding she is desirous of being in amity with us, has directed her Minister to stipulate as the price of her friendship an acknowledgment on our part of her right to navigate, exclusively, the Mississippi River
 The Minister of the United States is directed to insist in their behalf on the right of navigating that river freely with Spain
 It is obvious that without one or the other party reced- ing in part, the business is at an end
 The question then is: Is the friendship of Spain worth any concessions in respect to that river? I think it is
 Mr
 Jay suggests that forbearing to use for a limited time the right we pretend to have to that navigation, which would be a concession on our part, might enable him to proceed on the business in which he can not advance one step under present cir- cumstances
 In this view, I am clearly of opinion that the restric- tive clause of his instructions ought to be repealed, but as Mr
 Grayson's proposition is more favorable to the Union than the abso- lute forbearing to navigate for a given time, how short soever, I think it ought to have ft trial, and, therefore, I wish to make it an instruction to Mr
 Jay, but by no means an ultimatum
 As to taking the negotiations out of the hands of Mr
 Jay and committing it to our Minister in Europe, I can not think it advisable
 navigation of the Mississippi for a given time, and eventually, they think, will sacrifice our right to it
 The delegation is under instructions from the State on this subiect
 They have acted in obedience to their instructions, and, myself exempted, in conformity to their private sentiments, i confess that I am by no means convinced of the justice or policy of our instructions, and very much apprehend, unless they are repealed by the present Assembly, the fatal effects of discord in council will be experienced by the United States in n very high degree
" In his reply, General Washington said: "My sentiments with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi are known to you
 They are controverted by only one consideration of weight, and that is, the operation which the occlusion of it may nave on the minds of the Western settlers, who will not consider the subject in a relative point of view or on a comprehensive scale, and may be influenced by the demagogues of the country to acts of extrav- agance and desperation, under the popular declamation that their interests are sacrificed
" Washington's prediction was verified some years later, when he was Presi- dent, and StSt. Clair was Governor of the North-western Territory, in the commotion in the West on account of tho exclusive jurisdiction of Spain over tho Mississippi
 At this session, as only seven States voted forthecom- promise proposed by Mr
 Jay, when nine were requisite, tho treaty failed

602 The StSt. Clair Papers
 So far from being acceptable to the court of Madrid, it strikes me that it would be offensive, and if it would be at all necessary that Mr
 Gardoqui should be attended to, it would be impossible; for the investing of Mr
 Jefferson, or any other person, with the character of an Envoy Extraordinary, and sending him to Madrid, would virtually sunersede Gardrqui
 It appears to me we could not possibly tako a more effectual step to defeat the measure, which, in the light in which it presents itself to my mind, I think would be a real misfortune to our country
 Indeed, I do not think there is an- other commercial nation in the world but would feel gratified in hav- ing Spain come forward in the manner she has done to us; nor one that would not be pleased at seeing the opportunity slip through our fingers
 Consider, my dear sir, that Spain has, in some measure, committed herself, without waiting until we should desire her friend- ship
 She has offered it without requesting us to send to Madrid to negotiate the terms; and all nations consider it important to have negotiations carried on under their own eyes, as it gives them a larger influence in them, and the opportunity of improving every circumstance that offers
 She has sent her Minister to negotiate a treaty here
 It is evident the friendship of the United States is valued highly, or a step so uncommon from so haughty a Court would not have been taken
 And what reason can we suggest for desiring to put the negotiations in a train that other nations would stndiously avoid? I can see no good ones, but I can see two that will very readily present themselves to the Spanish Minister: One, that Mr
 Gardoqui is not acceptable, and we will not do business with him; another, that delay is all we have in view until we can feel the pulses of other Courts, and put ourselves in a situation to assert by force that which we claim and they dispute
 The first certainly makes an enemy of Gardoqui, and all his in- terest with the Spanish Ministry, be it much or little, will be ex- erted unfavorably for America
 The second, as certainly, determ- ined the Ministry and the nation against us
 That Mr
 Jay may have been endeavoring to get his instructions repealed I neither doubt nor wonder at, because I think they were in the highest degree improper
 It seems to me that if it had been the design to give Mr
 Gardoqui the ascendant in the negotiation, to put it in his power to know the utmost latitnde of Mr
 Jay's power while he could conceal his own, nothing could have been con- trived better to answer the purpose
 But if Mr
 Jay is deemed an unfit person, or if he has not hitherto managed the business in a manner satisfactory to Congress, take it out of his hands, and com-

 603 mit it to some other person; but let the nego' lations go on here
 Your communications with your Minister may be as frequent and easy as you please, and if it should, at any time, be found necessary to throw obstacles in the way of its progress, it cau be done with more ease than at Madrid
 I am an en tire- stranger to the circumstance you allude to relating to Mr
 Jay
 I shall always be happy to receive any communication you may please to make
 I have replied with the same freedom and with the utmost candor, which, as I intended, I trust you will accept as a testimony of the esteem and regard with which I am yours, etc
 PRESIDENT STSt. Clair TO GOVERNOR HUNTINGTON
1 NEW YORK (without date), 1787
2 Sir:—The want of a due representation in Congress, so frequently as it has happened, and for so great a length of time together, has very greatly embarrassed the affairs of the Union, and given much dissatisfaction to the States which generally keep their representations up, as well as disgust to the members who attend from those States
 It has very often been complained of, and the States not represented pressed to send their delegates forward; too often, I am sorry to be obliged to say, sir, with very little effect, although it must be obvi- ous that, independent of the great national concerns which thereby often suffer an inconvenience, at least, if not a disgraceful delay, their own particular interests run some risk from public measures being adopted without the aid of their counsels
 What must the nations of the world think of us when they shall be informed that we have appointed an assembly, and invested it with the sole and exclusive power of peace and war and the man- agement of all national concerns, and, during the course of almost a whole year, it has not been capable, except for a few days, for want of a sufficient number of members, to attend to those mat- ters? Since the first Monday in November last to this time there has been a representation of nine States only thirty days, and ten 1 Samuel Huntington, Governor of Connecticut

' States only three days, and as the representation of most of the States has consisted of only two persons, no great business could be done without the unanimous consent of every individual member
 We are now, sir, reduced to six, although matters of the highest importance are pressing for a decision, and can not be long delayed, without compromising the dignity of the Government and exposing the peace and safety of several of the States
 Besides, sir, the National Convention, which the people look up to for much good, will soon rise, and it appears to be of great consequence that, when their report comes under the consideration of Congress, it should be a full Congress, and the important business which will be laid be- fore them meet with no unnecessary delay
 The secretary wrote, not long ago, to the unrepresented States, but no effect has yet appeared to follow from it
 I must, therefore, again repeat the request, and in the most pressing terms, that your Excellency would use every means in your power to hasten forward the delegates of your State

 NEW YORK, July 19, 1787
 Dear Sir:—The President2 and myself arrived here last Tuesday morning, in time to take our seats the same day, and make up, at the same time, nine States
 The inclosed Ordinance3 had passed two days before
 Who the officers of that government will be I have not heard nor inquired
 I fear nine States will not be held up long, as some talk of going away soon; whether they will be replaced soon is uncertain

 I confess to you I am opposed to a pre-emption to any company or set of men, I think, on sound prin- ciples; and I hope to prevent this passing with that tail, however beneficial the body might be without
 I have no idea, in making a sale, to bribe a person to get him to take my commodity with another article of equal or more value
 Your dispatches have been read and committed, and I suppose will soon be taken up; but in the meantime the Dominion, accord- ing to custom, are pressing partial measures for the purpose of de- fending "Cane-tucke," as they say
 I wish for general arrange- ments at once
 At present I can not properly say more
 You will soon hear what is doing

 Nothing could add to this distinguished mark of the favor and approbation of Congress but my receiving it in so polite a manner from the hands of your Excel- lency; from you, sir, whom, in the course of thirty years, I have so often had the honor to accompany on a vast variety of military service
 Permit me, likewise, to declare the satisfaction I feel in seeing your Excellency's merits crowned by the high station you now fill with such acknowledged ability
 That the prosperity, honor, and happiness of the United States may last to the end of time, and that your Excellency may continue to enjoy the best blessings fortune can bestow, is my constant, ardent wish

 Gentlemen:—Inclosed* is a letter to General Clinton, which we 1This correspondence refers to conflicts growing out of the claims of citi- zens of Connecticut to lands in the Wyoming country, in what is Luzerne count}-
 Grants of lands were originally obtained by citizens of Connecti- cut of the Indians, lying on the rivers Susquchanna and Delaware, within the boundaries of Pennsylvania, and land companies formed bearing the names of those rivers
 Settlements and improvements were made, ami th
? State of Connecticut exercised jurisdiction over them for some years, and during the Revolutionary War
 A dispute arose between the two States as to juris- diction, and the matter finally cume before Congress
 The decision was in favor of Pennsylvania
 A large number of the citizens of Wyoming, the chief of which were two men named John Franklin and John Jenkins, re- fused to recognize what was styled the Trenton decree, and during the years 1780 nnd 1787, a condition of affairs bordering on anarchy prevailed in that section
 TbeSusquehanna Land Company prevailed on Colonel Kthan Allen, of Vermont, to visit that country, and that eccentric officer, with John Frank- lin, attempted to organize the citizens in opposition to the government of Pennsylvania, and declare that section an independent State

 TheOouncil have thought of sending a few resolute men, authorized to apprehend and bring off Frunklin scheme failed and Allen returned home
 Franklin, however, continued his violent opposition, and, at the head of M mob, seized Colonel Timothy Pick- ering, chairman of the board of commissioners appointed to hear and report on the claims of the Connecticut settlers, carried him away, anj subjected him to insult
 An armed force was finally sent by Doctor Benjamin Frank- lin, President of Pennsylvania, to seize FranUlin and other disturbers of the pence, as set forth in the correspondence above
 The mob caught the spirit of the Shay's rebellion of Massachusetts
 John FranUlin was apprehended and imprisoned for a long time, which led to correspondence between the executives of the States of Connecticut and Pennsylvania
 All the difficul- ties were happily arranged with the aid of Congress—the latter setting apart a bx dy of land on Lake Erie, west of New York, for the use of such Connecticut settlers as chose to move thither and avail themselves of free lands
 1The letter to Governor Clinton, which was inclosed, was as follows- "IN COUNCIL, September 22, 1787
 "Sir:—Your Excellency will see by the papers and letters of intelligence, which I have the honor of communicating to you, that there are a number of disorderly people collecting near the line that divides our two States, who are impatient of regular government, and seize upon and presume to dispose of lands contrary to and in defiance of the laws
 It has appeared to me by other evidence, that their numbers are daily increasing by vagabonds from all quarters, and that they expect reinforcements from Shay's late partisans, and purpose defending their pioceedings by force of arms
 Tour Excel- lency will be sensible with us of the mischief such a body of banditti may be capable of occasioning to both our States, if suffered to increase and es- tablish themselves in that country; the vicinity of the boundary line afford- ing them at present an imaginary security, since, if pursued by the authoritv of one of tlnr States, they can easily step over into the others
 Your Excel- lency's readiness manifested on other occasions to aid the operations of gen- eral justice, even in neighboring governments, leaves no room to doubt of your concurring with us in the measures that may be necessary to defeat the projects of those people, some of whose leaders are said to be inhabitants of your State; for the concerting such measures, the council of this govern- ment unanimously and earnestly request your Excellency would be pleased to permit our delegates in Congress to have a conference with you

 ARTHUR STSt. Clair TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
 NEW YORK, September 28, 1787
 Sir:—In pursuance of your Excellency's letter in Council of the 22d instant, the delegates of the State had, yesterday, a conference with Governor Clinton upon the subject of the intelligence con- tained in the papers inclosed to him
 Governor Clinton seems perfectly well disposed to concur in any general measure that may tend to preserve the peace of the two States; but he apprehends no danger from most of the persons mentioned in those papers; on the contrary, he seems to think they are disposed to become peaceable and orderly citizens of the State of New York, particularly Ar
 Moodrey (?), in whom he appeared to have a confidence
 As General Irvine and Mr
 Bingham are both going to Philadelphia, I beg leave to refer your Excellency to them for more particular information
 As to Franklin and Jenkins, the delegates are of opinion that no more proper method can be pursued than that suggested in your Excellency's letter—of sending a few resolute men to take them off; and should they be on the York side of the line, or take refuge within that State, the apprehending them will give no offense to the Government
 On the contrary, the Governor is ready to concur Beach, and John McKinstry
 Should you take all or any of these men prisoners, you are to bring them to Philadelphia
 If you take Franklin at Wilkesbarre, do not proceed any further, or run the risk of losing him by endeavoring to apprehend the others
 Council have the utmost reliance on your secresy and your prudence in conducting this affair
 If opposed by force, you are to use force and execute the warrant at all events
 B
 FRANKLIN, President
 "To Colonel John Craig

 OOP with the measure, and to that cud has proposed that the warrant that may be thought proper to issue against those men be sent here, when he will get it backed by the Chief Justice, and accompany it, so backed with his own warrant, under the privy seal, commanding the inhabitants (for they have no magistrate) of that district to be aiding and assisting in apprehending them
 Should Council then adopt the measure, if you will please to inclose the warrant to me, no time shall be lost in presenting it to Governor Clinton, and re- turning in to your Excellency

 JONES TO PRESIDENT STSt. Clair
 NEW YORK, Nm-emlter 6, 1787
 Dear General:—Having in view the attainment of a contract in France for supplying the marine with masts, building timber and naval stores from this country, and having reason to hope that un- friends, Mr
 Robert Morris and Colonel Wadsworth, will connect themselves with me in the contract if I can obtain it, I accept, with great pleasure and thankfulness', your kind offer to write to General Washington and endeavor to obtain from him a letter to the Marquis de Lafavette in favor of my project
 
Such a letter would insure the exertions of the Marquis, and might be particularly useful to me if any opening should offer within the military line, or otherwise, while I remain in Knrope
 It may be forwarded (under cover to me) to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs here, who will send it to its destination
 Permit me to offer you my thanks for the many marks I have received of your kind regard, and for the flattering honor you do me by accepting my bust, which will be sent to you as soon as I arrive in Paris
 I should be happv to hear from you; and I prav you to be assured that no man has more respect for your character, talents and greatness of mind than, dear General, your most obedient and most humble servant
