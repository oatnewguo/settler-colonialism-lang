St. Clair to Harrison 

February 17, 1800 

Cincinnati Western Spu, May 25, ISOO 

A division of the territory' is a subject on whicii I have 
thought a great deal and have fervently wished and you well 
know that from the enormous extent of it at present, it is al- 
most impossible to keep even the executive part of the govern- 
ment in order. The great and growing importance of this 
country seems never to have been attended to. In truth, there 
were few persons who knew much about it and the concerns 
of the state they represented together with the great interest 
of the Union kept it in a great measure out of sight. We may 
now hope that more attention will be paid to it and it is with 
great pleasure that I have seen that you have been appointed 
the chairman of a committee for taking its concerns into con- 
sideration. 

How much, soever, a division is to be wished, there are diffi- 
culties in the way — the increase of expense will form one ; but 
it is an ill calculation to put a little money on the scale against 
the welfare and happiness of a multitude of people. To ren- 
der the territory manageable, it would require to be divided 
into three districts ; and there it may be thought that the or- 
dinance [1787] stands in the way that has provided for a di- 
vision into two only and it is a general supposition that the 
ordinance cannot be altered but by common consent. This I 
think a mistake. There is indeed a part of it where the funda- 
mental principles of the states which may hereafter be erected 
or laid, that is declared to be a compact, not to be changed but 
by common consent ; but every other part of it is a matter in 
the power of congress to alter or repeal as a law, which may 
have passed yesterday. 

Suppose these difficulties got over, how are the districts to 
be bounded? The object of such, is that the eastern district 
should extend from the line of Pennsylvania to the great 
Miami — the middle district to comprehend the country be- 
tween the Great Miami and the Wabash and the western dis- 
trict, the country between that and the Mississippi. On that 

1. The Northwest territory was divided by act of congress. May 3. 1800, which 
organi'ied that part west of the mouth of the Big Miami river into Indiana territory. 
U. S. Statutes at Large, Sixth Congress, Sec. I, Ch. il 



 

proposition, I would observe that the eastern division would 
be still too large and in the middle one, there would be very 
few people and that the Indian title to a great part of it, is 
not extinguished. The manner that strikes me as most eligi- 
ble is that the Scioto and a line drawn north from the forks 
of it, should form the western boundary of the eastern district 
— a line drawn north from that part of the Indian boundary 
opposite the mouth of the Kentucky the western boundary of 
the middle division and the western division to comprehend 
all the country between that line and the Mississippi. The 
material advantages would in this manner remain to every 
part — Marietta would most probably be the seat of the gov- 
ernment in the eastern district and sufficiently convenient to 
every part of it. Cincinnati would continue to be with equal 
convenience the seat of the middle district and St. Vincennes 
in the western, not indeed equally convenient, but more so 
than any other place that could be chosen. 

There are many other advantages which would flow from 
this measure which I will not trouble you with ; I will only ob- 
serve that almost any division into two parts which could be 
made would ruin Cincinnati. 

Harrison to His Constituents' 

Phila, Pa. 14th May, 1800 

Westeryi Spy, June 11, 1800 

DEAR Sir : 

The ardent desire I feel to visit again my native state, from 
which I have been upwards of seven years absent, and the 
whole of that time engaged in public service in the western 
country, will I feel, put it out of my power to return to the 
territory until after the ensuing session of congress. I have 
therefore thought proper to make this circular communication 
that my fellow-citizens may be in some measure informed on 
the subject acted upon by the national legislature at their late 
session; but particularly on those which relate more immedi- 
ately to their own interests. 

1. Hariison finished his first session as delegate from the Northwest territory. May 
14. 1800. He intended to sDend the recess till Novemher in visiting his old home in 
Virginia. For political reasons and in line with the general custom he sent the following 
circular to the newspapers of his district. While not strictly within the field of these 
papers it forms a good introduction to the subject and the man, especially the reference 
to the division of the Northwest territory and the organization of Indiana territory. 



 

Amongst the variety of objects which engage my attention, 
as peculiarly interesting to our territory, none appeared to me 
of so much importance as the adoption of a system for the sale 
of public lands, which would give more favoi'able terms to that 
class of purchasers who are likely to become actual settlers, 
than was offered by the existing laws upon that subject : con- 
formably to this idea I procured the passage of a resolution at 
an early period of the session for the appointment of a com- 
mittee to take the matter into consideration. And shortly 
after I reported a bill containing terms for the purchasers as 
favorable as could have been expected. This bill was adopted 
by the House of Representatives without any material altera- 
tion ; but in the Senate, amendments were introduced obliging 
the purchaser to pay interest on that part of the money for 
which a credit was given, from the date of the purchase and 
directed that one half the land (instead of the whole as was 
provided by the bill from the House of Representatives) 
should be sold in half sections of 320 acres and the other half 
in whole sections of 640 acres. All my exertions, aided by 
some of the ablest members of the lower house at a conference 
for that purpose, were not sufficient to induce the Senate to 
recede from their amendments; but upon the whole, there is 
cause of congratulation to my fellow-citizens, that terms as 
favorable as the bill still contains have been procured. This 
law promises to be the foundation of a great increase of popu- 
lation and wealth to our country ; for although the minimum 
price of land is still fixed at two dollars per acre, the time for 
making payments has been so extended as to put it in the 
power of every industrious man to comply with them, it being 
only necessary to pay one-fourth part of the money on hand 
and the balance at the end of two, three and four years ; be- 
sides this odious circumstance of forfeiture, which was made 
the penalty of failing in the payments, of the old law, is in en- 
tirely abolished and the purchaser is allowed one year after 
the last payment is due to collect the money, if the land is not 
then paid for, it is sold and after the public have been reim- 
bursed, the balance of the money is returned to the purchaser. 
Four land offices are directed to be opened— one at Cincinnati, 
one at Chilicotha, one at Marietta and one at Steubenville, for 
the sale of lands in the neighborhood of those places. In a 
communication of this kind it is impossible to detail all the 



 

provisions of the law ; I have, however, sent a copy of it to the 
printers at Cincinnati, with a request that they would publish 
it several weeks. 

A law supplementary to the act appropriating land for the 
satisfying of the United States military warrants has been 
enacted, warrants have been located, the patents issued and 
many persons, who are holders of those lands, are preparing 
to make settlement on them the ensuing summer. 

Petitions and letters from various parts of the territory, 
having been forwarded to me, expressed a desire that the terri- 
tory should be divided into two great governments and as my 
opinion of the policy of the measure strongly coincided with 
them, a bill was passed by the House of Representatives on my 
motion for this purpose ; and that line which is declared by the 
ordinance of congress [1787] for the govemment of the terri- 
tory, the line of division between the eastern and middle states 
was to have formed the division between the opposite districts ; 
this bill also received very material alteration in the Senate, 
which altei'ations were finally adopted by the House of Repre- 
sentatives and the bill passed into a law. The division line by 
this law, runs from the mouth of the Kentucky River to Ft. 
Recovery and from thence north till it intersects the northern 
boundary of the United States, running through the lakes. 
The western division is called "the Indiana Territory" and the 
other district is to retain the appellation of territory of the 
United States, northwest of the Ohio and is to remain in every 
respect in stain quo. The most objectionable part of the bill 
is that it fixed the seat of goveniment for the eastern division ; 
and it was opposed by me on the grounds of its being a viola- 
tion of the ordinance for the govemment of the territory, 
which gives the sole and exclusive right of legislature to the 
general assembly of the territory, but in the cases, where it is 
expressly withheld.' 

However, as the seat of the government is fixed at Chili- 
cothe which is certainly the most central and eligible situation 
and as the continuance of the legislature at Cincinnati for the 
short time that the territory will remain under its present de- 
pendent form of government can be of very little moment to 
the citizens of that place and none to the neighboring country ; 
we have nothing to regret upon the subject, but the fear that

the interference of Congress in a matter over which, in my 
opinion, they had no cognizance may establish a precedent of 
control over our legislature which may be productive of future 
evil. But the unanimous disapprobation of the principle ex- 
pressed by the House of Representatives in their rejecting the 
amendment of the Senate in the first instance and the warm 
opposition which it met with in the Senate itself gives good 
ground to hope that no attempt will be hereafter made to re- 
vise it. 

The petitions from the people living between the Great 
and Little Miami and above the land patented to Judge 
[John Cleves] Symmes, which were forwarded to me, were 
presented to the House of Representatives and the selected 
committee to whom were referred generally the business re- 
lating to lands, were charged to examine into them and to 
report by bill or otherwise. As I was myself the chairman of 
this committee, I thought it proper to make my suit whenever 
the subject of these petitions were under consideration. The 
committee then consisted of the following members viz : Mr. 
[Jonathan] Brace of Connecticut, Mr. [Samuel] Lyman of 
Massachusetts, Mr. [William] Gordon of New Hampshire, Mr. 
[Albert] Gallatin, of Pennsylvania, Mr. [William Barry 
Grove] Glove^ of North Carolina and Mr. [Thomas Terry] 
Davis of Kentucky ; after a very lengthy investigation and dis- 
cussion of the subject (at which I was always present) a bill 
was reported containing the unanimous opinion of the commit- 
tee; the principal features of the bill were that if Judge 
Symmes, should pay into the treasury of the United States on 
or before the 1st day of February, 1802, five shillings per acre 
in specie for the land between his patent line and that which 
was run by Mr. [Israel] Ludlow from the head spring of the 
Little Miami to the Great Miami, with the interest from the 
15th of July, 1795 ; the President of the United States should 
make him a patent for the said land in trust for himself and 
the persons who had purchased of him and who at the time of 
the passing of the act were entitled in equity to the land they 
had contracted for. And if the judge should fail to give notice 
on or before the 1st day of January next, that he acceded to all 
the terms and conditions of this act, or should fail to make the 
payment at the time specified, then the purchasers under him 



 

were to have the land at the same prices that it was to be 
granted to him, with the additional advantage of one year to 
raise the money from and after the 1st of February, 1802. It 
was also required of Judge Symmes to convey in fee simple to 
such trustees as the legislature of the territory may think 
proper to appoint, land equal in quality and quantity, to the 
township reserved in his former patent for the purpose of ed- 
ucation and the legislature were authorized t(3 receive such 
land as an equivalent for the said township ; the bill was final- 
ly adopted by the House of Representatives without a dissent- 
ing voice. The Senate referred it to a select committee, con- 
sisting of Messrs. [James] Ross, [John] Brown and [Samuel] 
Livermore, who reported the bill without amendment; but 
the day before the session closed, Mr. Ross moved to strike 
out the whole bill for the purpose of inserting a new one (the 
object of which I have not learnt) but this was rejected and 
for want of time the business was finally postponed until the 
next session. Whilst the bill was before the committee of 
the Senate, it was suggested to me that doubt had arisen 
with some whether those persons who had sued Judge Synm:ies 
in the courts of common pleas would be entitled to remedy 
in equity against the Judge. I therefore went before the 
committee and urged them to insert a provision in their favor, 
declaring that it was the meaning of the committee who 
formed the bill that those persons should be entitled to all 
the benefits arising from it and that I should object to the 
passage of the bill if they were not included; but upon my 
stating the question to the attorney general of the United 
States, to Mr. [Robert G.] Harper and other characters emi- 
nent in the law, it was their unanimous opinion that they 
were within the provision of the act. I send a copy as it 
passed the House of Representatives to the printers in Cin- 
cinnati. What I have given you is the substance of this bill. 
Nothing surely could be more fair towards the purchasers 
and I had in view the pleasing prospect that this law would 
be the means of restoring harmony and peace to the hitherto 
distracted settlement between the two Miamis. In the man- 
agement of this business, I was placed from my connection 
[son-in-law] with Judge Symmes in the most delicate situ- 
ation; whether my conduct has been such as to merit the 
approbation of my friends and disappoint the malice of my 
enemies is not for me to declare: mv fellow-citizens will de- 



 

termiiio it for me ; and well I may sure believe that my whole 
conduct was meant to be guided by moral integrity. A law 
in addition to the act upon the subject of post offices and post 
roads has been passed and a post is ordered to go from Louis- 
ville to Vincennes and Kaskaskias ; a post office is also estab- 
lished at Manchester in the county of Adams. It would have 
been very desirable to have extended the benefits of this estab- 
lishment to Detroit, but the great number of additional post 
roads which were applied for at this session from every state 
in the Union, has drawn so large upon the post office funds, 
that I have found it impossible for the present to have it 
effected; indeed from the want of information upon the sub- 
ject, I could not say whether the measure would be burthen- 
some to the United States or not. I recommended it to my 
fellow citizens of that place if they supposed that the emolu- 
ments of a post office there would support the expense of con- 
veying the mail, to make an offer to the post master general 
for taking upon themselves the risk of the establishment; 
this was done by the people of Vincennes and the Illinois 
country and as there was no reason to believe that it would 
not have been done if their loss had been very great; the 
committee of the House of Representatives adopted their 
road without hesitation. 

A law for the purpose of designating a tract of land upon 
which the ancient inhabitants of the Illinois, who were en- 
titled to donation, under the act of the 3rd of March, 1791, 
might locate the same, was passed. 

A bill was also reported making a disposition of the salt 
springs on the public lands and was postponed until the next 
session. 

Several other matters of great importance to our territory 
were also unavoidably postponed. I regret exceedingly that 
it was not in my power to procure the passage of a law au- 
thorizing the appointment of commissioners for the purpose 
of adjusting the land terrors in the county of Wayiie [De- 
troit] and for enlarging and ascertaining the boundaries of 
that county and those of the Mississippi and Wabash ; but the 
great press of business for the last three months of the ses- 
sion rendered it utterly impossible. I was also very desirous 
to have the territory formed into a separate revenue district 
and the secretary of the treasury promised to report in favor 
of it officially to congress; but the multiplicity of his duties 



 

prevented him. We may, however, with confidence, promise 
ourselves that both these measures will be adopted at the 
next session of congress. 

Among the laws of a general nature which were passed at 
the late session are the following: 

1st. "An act providing for the second census or enumera- 
tion of the inhabitants of the United States". The census in 
the territory is to be taken under the direction of the sec- 
retary. 

2nd. "An act to establish an uniform system of bank- 
ruptcy throughout the United States". 

3rd. "An act further to suspend the commercial inter- 
course between the United States and France and the de- 
pendencies thereof." 

4th. "An act to suspend in part an act entitled "an act 
to augment the army of the United States and for other pur- 
poses". This act directs the suspension of enlistment in the 
army which will cause a saving to the public revenue of one 
million of dollars. 

By the latest arrivals from Europe, we are informed that 
the French government has received our commissioners with 
great cordiality and that three persons have been nominated 
by the chief Consul to open all negotiations with them upon 
the existing differences between the two nations: it is gen- 
erally thought that an accommodation will take place — in 
which event the whole of the additional army will be dis- 
banded. 

With respect and regards, 
I am, Dear Sir, 

Your very humble servant, 

William Henry Harrison

Harrison to Findlay 

Richmond, Va., July 18, 1800 
Pub. Hist, and Phil. Soc. of Ohio, I, 100 
Dear [James] Findlay,' 

It has been a long time since I received a line from you — 
what can be the reason? I arrived here with my wife and 
family about six weeks ago. Mrs. H. is not very well. What 
are you doing at Cincinnati? does trade flourish? are the crops 
promising? what has our Distiller done last winter? I should 
like to hear from you on all these subjects. I expect to leave 
this State about the 10th of October for the Ohio and shall 
see you at Cincinnati about the 10th of November. Who is 
talked of as my successor in Congress? Do not abuse me for 
filling my letter with interrogatories; I could give you no in- 
telligence from hence, that would not be old by the time you 
received it, as you get the Philadelphia papers regularly. By 
a paragraph in the Norfolk paper of Monday last I see that 
General [James] Wilkinson and his family have arrived there 
after a tempestuous voyage of 35 days from the mouth of 
the Mississippi. I must get the favour of you to enter with 
the auditor the following described land and pay the taxes for 
it — 4,000 acres surveyed for my brother-in-law, Anthony 
Singleton deceased. I do not know where this land has been 
located except one thousand acres which is described as lying 
on the waters of the little Miami and of course in Hamilton 
County. The other 3,000 acres must be entered as lying some 
where in the Virginia Reserve between the Scioto and Miami. 
The quality of this land is not known so that it must be 
entered second Rate. I wish you to enter and pay also for 
1,000 acres of land the property of Seth Bird of the State of 
New York in the Ohio Company purchase. The site of this 
land is not known either but I suppose if the money is paid 
to the Auditor it will prevent a forfeiture; don't fail to pay 
the taxes on this land as I have promised the o\vner that it 
shall not be neglected. 

1. James Findlay of Cincinnati became one of the first 5 councillors of the North- 
west territory in 1799 and helped 'elect Harrison to eonsress. He was a native of 
Penn. In the War of 1812 he was colonel of the Second Ohio volunteers. He served 
in Cong. 1825-1833 and in 1834 ran for governor on the Democratic ticket. He was 
involved deeply in the Burr affair. He was a leading business man of Cincinnati, a 
manufacturer, a partner of Harrison. Jacob Burnet and John H. Piatt: died in 
Cincinnati Dec. 21. 1835, 



 

Give Mrs. Harrison's and my best regards to Mrs. Findlay 
and to Smith and all our mutual friends. 
Yours truly, 

William H. Harrison

The Governor Issued a proclamation for the meeting of the 
legislature, and requiring the attendance of the judges of the 
territory, on Monday the 12th of this instant at St. Vincennes 
for the purpose of adopting and publishing such laws, as the 



 

exigencies of the government may require, and for the per-

Congress, for the government of the territory.- 

Proclamation : Dividing Knox County, and Erecting 
Clark County 

February 3, 1801 

Executive Jouiiial, 2 

The governor [Harrison] Issued a proclamation dividing 
the county of Knox and erecting a separate county to be 
stiled the county of Clark the boundaries of which are as 
follows: beginning at the Ohio river at the mouth of Blew 
river, thence up the said river to the crossing of the same 
by the Road [Buffalo Trace] leading from Saint Vincennes 
to Clarksville, thence by a direct line to the nearest part of 
White River [Driftwood, or East Fork], thence up the said 
river and that branch [Blue River] thereof which runs toward 
Fort Recoveiy, and from the head springs of said branch to 
Fort Recovery, thence along the boundary line between the 
Indiana, and Northwestern Territory, to the Ohio, thence 
down the same river to the place of beginning at the same 
time directing the first session of said courts to be held at 
Springville in said county. 

1. The refeiences to the Executive Journal a:c to the minted version in Indiana 
Historical Society Publications. Ill, No. 3 (1900). The original pagination is cited as 
therein given. Although the act setting off Indiana Territory was approved May 7, 
1800, and Governor Harrison was appointed May 13. he did not arrive in the new 
Territory until early in the ne.xt year. Meanwhile the necessary measures for the 
administration of the Territory were tal<en by Secretary John Gibson. The Executive 
Journal, kept by the secretary, begins with these words, under date of July 4, 1800: 
"This day the government of Indiana Territory commenced." The issuance of the 
proclamation of January 10, 1801. is the first evidence we have of Harrison's pres- 
ence at Vincennes. The last preceding entry in the Executive Journal is dated November 
5, 1800. The proclamation no doubt was read to the three judges who with the gov- 
ernor constituted the territorial legislature. The text of this proclamation has not 
been found. 

2. The three judges were William Clark, chief justice. Heniy Vander Burgh, second 
judge, and John Griffin, third judge. Clark died at Vincennes. November II, 1802; 
Vander Burgh died at Vincennes April 12. 1812. December 23, 1805 President Jefferson 
nominated Griffin "judge of the tei-ritoi-y of Michigan, agreeably to his own desires, 
as is represented." (Executive Journal U. S. Senate.) Waller Taylor was appointed 
judge April 14, 1806. Benjamin Parke was appointed in place of Thomas Terry Davis 
April 21, 1808. Davis was appointed February 4. 1803 on the death of Clark. For

Proclamation : Altering the Boundaries of Knox, Ran- 
dolph AND St. Clair Counties 

February 3, 1801 

Executive Jom-nal, 3 

The governor [Harrison] issued a proclamation altering the 
boundary lines of the counties of Knox, Randolph and St. 
Clair as follows, to wit ; the boundary of the county of Ran- 
dolph shall begin on the Ohio river at a place called the 
Great Cave [Cave-in-rock] below the Saline Lick [near Shaw- 
neetown], thence by a direct north line until it intersects an 
east and west line running from the Mississippy through the 
Sink hole springs [this line still separates St. Clair and Ran- 
dolph counties] ; thence along the said line to the Mississippy 
thence down the Mississippi to the mouth of the Ohio and up 
the Ohio to the place of beginning-. The county of St. Clair 
shall be bounded on the south by the beforementioned east 
and west line, running from the Mississippi through the Sink 
hole Spring to the intersection of the north line running from 
the Great Cave aforesaid, thence from the said point of in- 
tersection by a direct line to the mouth of the great Ken- 
noumic river [Great Calumet] falling into the southerly bend 
of Lake Michigan, thence by a direct north east line to the 
division line between the Indiana and North Westm Terri- 
torys, thence along the said line to the territorial boundary 
of the United States, and along the said Boundary line to the 
Intersection thereof with the Mississippi and down the Mis- 
sissippi to the place of beginning. The county of Knox shall 
be bounded by the Ohio from the Great Cave above mentioned 
to the mouth of Blue river, thence up the said river and 
along the lines and boundaries seperating the said county of 
Knox from the county of Clarke, in their whole extent to 
Fort Recovery, thence along the line seperating the Indiana 
from the North Westrn Territory, until it will intersect a 
line drawn north east from the mouth of the great Ken- 
noumic River aforesaid and along the said Line to the mouth 
of the Great Kennoumic river thence by a line running from 
the mouth of said river so as to strike the point of intersec- 
tion formed by a line drawn due east through the Sink Hole 
spring above mentioned and a line dra%vTi due north from the 
great cave above mentioned and along the last mentioned line 
to the said Great Cave the place of beginning.

1. Springville was located on donations 94 and 115, Clark's Grant, about two 
miles west of Chailestown. There seems to have been a trading post there in the 
eighteenth century. The town site was plotted in 1800. The home of Jonathan Jen- 
nings was nearby. It was a thriving little village of Indian traders until June 9. 1802 
when JeflEersonville became the county seat. One of the French traders was named 
Tully and the Indians called the place Tullytown. 

2. A court had been established by Governor St. Clair at Clarksville near what 
is now Jeffersonville, Januai-y 8, 1790 ; see also proclamation of February 3, 1801. June 
9, 1802, the governor by proclamation designated Jeffersonville as the county seat and 
ordered the courts to meet there on August 1. following. 



 

Harrison to the Secretary of War 

July 15th, 1801 

Dawson, Harrison, 10-11 

Sir 

For the last ten or twelve weeks I have been constantly 
engaged in receiving visits from the Chiefs of most of the 
Indian nations which inhabit this part of the Territory. They 
all profess and I believe that most of them feel a friendship 
for the United States — but they make heavy complaints of 
ill treatment on the part of our Citizens. They say that their 
people have been killed — their lands settled on — their game 
wontonly destroyed — & their young men made drunk & 
cheated of the peltries which formerly procured them neces- 
sary articles of Cloathing, arms and amunition to hunt with. 
Of the truth of all these charges I am well convinced. The 
Delaware Chiefs in their address to me mentioned the loss of 
six persons of their nation, since the treaty of Greenvill hav- 
ing been killed by the White people — & I have found them 
correct as to number. In one instance however the White 
boy who killed the Indian was tried and acquitted as it was 
proved that it was done in self defence. In another instance 
the Murderrer was tried and acquitted by the Jury, altho it 
was very evident that it was a cruel and unprovoked murder. 
About twelve months ago a Delaware was killed in this To\vn 
by a Citizen of the Territoiy against whom a bill has been 
found by the grand. He has however escaped and it is re- 
ported that he has gone to Natchez or New Orleans. [See 
May 5, 1802, below.] But the case which seems to have af- 
fected the Indians more than any other is the murder of two 
men and one woman of this same nation about three years 
ago. This cruel deed was perpetrated on this side of the 
Ohio, forty or fifty miles below the falls & is said to have 
been attended with circumstances of such atrocity as almost 
to discredit the whole story — were it not but too evident that 
a great many of the Inhabitants of the Fronteers consider 
the murdering of Indians in the highest degree meritorious — 
the story is this. About three years ago two Delaware men 
and a woman were quietly hunting in the neighbourhood of 
the Ohio — I believe on the waters of Blue river their Camp 
was discovered by two men I think of the name of Williams — 
brothers — and these Williams mutually determined to murder 



 

them for the purpose of possessing themselves of about fifty 
dollars worth of property and the trifling equipage belonging 
to the hunting Camp of a Savage. They thought it too dan- 
gerous to attack them openly as one of the Indians well known 
to the white people by the name of Jim Galloway or Gilloway 
— was remarkable for his strength and bi'avery. They ap- 
proached the camp as friends & as I am toled they have since 
confessed asked leave to stay at the Indians Camp and hunt 
for a few days. Their request was granted & they remained 
until a favorite opportunity offered to carry their design into 
effect — & the then Indians were murdered. Altho they were 
missed by their friends it was a long time before their fate 
was ascertained. The murderers thinking themselves safe 
from the length of time which has elapsed, now begin to talk 
of the affair, and one of them is said to have declared that 
he was very nearly over-powered by the Indian after he had 
wounded him — that he had closed in with him and the Indian 
was on the point of getting the better of him when his brother 
to whom the murder of the other Indian had been committed 
came to his assistance. Altho I am convinced that the facts 
above stated are all true — yet so difficult is it to get testi- 
mony in a case of this kind, that I have not as yet been able 
to get the necessary depositions on which to ground an ap- 
plication to the Executive of Kentucky for the delivery of 
these people to Justice. Whenever I have ascertained that 
the Indian boundary line has been encroached on by the white 
people I have caused the Intruders to withdraw. But as tJie 
boundary line seperating the Indian land from that to which 
the title has been extinguished has not been run — nor the 
manner in which it is to run precisely ascertained either at 
this place or in the country on the Mississippi called the Illi- 
nois — it is impossible to tell when encroachments are made 
on the Indians at those two places. As this is an object of 
considerable importance to the Citizens of the Territory I 
must beg you Sir to obtain the directions of the President to 
have it done as soon as possible. The people have been about 
petitioning Congress on this subject — Untill it was observed 
that the President was authorized by law to cause all the 
boundaries between the lands of the U.N. States & the Indian 
tribes to be ascertained and marked — Untill their boundaries 
are established it is almost impossible to punish in this quar- 
ter the persons who make a practice of Hunting on the lands 



 

of the Indians in violation of law and our Treaty with that 
people. This practice has grown into a monsti-ous abuse. 
Thousands of the wild animals from which the Indians derive 
their subsistance have been distroyed by the white people. 
They complain in their speeches to me that many parts of 
their Country which abounded with game when the general 
peace was made in 1795 now scarcely contains a sufficiency 
to give food to the f iew Indians who pass through there. The 
people of Kentucky living on the Ohio from the mouth of the 
Kentucky river dowTi the Mississippi make a constant pi-ac- 
tice of crossing over on the Indian lands opposite to them 
every fall to kill deer, bear, and buffaloe — the latter from 
being a great abundance a few yeai's ago is now scarcely to 
be met with, in that whole extent. One white hunter will 
distroy more game than five of the common Indians — the lat- 
ter generally contenting himself with a sufficiency for present 
subsistance — while the other eager after game hunt for the 
skin of the animal alone. All these Injuries the Indians have 
hitherto borne with astonishing patience but altho they dis- 
cover no disposition to make v/ar upon the United States at 
present — I am confident that most of the tribes would eagerly 
seize any favorable opportunity for that purpose — & should 
the United States be at war with any of the European na- 
tions who are known to the Indians there would probably be 
a combination of nine tenths of the Northern Tribes against 
us— Unless some means are made use of to conciliate them. 
The British have been unremitted in their exertions to pre- 
serve their influence over the Indians resident within our Ter- 
ritory ever since the surrender of the Forts upon the Lake — 
& those exertions are still continued — last year they delivered 
a greater quantity of goods to their Indians than they have 
been ever known to do — and I have been lately informed that 
talks are now circulating amongst them, which are intended 
to lesten the small influence we have over the Indians — I can- 
not vouch for the truth of this report — but I think it very 
probable that the British will redouble their eff"orts to keep 
the Indians in their Interest as a mean of assisting them in 
any designs they may form against Louisiana which it is said 
will be shortly delivered up to the French. 

I have had much difficulty with the small tribes in this 
immediate Neighbourhood — viz. — the Peankashaws, Weas & 
Eel river Indians, these three tribes form a body of the 



 

greatest Scoundrels in the world— they are dayly in this town 
in considerable numbers and are frequently intoxicated to the 
number of thirty or forty at once — they then commit the 
greatest disorders — drawing their knives and stabing every 
one they meet with — breaking open the Houses of the Citi- 
zens killing their Hogs and cattle and breaking down their 
fences. But in all their frolicks they generally suffer most 
severely themselves they kill each other without mercy, some 
years ago as many as four were found dead in the morning — 
& altho these murders are actually committed in the streets 
of the town, yet no attempt to punish them has ever been 
made. This forbearance has made them astonishingly inso- 
lent & on a late occasion (within 8 weeks) when one of these 
rascals had killed without provocation two of the Citizens in 
one of the Traders Houses in this place, & it was found im- 
possible to apprehend him alive, he was put to death. This 
peice of Justice so exasperated those of his tribe in the neigh- 
bourhood that they actually assembled in the borders of the 
town with a design to seize some favourable opportunity of 
doing mischief — the Militia were ordered out and their re- 
sentment has subsided. 

Should you think proper to garrison Fort Knox with a small 
body of troops it will be the means of keeping the Indians 
under much better controle when they come here to trade — & 
would enable the civil Magistrates to punish those who violate 
the laws. Inded I do not think that a militaiy force is so 
necessary on any part of the fronteers as at this place — the 
inhabitants tho fully able to repulse them when aware of their 
designs are constantly in danger from their treachery. Five 
Hundred Warriers might introduce themselves into the settle- 
ment undiscovered by the White people — & after doing all the 
mischief in their power might make — their escape with as 
much facility. I do not indeed apprehend in the least that 
the neighbouring tribes have any inclination to make open 
war upon us — I fear only the effect of some sudden resent- 
ment arrising from their constant intercourse with the people 
of this town. In this intercourse causes of irritation are con- 
stantly produced twice within a few weeks an appeal was made 
to arms by both parties — one occasioned by some drunken In- 
dians attempting to force a House in which one was killed 
and an other wounded. The other at the time when the two 



 

white men were killed as above mentioned. Luckily however 
no other mischief was done in either instance. 

The Indian Chiefs complain heavily of the mischiefs pro- 
duced by the enormous quantity of Whiskey which the Traders 
introduce into their Country. I do not believe there are more 
than six Hundred Warriers upon this River (the Wabash) 
and yet the quantity of whiskey brought here annually for 
their use is said to amount to at least six thousand Gallons. 
This poisonous liquor not only incapasitates them from ob- 
taining a living by Hunting but it leads to the most attrocious 
crimes — killing each other has become so customary amongst 
them that it is no longer a crime to murder those whom 
they have been most accustomed to estem and regard. Their 
Chiefs and their nearest relations fall under the strokes of 
their Tomhawks & Knives. This has been so much the case 
with the three Tx'ibes nearest us— the Peankashaws, Weas, 
& Eel River Miamis that there is scarcely a Chief to be found 
amongst them. 

The little Beaver a Wea Chief of note well known to me 
was not long since murdered by his own son. The Little Fox 
another Chief who was always a friend to the white people 
was murdered at mid day in the Streets of this by one of his 
own nation. All these Horrors are produced to these Un- 
happy people by their too frequent intercourse with the White 
people. This is so cirtain that I can at once tell by looking 
at an Indian whom I chance to meet whether he belong to a 
Neighbouring or a more distant Tribe. The latter is generally 
well Clothed healthy and vigorous the former half naked, 
filthy and enfeebled with Intoxication, and many of them 
without arms except a Knife which they carry for the most 
vilanous purposes. The Chiefs of the Kickapoos, Sacks, & 
Patawatimies, who lately visited me are sensible of the prog- 
ress of these measures, and their Views amongst themselves — 
which they are convinced will lead to utter exterpation — and 
earnestly desire that the introduction of such large quantities 
of Whiskey amongst them may be prevented. 

Whether some thing ought not to be done to prevent the re- 
proach which will attach to the American Character by the 
exterpation of so many human beings, I beg leave most re- 
spectfuly to submit to the Consideration of the President — 
That this exterpation will happen no one can doubt who knows 
the astonishing annual decrease of these unhappy beings. The 



 

Delawares are now making an other attempt to become agri- 
culturists — they are forming settlements upon the White 
river a branch of the Wabash under the conduct of two Mis- 
sionaries of the Society of "The United Brethren for propo- 
gating the gospel amongst the Heathens" otherwise Meravi- 
ans.^ To assist them in this plan the Chiefs desire that one 
half of their next annuity may be laid out in impliments of 
agriculture, and in the purchase of some domestic animals 
as Cows and Hogs. The Kaskaskeas & Peankashaws request 
the same thing and the Patawatimies wish a few corse hoes 
may be sent with their goods. The sun a great Chief of the 
last mentioned Nation requests that a Coat and Hat of the 
Uniform of the United States & to prevent Jealousy a few 
more may be aded for the other Chiefs, of his nation. Indeed 
I am convinced that nothing would please the Chiefs of all 
the Nations so much as a distinction of this kind. It was a 
method always persued by the British and nothing did more 
to preserve their Influance. I therefore take the liberty of 
recommending that about a half dozen Coats made in the 
unifonn of the United States and ordinary Cocked Hats may 
be sent for each of the nations who have an annuity of one 
thousand dollars, and Half that number for the Nations who 
receive 500 dollars — the expence to be taken from the allow- 
ance of each nation. The Kickapoos who are a strong and 
warlike Nation have not a proper proportion of goods al- 
lowed them by the United States their annuity is 500 dollars 
only, which is the sum allowed to the remnant of the Kas- 
kaskias which have only fifteen or twenty wai*riors. The 
Kickapoos of the Priaria a large branch of that nation never 
receive any part of the goods. They frequently steal Horses 
which are never returned because they do not fear the with- 
holding of their annuity. The Socks a vei-y large nation 
which Inhabit the Waters of the Illinois River are not bound 
by any treaty — and will not deliver up horses or prisones in 
their possession. I have reason to believe that there are sev- 
eral persons still with them which were taken during the late 
war. They say they are very willing to treat if they are put 
upon the same footing that the rest of the Indian Nations are.

Proclamation : Forbidding Traders from Selling Liquor 
TO Indians in and around Vincennes 

July 20, 1801 

Executive Journal, i 

This day the Governor Issued a proclamation expressly for- 
bidding any Trader from selling or giving any Spirituous 
Liquors to any Indian or Indians in the Town of Vincennes 
and ordering that the Traders in future when the sold Liquor 
to the Indians should deliver it to them at the distance of at 
least a mile from the village or on the other side of the 
Wabash River. And Whereas certain evil disposed persons 
have made a practice of purchasing from the Indians (and 
giveing them Whiskey in exchange) articles of Cloathing, 
Cooking, and such other articles as are used in hunting, viz ; 
Guns powder, Ball &c. he has thought proper to publish an 
Extract from the Laws of the United States, that the persons 
offending against the Law may know the penalties to which 
they are subject, he also extorts [exhorts] and requires all 
Magistrates and other Civil officers vigilantly to discharge 
their duties, by punishing, as the Law directs, all persons who 
are found drunk, or rioting in the streets or public houses; 
and requests and advises, the good Citizens of the Territory 
to aid and assist the Magistrates, in the execution of the 
Laws by Lodgeing information against, and by assisting to 
apprehend the disorderly and rioutuos persons, who con- 
stantly infest the streets of Vincennes and to inform against 
all those who violate the Sabbath by selling or Bartering 
Spirituous Liquors or who pursue any other unlawful business 
on the day set apart for the service of God.^ [Abstract] 



 

Proclamation : Against Trading with the Indians 

August 31, 1801 

Executive Journal, i 

Frequent complaints having been made to the Governor by 
the Indians of the great mischiefs which have arisen from 
the Traders frequenting their Hunting Camps, the Governor 
Issued a proclamation notifying them that a regulation has 
been made by the Executive of the United States which de- 
clares that all persons who receive Licenses to trade with the 
Indians should confine themselves to the Towns and not fol- 
low the Indians to their Hunting grounds and that in future 
the said regulation would be strictly Enforced, and require- 
ing all concerned to govern themselves accordingly; and 
whereas he had received undoubted information that a num- 
ber of persons who were now trading in the Indian Country 
without Licences in Contempt of the Laws and authority of 
the United States he in the same proclamation Charged and 
required all officers Civil and Military Legally authorized to 
apprehend the persons and seize the goods of all such offend- 
ers, to the end that they may be dealt Mith according to Law.^

Dear Findlay, 

I had the pleasure to receive your letter of the 22nd August 
a few weeks ago. Mrs. Harrison and myself are much re- 
joiced to hear that ]\Irs. Findlay enjoys better health than 
formerly for be assured that we both feel for her a sincere 
regard. My family have I think enjoyed quite as much 
health here as they have ever done. My youngest child' has 
been until lately a good deal afflicted but is now much better ; 
and I have had the ague and fever — that is, I had three fits 
of it, but am now as well perhaps better than I have been for 
several years. I am much pleased with this country — nothing 
can exceed its beauty and fertility. I have purchased a fann

of about 300 acres joining the town which is all cleared. I 
am now engaged in fencing it and shall begin to build next 
spring if I can find the means. How comes on the Distillery ?- 
I wish you to send me some Whiskey as soon as possible, 
consign it to the care of Messrs. Prather & Smiley of Louis- 
ville who will take charge of it and send me also a couple of 
calf skins and a little soal leather. Cant you continue to patch 
up some sort of settlement between us? I will leave entirely 
to yourself knowing that it will be done as well as the cir- 
cumstances will permit; for my part I know nothing of the 
business. 

I wish you could muster resolution enough to take the woods 
and pay us a visit, I am sure you will be so much pleased 
with this place and the prospects that you would consent to 
move here. I now nominate to you Mr. William Prince^ as 
a proper person to be appointed your Deputy here. He is 
a very honest man and a clever fellow\ We have here a Com- 
pany of troops commanded by Honest F. Johnston^ of the 4th. 
We generally spend half the day together making war upon 
the partridges, grouse and fish- — the latter we take in great 
numbers in a seine. Is there no one with you who will pur- 
chase my tract of land on Mill Creek below Simmons Hutchin- 
son (word illegible) Mill? I have there 419 acres which I 
would sell very low. I dont know but I would take two Dol- 
lars per acre in cash. 

I have long given up the Judge [John Cleves Symmes, his 
father-in-law] as a ruined man — which he owes in part to 
himself but much more to the cursed Malevolence of his 
enemys. They have however in some measure got this re- 
ward in the loss of character. I have heard several disinter- 
ested respectable persons speak of the treatment he has met 
with, with horror and detestation. Give Mrs. Harrison's and 
my best regai'ds to Mrs. Findlay and to Smith if he is in the 
land of the living — to Dr. Sillman and family and all who re- 
member us with friendship. JL5'G'L90o 

2. Harrison and James Smith in 1797 operated a distillery on Deer Creek. After 
losing considerable money he gave up the business.

Harrison to Secretary of State 

ViNCENNES, January 19, 1802 
American State Papers; Public Lanch, I, 123 

The circumstances mentioned in this letter I have consid- 
ered of sufficient importance to be communicated to the Presi- 
dent. The court established at this place, under the author- 
ity of the State of Virginia, in the year 1780, (as I have 
before done myself the honor to inform you) assumed to 
themselves the right of granting lands to every applicant. 
Having exercised this power for some time [1780-1788] with- 
out opposition, they began to conclude that their right over 
the land was supreme, and that they could with as much pro- 
priety grant to themselves as to others. Accordingly, an 
arrangement was made, by which the whole country to which 
the Indian title was supposed to be extinguished, was di- 
vided between the members of the court [Francis Bosseron, 
Louis Edeline, Pierre Gameline, Pierre Querez] : and orders 
to that effect entered on their journal, each member absent- 
ing himself from the couil on the day that the order was to 
be made in his favor, so that it might appear to be the act 
of his fellows only. The. tract thus disposed of extends on 
the Wabash twenty-four leagues from La Pointe Coupee to 
the mouth of White river, and forty leagues into_the country 
west, and thirty east from the Wabash, excluding only the 
land immediately surrounding this town, which had before 
been granted to the amount of twenty or thirty thousand 
acres.' 

The authors of this ridiculous transaction soon found that 
no advantage could be derived from it, as they could find no 
purchasers, and I believe that the idea of holding any part 
of the land was by the greater part of them abandoned a few 
years ago; however, the claim was discovered, and a part of 
it purchased by some of those speculators who infest our 
country, and through these people, a number of others in dif- 
ferent parts of the United States have become concerned, 
some of whom are actually preparing to make settlements 
on the land the ensuing spring. Indeed, I should not be sur- 
prised to see five hundred families settling under these titles 
in the course of a year. The price at which the land is sold 



 

enables any body to become a purchaser; one thousand acres 
being frequently given for an indifferent horse or a I'ifle 
gun. A]id as a formal deed is made i-eciting the gi'ant of 
the court (made as it is pretended under the authority of 
the State of Virginia) many ignorant persons have been in- 
duced to part with their little all to obtain this ideal prop- 
erty, and they will no doubt endeavor to strengthen their 
claim, as soon as they have discovered the deception, by an 
actual settlement. The extent of these speculations was un- 
known to me until lately. I am now informed that a num- 
ber of persons are in the habit of repairing to this place, 
where they purchase two or three hundred thousand acres 
of this claim, for which they get a deed properly authenti- 
cated and recorded, and then disperse themselves over the 
United States, to cheat the ignorant and credulous. In some 
measure, to check this practice, I have forbidden the recorder 
and prothonotary of this county from recording or authenti- 
cating any of these papers ; being determined that the official 
seals of the Territory shall not be prostituted to a purpose 
so base as that of assisting an infamous fraud. 

I have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect.

If this measure, is not effected, I apprehend some serious 
consequences. It has already become a subject of discussion 
among the people of the territory, whether an Indian is pun- 
ishable by our laws for a murder committed on their own 
lands, or on a road leading through their country ; the nega- 
tive of this question is strongly maintained by many; and, 
should it reach the Indians, it will be no longer safe to pass 
the roads which connect the several settlements of the Ter- 
ritory. I have taken much pains to find the drift of the 
talks, which the British agents in Canada so frequently send 
to the Indians residing within our limits. The report men- 
tioned in the postscript of my letter of the 3d December last. 



 

came from Mr. Wells/ the person who attended the Indian 
chiefs who were lately in Washington. I have since seen the 
chief who is said to have been the bearer of the talk alluded 
to. Upon my interrogating him, he denied that he had re- 
ceived any particular message from M'Kee,- the British su- 
perintendant for Indian affairs for Upper Canada, whom 
he acknowledged to have visited. But he made so many com- 
plaints of the usage which the Indians had received from 
the Americans, and some of them were of a nature so far 
above his capacity, that I am sure they must have been put 
into his mouth by the said M'Kee, or by some of the British 
merchants. — Among other grievances, he mentioned the high 
price of Indian goods, which he attributed entirely to the duty 
which was laid upon the importation of those goods at De- 
troit, and which he said was contrary to the practice under 
the British government, and intended to impoverish and re- 
duce the Indians. Indeed, other chiefs have frequently in- 
formed me that they had heard we resolved to destroy them, 
that we might take possession of their lands. This idea I am 
confident has been infused into their minds by the British 
agents or traders, which last enjoy every opportunity to 
prejudice the Indians against us. They have even attempted 
to make the Indians believe that the United States intended 
to destroy them by means of the small pox, which was to be 
communicated to them by the goods which they receive from 
us. I have never been able to fix the spreading of these lies 
upon any one of the traders, they manage their business with 
so much art ; but when I do make such discovery, I shall make 
an example of him, by instantly depriving him of his license, 
and sending him out of the Indian country. In order the 
better to find out what is going forward among the Indians, 
I have endeavored to attach some of the best informed traders 
to our interest ; but, generally speaking, they are unprincipled 
men, and entirely devoted to the British, by whom they are 
supplied with all their goods. Could this be otherwise — could

the valuable skin and fur trade which our territory supplies, 
be diverted to the ports of the United States, instead of 
Canada, it would not only give a handsome emolument to 
our merchants, and increase our revenue by the additional 
consumption of imported goods, but it would also confirm the 
dependence of the Indians upon us. The principal objection 
made by the traders to whom I have recommended the carry- 
ing of their furs and peltry to the ports of the United States, 
is, that there are none of our merchants who make the im- 
portation of Indian goods, or purchase of furs and peltry their 
business, and of course they are not always certain of making 
sale of their coinmodities, or of obtaining in return goods 
suitable for their purpose; both of which, they are sure of 
when they go to the British merchants, who are exclusively 
employed in this kind of traffic. 

Sec. of War to Harrison 

War Department, February 23d, 1802 

Dawson, Harrison, 3i 

Sir: It is the ardent wish of the President of the United 
States, as well from a principle of humanity, as from duty 
and sound policy, that all prudent means in our power should 
be unremittingly pursued for carrying into effect the benevo- 
lent views of congress relative to the Indian nations within 
the jurisdiction of the United States. The provisions made 
by congress, under the heads of intercourse with the Indian 
nations, and for establishing trading houses among them etc. 
have for their object, not only the cultivation and establish- 
ment of harmony and friendship between the United States 
and the different nations of Indians, but the introduction of 
civilization, by encouraging and gradually introducing the 
arts of husbandry and domestic manufactures among them. 
The President is more induced to continue to raise all the 
means in his power for effecting the foregoing object from 
the happy effects already produced in several of the Indian 
nations, by the zeal and industry of the agents among them. 

With a view of giving every assistance in the power of the 
executive, to the measures contemplated, relating to the In- 
dians generally, the President has considered it necessary 
to make the following regulations : 



 

That the Governors of the North Western, Indiana, and 
Mississippi territories, in their capacities as agents for In- 
dian affairs, will in future consider themselves as having the 
superintendence of all business relating to the Indians in their 
respective territories, and will from time to time call upon 
such sub-agents as may be appointed by the President of the 
United States to reside among the Indian nations within their 
respective territories, for such information as may be neces- 
sary for ascertaining any facts or circumstances relating to 
the said Indians, or the conduct of any such sub-agents, and 
for any other information which may be useful and proper; 
and to give all such sub-agents such instructions and advice 
from time to time, as may be found necessary and not in- 
compatible with the laws, or instructions given by the imme- 
diate direction of the President of the United States. 

The sub-agents and agents of the territories, vdll, in future, 
correspond with the respective governors of the territories in 
which they may be placed, and communicate generally with 
the depai'tment of war through that channel, and consider 
themselves under the general direction of the governors re- 
spectively. And temporary or sub-agents, or agents of fac- 
tories, will regularly make report, once, at least, in every 
three months to the governor and to the secretary of war, 
of all circumstances relating to the agencies, with a correct 
statement of all expenses incui-red under their direction, 
which report should be made from a journal, regularly and 
correctly kept by the sub-agents, of all accounts worth notic- 
ing, relating to disputes, complaints, misfortunes, etc. includ- 
ing likewise, whatever may relate to the progi-ess of civiliza- 
tion among the Indians, and such remarks as their knowl- 
edge may, from time to time, enable them to make, relating 
to the natural history of the country, the population and the 
particular manners of the inhabitants, and likewise of the 
increase or decrease of population. 

The agents of factories will make correct returns of the 
state of the factory, of the sales and receipts, etc. to the gov- 
ernor of the territory in which they shall respectively reside, 
once in three months, noticing all circumstances proper to 
communicate relating to the kind and quantities of goods 
wanted, from time to time, and \vill transmit a duplicate 
thereof to the secretary of war. 



 

Colonel [Benjamin] Hawkins and the agents of the fac- 
tories at Tellico in Tennessee, and in Georgia, will communi- 
cate immediately with the secretary of war as usual. 

I have the honor to be, with sentiments of esteem, your 
humble servant.

Harrison to Sec. of War 

February 26, 1802 
Daw&on, Harrison, 16-20 

Sir: 

The subject of tlie boundary line between us and the In- 
dians, has engaged my attention for some time past; and as 
I consider myself possessed of all the information relating to 
it which I am likely to obtain in this quarter, I have thought 
it best to state to you the result of my inquiries and reflections. 

If the obvious construction of the treaty of Greenville^ is 
to be taken as the ground upon which our claim to land in 
this country is to be supported, 1 believe it will be found to 
be much more extensive than is generally imagined. The tract 
which the United States may rightfully claim, extends on the 
Wabash from Point Coupee, 12 leagues above the mouth of 
White river, to 12 leagues below this town, and in width from 
the river on the east, 40 leagues, and on the west 30 leagues. 

The grant of the land is said to have been made to Mon- 
sieur De Vincennes, a captain in the French army, and the 
founder of the colony which bears his name, for the use of 
the French settlers, and although the instrument of convey- 
ance (if there ever was one in writing) is lost, the fact is 
ascertained not only by the testimony of all the old French 
inhabitants, but is completely authenticated by a clause in a 
subsequent deed, made by the Indians to the Wabash Com- 
pany in the year 1775, in which the bounds of the tract be- 
fore granted to the French are laid down, for the purpose 
of excepting it from the sale then about to be made. An 
extract from the said deed, which is on record here, is en- 

1. Greenville treaty, negotiated by Wayne Aug. 3, 1795 fixed the boundary be- 
ginning at the mouth of the Cuyahoga up that stream to the Tuscarawas branch of 
the Muskingum down it to Fort Lawrence, west to Loramie's store on the headwaters 
of the Miami ; thence to Fort Recovery, thence by direct line to the Ohio opposite the 
mouth of the Kentucky. Besides this there were 16 separate resei-vations around posts 
and portages in the Indian counti-y. State Papers, Indian Affairs, I, 562 



 

closed. Although our title to the land is thus clearly ascer- 
tained, I think it would be extremely impolitic to insist on 
taking the whole of it. I am not certain that the Indians 
would agree to it. At present I believe they have no idea 
of a claim being set up to that extent, and it is said that 
general Putnam gave them assurance when he assembled the 
Wabash chiefs at this place in 1793, that our claim would 
not be very extensive.- The right to the whole tract may 
be declared, but the lines which are to run from the two 
points on the Wabash above mentioned, may be extended no 
further than 10 or 12 leagues, on each side the river. This 
would readily be acceded to by the Indians and would make 
the settlements here sufficiently large. None of the Pianki- 
shaw chiefs (by which tribe all the former sales in this coun- 
try were made) attended the treaty of Greenville, and the 
Wea chiefs, who are said to have represented them, are all 
dead. 

At a council which was held here last summer, the subject 
of the boundary line was mentioned by the Piankishaw chiefs, 
and they expressed great uneasiness that the boundary line 
had not been ascertained, and at the reports which had been 
circulated amongst them, that the Americans meant to take 
from them all their country. They also said, that the settle- 
ments which had been formed on the south side of White 
river," were an encroachment upon them. I took this oppor- 
tunity to explain to them that part of the treaty of Green- 
ville which relates to this place, and assured them that an 
investigation would take place, in order to ascertain the ex- 
tent of country which had been actually conceded to the 
French. That from what I can leam, our claim on the 
Wabash was contained between Point Coupee and White 
river, but I could not deteiTnine how far it might extend on 
each side the river, — nor in what direction the lines would 
run from these two points; but if it should appear on in- 
vestigation, that it was the intention of their forefathers, 

2. General Rufus Putnam was sent by Washinerton to Vincennes in 1792 to try 
the tennper of the Wahash Indians. His elaborate instructions are in Sta. Pa. Indian 
Affairs. I, SjM. On the 27th of September 1792 he concluded a treaty of friendship. 
John Baptiste Mayee. a French trader produced a copy of the treaty referred to by 
Harrison but the Indians denied its validity. It is given in Sta. Pap. Ind. Affairs I, S38, 
bearing date of 1776. witnessed by St. Marie and Phillibert. 

3. Hazeltons. Robbs, Severns. Hargroves. Johnsons. Prides, Mileys. and Tislows were 
a few of the pioneers who had already settled on the south side of White river. 

.See histories of Pike. Gibson, and Daviess counties 



 

that the line should run from the mouth of White river up 
the channel of that river, instead of at right angles to the 
Wabash, that they would be paid for all the land on the south 
side of White river virhich had been included in our settle- 
ments and surveys. This explanation seemed satisfactory. 
It appears that all the Indians have understood that the claim 
to the land between Point Coupee and White river had been 
extinguished, and I believe they would readily agree that it 
should extend in depth on each side the river so far as to 
make a square of 24 leagues, which is the distance between 
the above-mentioned points. The remainder of their claim 
may be relinquished, and this liberality will authorize us to 
ask for an extension of our territory on the Illinois, if our 
claim in that country is not sufficiently large to prevent our 
settlement from being cramped. 

My views as to the boundary line in that quarter are, that 
it should commence at the mouth of the Illinois river, run 
up that river for 30 or 35 miles, thence by a line parallel to 
the course of the Mississippi, until it intersects at right angles 
a line to be drawn from a point opposite Cape St. Combs, 
which is on the west side of the Mississippi, and about 10 
miles below Kaskaskia. This would give a tract of country 
of 80 miles by 35, over almost the whole of which our settle- 
ments are now scattered. 

There are some other objects of importance which might 
be settled at the time the Indians meet upon the subject of 
the boundary line. I have before stated to you that none of 
the roads passing through one settlement to any other in 
this Territory were made fi-ee by treaty, admitting that free 
ingress and egress were contemplated at the time that the 
several tracts were ceded to the French. Yet this can, I 
should suppose, extend no further than the allowance of one 
road to the Ohio, and one to the Mississippi, but the extension 
of the settlements and the constant emigration from the Ohio 
to this place, and the countries on the Mississippi, make it 
necessary to have two or three main roads. The settlements 
which extend from the Great Miami to the Indian boimdaiy, 
running from the Kentucky river, will shoi-tly be attached 
to this territory, and will totally be cut off from a communi- 
cation with the seat of government unless we can have a 
new road; and the opening of those I presume ought not to 
be attempted without the consent of the Indians; this con- 



 

sent I am sure can be had, as well as permission to estab- 
lish small stations at the distance of 25 or 30 miles apart on 
the roads most used for the accommodation of travellers. 
Another object to be provided for is the security of the per- 
sons and property of the traders residing in the Indian coun- 
try. Frequent complaints have been made to me of robberies 
and personal injuries committed by the Indians on the trad- 
ers, and I know of no redress for them. 

In the treaty of Greenville the chiefs promised to take the 
traders under their protection, but there is no specific mode 
of redress pointed out. Their treatment of the traders shows 
that they consider them entirely at their mercy, and they do 
frequently rob and abuse them. This insecurity to the per- 
sons and properties of the traders is the reason that so few 
decent and respectable men are employed in the Indian trade, 
which, with a few exceptions, is in the hands of the greatest 
villains in the world, and the authors of all those falsehoods 
which so frequently agitate the Indians. 

The Sacks or Sackees, a considerable nation who reside 
between the Illinois river and the Mississippi, were not in- 
cluded in the treaty of Greenville. They sent deputies to 
agree to a cessation of hostilities the spring previous to the 
treaty, but by some accident or other, they mistook the time, 
and did not attend the treaty. They are now extremely de- 
sirous to be put on a footing with the other tribes, and re- 
ceive an annual present, and it appears reasonable that they 
should. There is another I'eason for including them in the 
treaty of Greenville. I have reasons to believe that several 
of the white persons and negroes who were taken during 
the wars are still in the possession of those people, particu- 
larly the son of a Mr. Tanner of Kentucky who is extremely 
desirous to recover him. 

To accomplish those objects I beg leave. Sir, respectfully 
to recommend to the President, that a deputation from each 
of the neighboring tribes, viz : the Delawares, Potawatamies, 
Miamis, Eel river Indians, Weas, Kickapoos, Sacks, and Kas- 
kaskias should be assembled early in the ensuing summer, 
and that some person on the part of the United States be 
empowered to agree with them on the permanent boundaries 
between theirs and the lands of the United States at this 
place and the Illinois, country. To obtain their consent to 
open the following roads, viz: one from the Ohio at or near 



 

tlie mouth of Pigeon creek to Vincennes ; one from the settle- 
ments between the Great Miami and the Indian boundary 
line to Vincennes ; and one from some convenient spot on the 
Ohio to Kaskaskia. 

To extend to the Sack nation the provisions of the treaty 
of Greenville. 

To provide for the security of the persons and properties 
of the traders residing in the Indian country, and the punish- 
ment of those who injui'e them. 

To obtain the consent of the Indians to establish houses of 
accommodation at the distance of twenty-five or thirty miles 
apart on the post road from Louisville to Vincennes, and 
thence to Kaskaskia. 

And should it be considered practicable, to make new ar- 
rangements of the annuities. The Kaskaskias, for instance, 
who have only fifteen or sixteen warriors, and the Pianki- 
shaws who are reduced twenty-five or thirty, receive each 
500 dollars, which is the sum allowed the Kickapoos, who 
have some hundreds. I think it possible to prevail upon 
those two tribes to give up 200 dollars each of their annuity, 
which may be added to those of the Kickapoos and Pota- 
watamie; or with the addition of another 100 dollars, make 
an annuity of 500 dollars for the Sacks. 

I am persuaded, Sir, that nothing can be done with re- 
spect to any of these objects but in a general assembly of 
the chiefs of all the tribes. There appears to be an agree- 
ment amongst them, that no proposition which relates to 
their lands can be acceded to without the consent of all the 
tribes; and they are extremely watchful and jealous of each 
other lest some advantage should be obtained in which they 
do not all participate. 

A general meeting of the chiefs has been long wished for, 
in order to settle some disputes which have arisen amongst 
them, which but for my interposition, would have terminated 
in war. These disputes cannot (on account of the jealousies 
above mentioned) be amicably adjusted but by the mediation 
of the United States. 

The meeting would be further beneficial, as it would give 
an opportunity of explaining to them the conditions of the 
treaties they have made with us, which are very imperfectly 
understood. 

I do not know of any pretensions to land on the part of 



 

individuals without the acknowledged boundary of the lands 
of the LInited States, but those which are made by the Illinois 
and Wabash companies ; these companies are composed nearly 
of the same persons, and their claims include almost the whole 
country between the Lakes, the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the 
Indian boundary line, running from the mouth of the Ken- 
tucky river to the northern boundary of the United States. 

A person attended at the treaty of Greenville on behalf of 
one or both of these companies, and as well as I can recol- 
lect (for I was at that time in the family of General Wayne) 
the subject was not brought before the Indians. It is I be- 
lieve, acknowledged that these purchases were unauthorized 
by any government. To remedy this the conveyance is made 
to the company or to the King of Great Britain. 

I can form no idea of the number of Indians that may at- 
tend at the proposed meeting; I shall, however, endeavor to 
make it as small as possible, and dismiss them as soon as the 
business can be done. I believe that the chiefs will endeavor 
to bring with them as large a retinue as possible, which some 
will do from ostentation, and some from apprehension of 
danger, several of the tribes being much irritated against each 
other. 

I think it would be better to have the meeting immediately 
after the delivery of the annuities at Fort Wayne; no other 
presents will then be expected, excepting a few special ones 
for the chiefs. Should the President approve of giving an 
annuity to the Sacks, they will probable expect to have an 
advance of one year on their arrival here. One of the chiefs 
of this tribe attended the trial of the Delaware Indian at 
Kaskaskia last fall, and complained heavily of the neglect 
with which his tribe was treated by the United States. 

I have enclosed a sample of virgin copper, found on the 
Vermillion river, about eighty miles above this place. This 
piece has undergone no process excepting that of being heated 
in a common fire, and then beaten with a hammer to get off 
some small bits of stone and earth which adhered to it. I 
have reason to suppose that there is a considerable quantity 
at the place whence this piece was brought. Recollecting that 
there was a resolution of congress, passed two years ago, 
directing a search to be made after copper on Lake Superior, 
it occurred to me that the President might wish some in- 
quiries to be made after the mine from which this sample 
was taken. 



 

Harrison to the Secretary of War 

March 25, 1802 
Dawson, Harrison, 29 
With respect to the salt spring [in Sahne county, 111.] 
which the chiefs who were at the seat of government lately 
expressed a wish to lease, my opinion is, that it would be 
altogether improper to comply with their request, consider- 
ing both the present advantage of the Indians and the in- 
terests of the white settlers, now and in time to come. The 
spring alluded to, is perhaps the very best in the whole ex- 
tent of country from the Alleghany mountains to the Mis- 
sissippi, and may, if the preservation of the wood in the 
neighborhood be properly attended to, give so large a supply 
of salt as very considerably to reduce the price of that indis- 
pensable article in all the settlements of the Ohio and the 
navigable branches of that river. Should the proposed lease 
take place, the tenant would endeavor to make as much pres- 
ent advantage as possible — the young trees and the branches 
of the older would alone be made use of, while the heavy 
trunks would be left to rot on the ground, and in a few years 
would be effected the destruction of as much timber as would 
be sufficient, under proper management to last for a century. 
The leasing of this spring would probably produce a disagree- 
ment among the Indians themselves. Every tribe in the 
country would expect to partake in the benefits of the lease, 
and the proportion which would fall to the lot of each would 
be so small, as to disgust those who really have a right to 
the land : the Delawares and Shawnese have none. The bet- 
ter plan appears to be to extinguish the title altogether to 
the spring and a small tract around it: the United States 
could very well afford to give each of the tribes a sum equal 
to one year's annuity for the spring and 10,000 acres around 
it. It might then be put under such management as com- 
pletely to indemnify the public for the expense of the pur- 
chase, and produce a sufficiency of salt at a moderate price 
for the present inhabitants and those who are to follow.^ 

1. The Salines weie just below the mouth of the Wabash. Some Shawnee and 
Delaware chiefs on a visit to Washinston offered to cede these to the U. S. This was 
done and on January 18. 1803 Jefferson in a special message advised Congress to cari-y 
out the plan here suHeested by Harrison. April 30, 1805, Harrison appointed Col. 
Isaac White supt. of the Salt Works on Saline creek.

Proclamation: Pjghts of Settlers at Peoria 

April 8, 1802 
Executive Journal, 5 

The Citizens of the Village of Peoria on the Illinois River 
having presented a petition to the Governor, stating that a 
considerable quantity of wood and prairie land adjoining the 
said Village, from whence they have been accustomed to pro- 
cure hay and fuel, had been granted by a Certain Mallier 
[Paulette Maillet] who stiled himself Commandant of Peoria 
to a number of Individuals by whom the said Citizens have 
been forbidden to Cut Wood, or Hay as usual, to their great 
Inconvenience and Injuiy; The Governor Issued a proclama- 
tion publicly notifying, that all the land included within a 
Square of six miles [Ceded by Indians in Wayne's treaty, 
1795] round the said Village is the property of the United 
States, that the said Mallier nor no other persons have ever 
been authorized by the United States to dispose of the land, 
and that the sales, and Concessions made by him are Fraudu- 
lent and Void; And as the only agent of the United States 
in this Territory, he gave to the Citizens of the said Village 
permission to Cut wood and Hay upon any of the Public 
lands, which are not Enclosed or have not been yearly En- 
closed, at the same time he expressly forbids any new settle- 
ment, plantation or farm to be made upon any part of the 
said six miles square, until it shall be authorized by the Gov- 
ernment of the United States.^ 

Proclamation: Offering a Rev^ard for a Jail Breaker

Effected his Escape, the Governor Issued a proclamation of- 

1. Paulette Maillet was born at Macinac in 1753. His life was that of the French 
woods ranger, roamins the forest as an Indian partisan from Lake Erie to the Rocky 
mountains. He is best known for his daring capture of Fort St. Joseph in 1778. This 
same year he founded Peoria. 111., opposite the present city. Here in 1805 the trader 
lost his life in a cuiarrel with another ranger named Senegal who shot him dead. 



 

feriiig a Reward oi' three hundred DoHars, to any person or 
persons, who should apprehend the said WiHiams, and de- 
liver him to the Custody of the Sheriff of said County, he 
also in the same proclamation Charges and requires all Sher- 
iffs, Constables, and other Civil officers of the Territory to 
make diligent search for the said Culprit; and he requests 
the good Citizens of the Territory to give all the assistance 
in their power towards apprehending him, and as there is 
great reason to believe the said Williams was assisted by 
some Villian or Villians in making his Escape, the Governor 
offers a further reward of one hundred dollars, to any per- 
son or persons who will give information of any accomplice 
or accomplices of the said Williams in Breaking the Jail so 
that the offenders may be prosecuted with effect.^

Sir: 

The mail which will carry this letter is the first from this

have done myself the honour to write to you — altho I had 
nothing material to communicate. This barrenness of events 
still continues, with the exception of such as come under my

The Secretary of this Terretory will transmit you a Copy 
of our proceeings from the commencment of the Government

Gallaway were hunting on Blue river. They had about $50 worth of fur when their 
camp was discovered by three white wretches named John Williams, Martin Williams 
and a man named Cutchelow who murdered all the Indians and escaped with the 
plunder to Kentucky. On the order of the Governor of Kentucky Captain Davis Floyd 
arrested John Williams in Breckini-idge county. Kentucky. Cutchelow was rescued by 
his neighbors from the sheriff and Mai-tin Williams escaped to New Orleans. John 
Williams was lodged in jail at Vincennes where he broke jail by the aid of friends and 
escaped, as shown in the proclamation. The criminals escaped conviction but were 
all killed by the Indians a short time later while on a trapping expedition. See Harrison

this purpose. If I am correct will you please to ini'orin me, 
Sir, whether it will be done under your direction at the seat 
of Government, or will you authorise me to employ some one of 
the printers in Kentucky to do this and other trifling articles 
in the Printing line — Such as land Patents, Civil and Mili- 
tary Commissions &c. The Citizens of the Territory suffer 
great inconveniance for the want of Printed Laws — & I shall 
shortly be ready to issue Patents for such of the land claims 
as have not been decided on by the former Governor. My 
proceeding on this subject shall be transmitted to you as it 
is brought to a close — which I hope to be able to effect in 
the course of one year from the present time. My labour in 
this business would be much lightened and the chance of 
making blunders rendered much less ; If I could procure from 
Governor St. Clair certain Records in his possession, which 
exclusively relate to the land business in this Country. I 
liave enclosed an extract of his answer to my application for 
these papers, in which he declares he does not think himself 
authorised to deliver them, without an order for that purpose 
from the President.' 

I am with respect &c.

Sir: 

When I had the honour to see you in Philadelphia in the 
Spring of the year 1800 You were pleased to recommend to 
me a plan for a Town which you supposed would exempt its 
inhabitants in a great degree from those dreadful pestilences 
which have become so common in the large Cities of the 
United States. As the laws of this Territory have given to 
the Governor the power to designate the seats of Justice for 
the Counties, and as the choice of the Citizens of Clark 
County was fixed upon a spot where there had been no town 
laid out, I had an opportunity at once of gratifying them, 
of paying respect to your recommendation, and of Conform- 
ing to my own inclinations. The proprietor of the land hav- 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 51 

ing acceded to my proposals a Town has been laid out with 
each alternate square to remain vacant forever (excepting 
one Range of squares upon the River) and I have taken the 
liberty to call it Jeffersonville. The beauty of the spot on 
which the Towti is laid out, the advantage of the situation 
(being just above the Rapids of the Ohio) and the excellence 
of the plan, make it highly probable that it will at some 
period not very remote become a place of considerable Con- 
sequence. At the sale of the lots a few days ago several of 
them were struck off at 200 Dollars. It is in contemplation 
to cut a canal round the Rapids on this side — a pi'oject which 
it is said can be very easily executed and which will be highly 
beneficial to the To^^^l. Indeed I have very little doubt of 
its flourishing. It is my ardent wish that it may become 
worthy of the name it bears, and that the Humane & benevo- 
lent views which dictated the plan may be reallised. 

If Sir it should again happen that in the wide Range which 
you suffer your thoughts to take for the benefit of mankind 
the accomplishment of any of your wishes can in the smallest 
degree be aided by me, I beg you to believe that your Com- 
mands shall be executed to the utmost extent of my small 
talents. 

I have the Honour to be with sincere Attachment Sir your 
Most

Pile, Davis Floyd and Samuel Gwathmey. The plan of Jefferson was carried out. 
"The original plan resembled a checkerboard : the black squares to be sold in lots, the 
red squares to be crossed diagonally by sti-eets, leaving four triangular parks at the 
intersections of streets." This plan was changed in 1810.

Harrison's Address to Indian Council' 

August 12, 1802 

Dawson, Hwrrison, 22-25 

My Children — 

I have been, for a considerable time, desirous of having 
a general council composed of the chiefs and wise men of all 
the different tribes, whose concerns have been committed to 
my management, by your great father, the President of the 
United States. 

Since my first arrival in this country, you well know how 
extremely anxious I have been to preserve your peace and 
harmony, not only between you and your white brethren, but 
between each particular tribe of my red children. 

When the tomahawk was raised some time ago by some of 
your inconsiderate and rash young men, and your blood al- 
ready began to flow, you know what pains I took to arrest 
the fury of the bloody weapon and to bury it where I thought 
it could never again be found. 

My children, the great tree of peace which was planted at 
Greenville, I have watered and cultivated with the greatest 
care, and I have cherished the hope that this tree would 
spread its branches over the whole of this great Island,, and 
that the white and red people would smoke the pipe of friend- 
ship under its shade till the end of time. 

But in spite of all my care, this fair and flourishing tree 
has been severely wounded by the rash and inconsiderate 
young men of both colors; and but a very few weeks ago, 
it received a most terrible gash, and one, which I much fear, 
will endanger the very existence of those large branches 
which hang over the Illinois river. 

My Children, let us all exert ourselves to shield from future 
danger this sacred plant: let us cut off the branches which 
are withered and decayed, and extirpate the weeds which 
have hitherto retarded its growi;h, and then let us entwine 
our arms around its trunk, that the vicious and unruly may 
be unable to injure it. 

My Children whilst your father, the President, was form- 

1. This council was called at Vincennes and got to business September 2. Kas- 
kaskias. Kickapoos, Weas, Eel river Miamies, Piankeshaws and Pottawattomies attended. 
Compare the letter from the Sec. of War, Feb. 23. 1802. and Harrison's letters of 
Feb. 26. above for pui-pose. See also the report of this council under date of Sep- 
tember 17, 1802. 



 

ing plans for your future happiness, and was communicating 
to me his directions upon the subject of clearing your under- 
standings, and making- you acquainted with those arts by 
which the white people are enabled to live with so much ease 
and comfort, how much must he have been grieved and sur- 
prised to hear that two of his people had been murdered by 
some of those very persons for whose welfare and happiness 
his thoughts were thus anxiously employed. Are these de- 
lightful plains, which were made by the Great Spirit to 
afford nourishment for his children, to be for ever deluged 
with blood? Will foolish men never learn that war and 
bloodshed are as offensive to the maker of us all, as they are 
destructive of the happiness of those which might engage 
in it? 

Mt/ Childrev, aim your arrows at the buffaloe, the bear, and 
the deer, which are provided for your use, but spare your 
brother man ; let those whom the Great Spirit has placed upon 
the same Island, live in peace with each other. Let the na- 
tions to whom it has pleased God to give abundance of the 
comforts of life, share them with their neighbors who may 
be deficient. 

My Children, by this principle your great father, the Presi- 
dent of the United States is strongly actuated; he bids me 
inform you that it is his ardent wish to see you prosperous 
and happy; he has directed me to take every means in my 
power to have you instructed in those arts, which the Great 
Spirit has long ago communicated to the white people, and 
from which they derive food and clothing in abundance. 

My Children, some of you whom I now address are old and 
wise men, who have lived long enough to see that the kind of 
life you lead is neither productive of happiness to yourselves, 
nor acceptable to the Great Spirit. You know the constant 
state of warfare in which you have lived has reduced some 
of your most powerful nations to a mere handful ; and even 
in time of peace, the difficulty of procuring provisions at some 
seasons of the year is so great, that your women are unable 
to raise a sufficient number of children to supply the constant 
waste occasioned by the excessive use of that most pernicious 
liquor, whiskey. 

My Children, the Great Spirit must assuredly have been 
angry with us when he discovered to man the mode of making 



 

this mischievous liquor. You well know the innumerable 
miseries which this fatal liquor has produced amongst you. 
Many of your young men spend the whole profit of their 
hunting in whiskey, and their children and old fathers are 
left to struggle with cold and hunger. Nay more, when 
reason is driven away by the intoxicating draft — what shock- 
ing scenes have been exhibited. The knife of a brother is 
aimed at a brother's life, and the tomahawk of the son is 
frequently buried in the head of his father; and those beau- 
tiful plains which were only to be stained by the blood of 
the deer and buffaloe are crimsoned with the gore of your 
best chiefs and warriors. 

But my Children, let us turn away our eyes from those 
shocking scenes, and let us unite our endeavors to introduce 
other manners amongst the generation which is now grow- 
ing up. 

Your father, the President, has directed me to inform you, 
that he wishes you to assemble your scattered warriors, and to 
form towns and villages, in situations best adapted to culti- 
vation; he will cause you to be furnished with horses, cattle, 
hogs, and implements of husbandry, and will have persons 
provided to instruct you in the management of them. My 
children, turn your thoughts seriously to this important ob- 
ject. You know that the game which afforded you subsis- 
tence is yearly becoming more scarce, and in a short time 
you will be left without resource, and your wives and chil- 
dren will in vain ask you for food. 

My Children, it is very easy for you to avoid this calamity. 
A great many years ago the white people subsisted as you do 
now upon the wild beasts of the forest. When those were 
becoming scarce the Great Spirit communicated to them the 
method of raising grain for bread, and taught them to bring 
the ox and the horse under their subjection though they had 
been as wild as your deer and buffaloe and thus to assist 
them in cultivating the earth. 

My Children, our Great Father, who lives in heaven has 
admirably contrived this earth for the comfort and happiness 
of his children ; but from the beginning he has made it a 
law that man should earn his food by his own exertions : the 
beasts of the forest cannot be taken without trouble and 
fatigue ; nor can bread or clothing be made without consider- 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 55 

able labor. It is necessary that the grain should be deposited 
in the earth, and the intruding beasts kept oft' and noxious 
weeds destroyed ; the munificent Deity performs the rest. He 
sends the rain and the dew to fertilize the soil and give vigor 
to the tender plants, and causes the sun to ripen and perfect 
the fruit. 

There is nothing so pleasing to God as to see his children 
employed in the cultivation of the earth. He gave command 
to our ancestors to increase and multiply until the whole 
earth should be filled with inhabitants. But you must be 
sensible my Children that this command could not be obeyed 
if we were all to depend upon the chase for our subsistence. 
It requires an immense extent of country to supply a very 
few hunters with food, and the labor and fatigue which the 
wives of hunters undergo and their constant exposure to the 
inclemency of the seasons make the raising of a very few 
children a matter of the greatest difiiculty. 

My Children, you may perhaps think that the plan I have 
recommended is too difilcult to be effected; but you may de- 
pend upon it that with the proper exertions on your part 
there is no doubt of its success. The experiment has been 
fairly tried with your brothers the Creeks and Cherokees. 
Many individuals of the former have herds of cattle con- 
sisting of some hundreds together with an abundance of corn 
and vegetables. This has had a most happy effect on their 
population and all their wigwams are already filled with 
children. 

At any rate let me entreat you to make the experiment, 
for the sake of the rising generation ; although it may be dif- 
ficult for an old man to change entirely the mode of life in 
which he has been brought up, with children it is otherwise ; 
they can be formed to any thing, can be made to assume any 
shape like the young shoots of the willow or the tender 
branches of the vine.

Proclamation: Selling Liquor to Indians 

October 24, 1802 

Executive Journal, 7 

The Congress of the United States having by the act of 
the 30th March, 1802, authorized the President of the United 
States to take such measures as he may deem Expedient for 
preventing the Introduction of ardent Spirits amongst the 



 

Indian Tribes, and the (iosernor of the Territory having re- 
ceived Instructions and authority Irom the President to sup- 
press the sale of ardent Spirits to the Indians within the Ter- 
ritory, The Governor Issued his proclamation strictly En- 
joining upon all traders and other persons, to forbear in 
future to sell any ardent spirits or Intoxicating Liquors to 
any Indian or Indians whatever ; Such Traders as may here- 
tofore [have] taken Liquors into the Indian Country are 
allowed to remove the same after which period it shall be 
considered as an Infraction of the Regulations for the Gov- 
ernment of the Indian Department, if any such ardent spirits 
are found in their possession and their Bonds will be forfeited 
accordingly.

The white man and the Indian were drinking together at 
a tavern, a quarrel ensued, and the Indian was taken off by 
another white man to a distant house till he would became 
sober. The man with whom the Indian disputed, after pro- 
viding himself with a cudgel, proceeded to the house where 
the Indian was, and forced open the door of the room in 
which he lay, and beat him to death with the cudgel. He 
was apprehended, but there were strong doubts that a jury 
could not be procured that would convict him, although the 
evidence was indisputable ; such was the delusion under which 
the white inhabitants labored with respect to the crime of 
murdering an Indian. (Extract) 

Proclamation: Calling a Convention to Petition Con-

November 22, 1802 

Executive Journal, 7 

Petitions having been presented to the Governor by a Con- 
siderable number of the Citizens of the Territory praying 
that a proclamation should Issue from the Executive author- 
ity for Calling a General Convention for the purpose of taking 
into consideration the propriety of repealing the sixth article 



 

of Compact between the United States and the people of the 
Territory, and for other purposes, and proof having been 
adduced to the governor that a very large majority of the 
Citizens are in favor of the measures : the Governor in Com- 
pliance with their wishes Issued his proclamation notifying 
all whom it may concern that an Election will be held at 
the Respective Court Houses in Each County of the Terri- 
tory on Tuesday the 11th. day of December for Choosing 
representatives to a General Convention, and the number of 
Representatives from the several Counties to be as follows 
Viz. from the County of Knox four, from the County of Ran- 
dolph three, from the County of St. Clair three, and from 
the County of Clark two, and the Sheriffs of the several Coun- 
ties are authorized and required to hold the Elections in 
their Respective Counties, and in Case of any of the Sheriffs 
are Candidates, then the election to be held by the Coroners.'

Indiana Historical Societjj PHbiieations, II, ir,9 
We the People of Indiana Territory inhabiting the middle 
and western Divisions of the Country Northwest of the Ohio, 
do by our Representatives in general Convention assembled, 
hereby agree that the operation of the Sixth Article of Com- 
pact between the United States and the people of the Terri- 
tory [Ordinance of 1787] should be suspended for the space 
of ten years from the Day that a law may be passed by Con- 
gress giving their Consent to the Suspension of the said 
Article. 

1. By a subsequent proclamation, dated November 24, the time for opening this 
convention was changed to Monday, December 20th, Executive Journal, 7, at which time 
it duly met. On December 25th the convention adopted a resolution in favor of a 
ten year suspension of the article of the Ordinance of 17S7 which prohibited slavery: 
and on the 28th the substance of this resolution, toKether with some additional requests 
concerning the errant of lands, provisions for education, roads, salt sprincrs. the franchise, 
etc., was embodied in a petition to Congress, which was transmitted to that body by the 
Govei-nor with an accompanying letter on the same day. An advei-se report to the 
request concerning slavery (and most of the other matters) was returned in the House 
of Representatives by a committee presided over by John Randolph, on March 2, 1803; 
but a year later (Febniary 17, 1804) a second committee reported in favor of it. The 
desired authorization for the introduction of slavery, however, was not obtained, either 
at this time or later, when the petition was several times renewed. The documents cited 
above are here printed as necessary to an understanding of this proclamation.

( 

Provided however that should no law be passed by Con- 
gress for suspending the said article before the 4th day of 
March 1805, then the Consent of the people of this Territory 
hereby given shall be void and of no effect. [See Nov. 22,

Petition of the Vincennes Convention 

December 28, 1802- 

Indiana Historical Society Publications, II, J,lil 

That nine-tenths of your memorialists being of opinion, 
that the sixth article of Compact contained in the ordinance 
for the Government of the Territory has been extremely 
prejudicial to their Interest and welfare, requested the Gov- 
ernor by petitions from each of the several counties to call 
a general convention of the Territory for the purpose of tak- 
ing the sense of tlie whole People by their Representatives 
on a subject to them so interesting and of afterwai-ds taking 
such measures as to them might seem meet by petition to 
your honorable Bodies not only for obtaining the repeal or 
suspension of the said article of Compact but also for that of 
representing and Petitioning for the passage of such other 
Laws as would in the opinion of the Convention be conducive 
to the general welfare, population and happiness of this dis- 
tant and unrepresented portion of the United States. 

This convention is now sitting at Vincennes and have 
agreed to make the following representations to the Congress 
of the United States, not in the least doubting but that every- 
thing they can desire (not prejudicial to the Constitution or 
to the Interest of the General Government) will readily be 
granted them. 

The Sixth article of Compact between the United States 



 

and the people of the Territory which declares that there 
shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in it has 
prevented the Country from populating and been the reason 
of driving many valuable Citizens possessing Slaves to the 
Spanish side of the Mississippi, most of whom but for the 
prohibition contained in the ordinance would have settled in 
this Territory, and the consequences of keeping that prohibi- 
tion in force will be that of obliging the numerous Class of 
Citizens disposed to emigrate, to seek an Asylum in that 
country where they can be permitted to enjoy their property. 

Your memorialists however and the people they represent 
do not wish for a repeal of the article entirely, but that it 
may be suspended for the Term of Ten Years and then to 
be again in force, but that the slaves brought into the Ter- 
ritory during the Continuance of this Suspension and their 
progeny, may be considered and continued in the same state 
of Servitude, as if they had remained in those parts of the 
United States where Slavery is permitted and from whence 
they may have been removed. 

Your memoralists beg leave further to represent, That the 
quantity of lands in the Territory open for Settlement is by 
no means sufficiently large to admit of a population adequate 
to the purposes of Civil Government. They therefore pray 
that the Indian titles to the land lying between the settled 
part of the Illinois country and the Ohio, between the general 
Indian boundary line running from the mouth of the river 
Kentucky [Greenville Treaty Line] and the tract commonly 
called Clark's Grant [Clark County, Indiana] and between 
and below the said Clark's Grant and the Ohio and Wabash 
Rivers, may be extinguished ; and as an incouragement for 
a speedy population of the Country; that those lands and all 
other public lands in the Territory may be sold in Smaller 
Tracts and at a lower price than is now allowed by the exist- 
ing Laws. A purchase of most of the Country above men- 
tioned but more especially of that part lying between the 
Illinois and the Ohio it is conceived may be easily obtained 
from the Indians and on very moderate and advantageous 
Terms. 

Several persons (as your memoralists are informed) hav- 
ing settled on the public lands in this Territory with the 
intention of purchasing the same when offered for sale by 
the United States are fearful that advantages may be taken 



 

of their Improvements to enhance the Price. Your Peti- 
tioners therefore pray, That a law may be passed for their 
relief, giving the right of Pre-emption to all those who may 
have so settled on the public lands, and also as one of the 
more sure means of populating the Country as of enhancing 
the value of the United States lands remaining undisposed 
of in the Territory. They further pray, that provision may 
be made in the said Law for securing a certain part of every 
Section of Such public land to those who will actually settle 
and cultivate the same. 

The United States having pledged themselves in the Ordi- 
nance that Schools and the means of Education should be 
forever encouraged, and having in all the Sales of land here- 
tofore made, reserved considerable portions thereof for that 
purpose. 

Your memorialists, therefore, humbly pray that a law may 
be passed making a grant of lands for the support of the 
Schools and Seminaries of learning to the several Settlements 
in the Illinois, the Settlement of Vincennes, and that of 
Clark's Grant, near the Rapids of the Ohio. 

The means of communication as well between the several 
Settled parts of the Territory as between the Territory and 
the State of Kentucky, being extremely difficult and incon- 
venient, as well for want of good Roads as for want of houses 
of Entertainment, and as neither of those objects can be ob- 
tained otherwise than by application to the United States 
who own or may own the lands through which the said Roads 
must pass. 

Your memorialists, therefore, further pray that a law may 
be enacted granting to such persons as the Governor of the 
Territory may recommend, Four hundred acres of land to 
each in such places as the said Governor may designate, not 
exceeding the distance of Twenty miles from each other, on 
the road leading from Clark county to Knox county, and from 
Vincennes in the said County to the Bank of the Ohio oppo- 
site to the town of Henderson, in Kentucky: also from Vin- 
cennes to Kaskaskia, in Randolph county, and from thence 
to Lusk's Ferry on the Ohio [15 miles above the mouth of 
Cumberland river], who will open good waggon roads and 
Establish houses of Entertainment thereon for Five Years, 
under such restrictions as to your Wisdom may Seem Neces- 
sary. 



 

And your Memorialists further beg leave to represent that 
one of the most indispensable articles of life (Salt) is very 
Scarse and difficult to be obtained, That for the want of a 
sufficient number of Salt Springs in their Country, that dif- 
ficulty must increase with the population, and if effectual 
methods are not taken to secure the Timber in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Salt Springs [near Shawneetown] from be- 
ing willfully or carelessly wasted and destroyed, they will in 
a very few years indeed be utterly destitute of that very valu- 
able article; that there is but one Salt Spring known in the 
Country of any value, and that is situate below the mouth of 
the Wabash River, Commonly called the Saline, and is very 
advantageously placed for the accommodation of most of the 
Inhabitants of the Territory, and has, moreover, been lately 
ceded by the Indians to the general Government. 

Your memoralists, therefore, humbly pray the Congress of 
the United States to extend their Bounty to this Territory 
as they have lately done to that Northwest of the Ohio, and 
vest the said Salt Spring in the Legislature of the Territory, 
as soon as it is formed in trust, for. the use of the Territory, 
and untill the Legislature be fornied, that the management 
of said spring be committed to the Governor of the Terri- 
tory, or to such other person as the President of the United 
States may think proper to appoint. 

By a Resolve of Congress of the 29th August, 1788, con- 
firmed by an Act of the United States of the 3d March, 1791, 
a donation of Four hundred acres of land is given to each 
of those persons who were heads of Families in the Illinois 
Country on or before the year 1783, which the Governor of 
the Territory was directed to cause to be laid oflF to the sev- 
eral claimants in a form of a Parallelogram adjoining the 
several Villages therein mentioned. 

The whole of the lands adjoining those Villages were be- 
fore the passage of the above Resolve the private property 
of Individuals who claimed the same by Virtue of old grants 
made to them and their ancestors during the time of the 
French government so that the Governor could not cause the 
said donation to be laid off in the form and manner desig- 
nated by the said Resolve. 

This has been very detrimental to the several Grantees, and 
in a great measure prevented the further population of the 
Country, your memorialists however beg leave to observe. 



 

that if the said donation lands are directed to be laid off in 
distinct Bodies for each Village, by far the greatest part of 
them must from the very large and extensive Prairies with 
which the whole of that country abounds be wholly and abso- 
lutely useless through the entire want of Timber. 

Your memoralists therefore pray you to take the situation 
of the antient Inhabitants of the Illinois Country into Con- 
sideration and as the humane Intention of Congress was to 
give such lands as would be useful, that you will permit the 
said Grantees, their Heirs and assigns especially after a 
period of Fourteen years, to locate their said donation of Four 
hundred acres of land in separate Tracts, in such parts of 
the Illinois Country to which the Indian titles may have been 
extinguished, and that the Governor of the Territory may be 
authorized to issue Patents therefor. This permission to lo- 
cate the lands in separate Tracts, will not it is conceived be 
prejudicial to the United States, as the value of the lands in 
the neighbourhood of each Settled Tract will thereby be con- 
siderably augmented. 

Your memorialists further shew that they view that part 
of the ordinance for the Government of the Territory which 
requires a freehold qualification in fifty acres of land as 
Electors for members to the general assembly as subversive 
of the liberties of the Citizens and tending to throw too great 
a weight in the Scale of wealth. They therefore pray that 
the right of Suffrage (in voting for representatives to the 
general assembly) may be extended to the free male Inhabi- 
tants of the Territory of the age of Twenty one years and 
upwards, but under such Regulations and Restrictions as to 
you in your Wisdom may seem proper. 

Since the Erection of the Territory into a separate Gov- 
ernment, the Attorney General [John Rice Jones] therof has 
prosecuted not only for offenses committed against the 
Municipal Laws of the Territory but also against the Laws 
of the United States, and has been obliged at three different 
Times to travel one hundred and sixty miles, from his home 
to the seat of the Territorial Government to prosecute of- 
fenders against those Laws, and yet he has received no Com- 
pensation for his Services either from the United States or 
the Territory, nor is it probable that the Territory can afford 
to allow him any Salary for his future services. 

Your memorialists, therefore, pray that a Law may be 



 

passed allowing a Salary to the Attorney-General of the Ter- 
ritory adequate to the important services which are ren- 
dered by that officer to the United States as well as to the 
Territory. 

Your memorialists are well aware that the consideration 
of the numerous objects contemplated by this memorial will 
require more time than can well be spared from the impor- 
tant and general concenis of the Union, but when they reflect 
upon their neglected and orphan-like Situation they are em- 
boldened to hope that their wants and wishes will meet with 
all the indulgence and attention necessary to secure to them 
the relief which is so essential to their welfare and happiness.

Proclamation : Erecting the Lower Peninsula of Michi- 
gan INTO Wayne County, and Attaching the Whitewater 
Valley to Clark County 

January 14, 1803 

Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society, Collections VIII, 5JtO 

Whereas, By an act of Congress passed the 30 of April 
1802 entitled "An act to enable the people of the Eastern 
Division of the Territory North West of the River Ohio, to 
form the constitution and State Government and for the ad- 
mission of such state into the Union on an equal footing with 
the original states and for other purposes". It is declared 
that from and after the formation of the said states, all that 
part of that part North v^^estern territory which is not included 
within the boundaries prescribed for the said state shall be 
attached to, and made part of the Indiana Territory ; 

and whereas the inhabitants of the said Eastern division 
have formed themselves into an independent state by the 
name of the State of Ohio it has become necessary for the 
convenience of the citizens in the newly acquired territory 
and the due administration of justice that a new county 
should be laid off and alterations made in the boundaries of 
those formerly established. 

Wherefore I William Henry Harrison Governor of the In- 
diana Tei-ritory by the authority vested in me by the ordi- 
nance for the Government of the Territory, do ordain and 
declare that a county shall be formed in the North-eastern 
part of the Territory to be known and designated by the 
name and style of the County of Wajnie. And the boundaries 
of the said county shall be as follows to wit: Beginning at 
a point where the East and West line passing through the 
Southerly extreme of Lake Michigan would intersect a North 
and South line passing through the most Westerly extreme 
of the said Lake, and thence north along the last mentioned 
line to the Territorial boundery of the United States, thence 
along the said boundry line to a point where an East and 
West line passing through the Southerly extreme of Lake 
Michigan would intersect the same, thence West along the 
last mentioned line to the place of beginning. — And all the 
aforesaid lands lying \^^thin the above described lines and 
boundaries are hereby erected into the county of Wayne. 
And the inhabitants of the said county of Wayne shall have 



 

and enjoy (from the date hereof) all the rights, privileges 
and immunities whatsoever which to a county and the in- 
habitants thereof in anywise appertain. — And each and every 
person within the bounds of said county of Wayne who held 
commissions civil or military under the government of the 
Northwestern territory at the time of the formation of the 
• State of Ohio, shall still continue to exercise and enjoy their 
respective offices. And the justices of the Court of common 
pleas; of the general quarter sessions of the peace, and of 
the orphans court shall (until otherwise directed) continue 
to hold their respective courts at the place and times at 
which they were accustomed to be held under the Govern- 
ment of the Northwestern Territory. 

And whereas I have not received sufficient information re- 
specting the settlements, below the great Miami, to enable me 
to form in that quarter a county establishment, for the present, 
tliat tract of country included between a North line drawn from 
the mouth of the big Miami River; the Ohio, and the Indian 
boundery line running from a point opposite to the mouth 
of the Kentucky River shall be attached to and form part of 
the county of Clark. And such persons within the said 
bounds as may have held civil or military commissions under 
the Government of the Northwestern Territory, at the time 
when the said described tract was attached to this territory, 
are hereby appointed to the same offices respectively in the 
County of Clark which they held under the Government of 
the Northwestern Territory.

Jefferson to Harrison 

Washington Feb. 27, 1803 
[Jefferson Papers 1st series, vol. 9 no. 208] 

Dawson, Harrison, 35-38 

Dear Sir: 

While at Monticello in August last I received your favor of 
Aug. 8 [see above] and meant to have acknowledged it on 



 

my return to the seat of government at the close of the en- 
suing month, but on my return I found that you were ex- 
pected to be on here in person, and this expectation continued 
till winter. I have since received your favor of Dec. 30. 

In the foi-mer you mentioned the plan of the town which 
you had done me the honour to name after me, and to lay 
out according to an idea I had formerly expressed to you. I 
am thoroughly persuaded that it will be found handsome, & 
pleasant, and I do believe it to be the best means of preserv- 
ing the cities of America from the scourge of the yellow 
fever which being peculiar to our country must be derived 
from some peculiarity in it, that peculiarity I take to be our 
cloudless skies. In Europe where the sun does not shine 
more than half the number of days in the year which it does 
in America, they can build their towns in a solid block with 
impunity; but here a constant sun produces too great an 
accumulation of heat to admit that. Ventilation is indis- 
pensably necessary. Experience has taught us that in the 
open air of the country the yellow fever is not only not gen- 
erated, but ceases to be infectious. I cannot decide from the 
drawing you sent me, whether you have laid off streets round 

the squares thus ;LJa^U.; or only the diagonal streets there- 
in marked. The ij^Uj^-i former was my idea, and is, I im- 
agine, more convenient. 

You will recieve herewith an answer to your letter as Presi- 
dent of the Convention ; and from the Secretary at War you 
recieve from time to time information and instructions as 
to our Indian affairs. These communications being for the 
public records are restrained always to particular objects and 
occasions. But this letter being unofficial, and private, I may 
with safety give you a more extensive view of our policy re- 
specting the Indians, that you may better comprehend the 
parts dealt out to you in detail through the official channel, 
and observing the system of which they make a part, con- 
duct yourself in unison with it in cases where you are obliged 
to act without instruction. [The] system is to live in per- 
petual peace with the Indians, to cultivate an affectionate 
attachment from them, by every thing just & liberal which 
we can [offer?] them within the bounds of reason, and by 
giving them effectual protection against wrongs from our own 
people. The decrease of game rendering their subsistence by 



 

hunting insufficient, we wish to draw them to agriculture, to 
spinning- and weaving. The latter branches they take up 
with great readiness, because they fall to the women, who 
gain by quitting the labours of the field [for] these which 
are exercised within doors. When they withdraw themselves 
to the culture of a small piece of land, they will perceive how 
useless to them are their extensive forests, and will be will- 
ing to pare them off. from time to time in exchange for neces- 
saries for their farms & families. To promote this disposi- 
tion to exchange lands which they have to spare and we 
want for necessaries, which we have to spare and they want, 
we shall push our trading houses, and be glad to see the good 
and influential individuals among them run in debt, because 
we observe that when these debts get beyond what the indi- 
viduals can pay, they become willing to lop them off by a 
cession of lands.' At our trading houses too we mean to 
sell so low as merely to repay cost and charges so as neither 
to lessen or enlarge our capital. This is what private traders 
cannot do, for they must gain; they will consequently retire 
from the competition, and we shall thus get clear of this pest 
without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians. In this 
way our settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach 
the Indians, and they will in time either incorporate with us 
as citizens of the United States or remove beyond the Mis- 
sisipi. The former is certainly the termination of their his- 
tory most happy for themselves. But in the whole course of 
this, it is essential to cultivate their love. As to their fear, 
we presume that our strength and their weakness is now 
so visible that they must see we have only to shut our hand 
to crush them, and that all our liberalities to them proceed 
from motives of pure humanity only. Should any tribe be 
fool-hardy enough to take up the hatchet at any time, the 
siezing the whole country of that tribe and driving them 
across the Missisipi, as the only condition of peace, would be 
an example to others, and a furtherance of our final con- 
solidation. 

1. Harrison has been ci-iticised by most writers dealinK with this period for his 
"aggressive" policy in purchasing Indian lands. This criticism began with dis- 
gruntled land speculators such as William Mcintosh. Dunn. Indiana 323-416 : "Decitis" 
Letters; Marshall, Historii of Kcnturl-ir, Adams, United States VI, 107; Alvord, The 
Illinois Country. 

For a similar case, see the attacl.s made on Michael Jones, land agent in Illinois, 
at the same time. The criticism plainly has no sufficient foundation. On the other 
hand compare Reynolds, Pioneer Illinois, 276, 280. 



 

Combined with these views, and to be prepared against 
the occupation of Louisiana by a powerful and enterprising 
people, it is important that setting less value on interior ex- 
tension of purchases fi'om the Indians, we bend our whole 
views to the purchase and settlement of the country on the 
Missisipi from it's mouth to it's Northern regions, that we 
may be able to present as strong a front on our Western as 
on our Eastern border, and plant on the Missisipi itself the 
means of it's own defence. We now own from 31° to the 
Yazoo, and hope this summer to purchase what belongs to 
the Choctaws from the Yazoo up to their boundary, supposed 
to be about opposite the mouth of Acanza [Arkansas]. We 
wish at the same time to begin in your quarter, for which 
there is at present a favorable opening. The Caskias [Kas- 
kaskias] being extinct, we are entitled to their country by our 
paramount sovereignty. The Peorias we understand have 
all been driven off from their country, and we might claim it 
in the same way; but as we understand there is one chief 
remaining, who would, as the survivor of the tribe, sell the 
right, it will be better to give him such terms as will make 
him easy for life, and take a conveyance from him. The Kas- 
kaskias being reduced to a few families, I presume we may 
purchase their whole country for what would place every 
individual of them at his ease, and be a small price to us: 
say by laying off for each family wherever they would chuse it 
as much rich land as they could cultivate, adjacent to each 
other, inclosing the whole in a single fence, and giving them 
such an annuity in money or goods for ever as would place 
them in happiness; and we might take them also under the 
protection of the United States. Thus possessed of the rights 
of these three tribes, we should proceed to the settling their 
boundaries with the Poutawatamies and Kickapoos; claiming 
all doubtful territory but paying them a price for the re- 
linquishment of their concurrent claims, and even prevailing 
on them if possible to cede at a price such of their o^\Tl un- 
questioned tei-ritory as would give us a convenient Northern 
boundary. Before broaching this, and while we are bargain- 
ing with the Kickapoos, the minds of the Poutawatamies and 
Kickapoos should be soothed and conciliated l)y liberalities 
and sincere assurances of friendship. Perhaps sending a well 
qualified character to stay some time in Decaigne's- village 

2. Where identifications do not follow immediately see index. 



 

as if on other business, and to sound him and introduce the 
subject by degrees to his mind and that of the other heads 
of families, inculcating in the way of conversation all those 
considerations which prove the advantages they would re- 
ceive by a cession on these tei-ms, the object might be more 
easily and effectually obtained than by abruptly proposing it 
to them at a formal treaty. Of the means however of ob- 
taining what we wish you will be the best judge ; and I have 
given you this view of the system which we suppose will best 
promote the interests of the Indians and of ourselves, and finally 
consolidate our whole country into one nation only, that you 
may be enabled the better to adapt your means to the object. 
For this purpose we have given you a general commission 
for treating. The crisis is pressing. Whatever can now be 
obtained, must be obtained quickly. The occupation of New 
Orleans, hourly expected, by the French, is already felt like 
a light breeze by the Indians. You know the sentiments they 
entertain of that nation. Under the hope of their protection, 
they will immediately stiffen against cessions of land to us. 
We had better therefore do at once what can now be done. 
I must repeat that this letter is to be considered as private 
and friendly, and not to controul any particular instructions 
which you may receive through an official channel. You will 
also percieve how sacredly it must be kept within your own 
breast, and especially how improper to be understood by the 
Indians. [For] their interests and their tranquillity it is 
best they should see only the present [stat]e of their history. 
I pray you to accept assurances of my esteem and considera- 
tion.

Randolph's Report on Slavery in Indiana 

March 2, 1803 

Am. St a. Pa. Public Lands, I, 161 

Mr. [John] Randolph, from the committed to whom were 
referred a letter from William Henry Harrison, President of 
the Convention, held at Vincennes, declaring the consent of 

1 . This House committee consisted of John Randolph of Va., Roger Griswold of 
Connecticut. Robert Williams of North Car., William Hoge of Penn.. and L. R. Morris 
of Vei-mont. It is worth keeping in mind that there was about as much opposition to 
slaveiT at this time in the south as in the north. For petitions see Nov. 22. 1802. above. 



 

the people of Indiana to the suspension of the sixth article 
of compact between the United States and the people of that 
territory : also, a memorial and petition of the inhabitants of 
the said territory; made the following report: 

"That the rapid population of the State of Ohio sufficiently 
evinces in the opinion of your committee, that the labor of 
slaves is not necessary to promote the growth and settlement 
of colonies in that region. That this labor, demonstrable the 
dearest of any, can only be employed to advantage in the 
cultivation of products more valuable than any known to that 
quarter of the United States: that the committee deem it 
highly dangerous and inexpedient to impair a provision wisely 
calculated to promote the happiness and prosperity of the 
Northwestern country, and to give strength and security to 
that extensive frontier. In the salutary operation of this 
sagacious and benevolent restraint, it is believed that the 
inhabitants of Indiana will, at no very distant day, find ample 
remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of emi- 
gration. 

On the various objects of the memorial, your committee 
beg leave to observe: 

That, an appropriation having been made, empowering the 
Executive to extinguish Indian titles to lands within the limits 
of the United States, the particular direction of that power 
rests entirely with that department of the Government ; that, 
to peiTnit the location of the claims under the resolve of Con- 
gress of the 29th of August, 1788, and the act of the 3d of 
March, 1791, (of whose number and extent the committee 
are entirely ignorant) in the mode pointed out in the me- 
morial, would be an infringement upon that regular mode of 
survey and of location which has been so happily adhered to 
in relation to the public lands. At the same time, the com- 
mittee are of opinion that, after those lands shall have been 
surveyed, a certain number of townships should be desig- 
nated, out of which the claims aforesaid ought to be satis- 
fied. In a country abounding in new and unsettled lands, it 
is presumed that every individual may become a proprietor 
of the soil; and inasmuch as the people of Indiana will at 
a period not far distant, be enabled to establish the right of 
suffrage on such principles as the majority may approve, the 
committee deem it inexpedient to alter a regulation whose 



 

effect is to retain in the hands of persons necessarily attached 
to the welfare of the country, the Government of a remote 
dependency, which, from its vicinage to the territories of 
foreign States, and from the sparseness of its population, 
might, otherwise, be exposed to foreigni intrigue and influence. 
Measures having been taken to put the salt spring below 
the mouth of the Wabash river in a situation to yield every 
possible benefit to the adjacent country, the committee are 
of opinion that it is, at this time, enexpedient to vest that 
property in the Legislature of the Indiana territory. From 
such a consideration as they have been enabled to bestow on 
the subject at this late period of the session, and under the 
pressure of accumulating business they recommend the fol- 
lowing resolutions, which are respectfully submitted to the 
judgment of the House : 

1. Resolved, That it is inexpedient to suspend, for a lim- 
ited time, the operation of the sixth article of compact be- 
tween the original States and the people and States west of 
the river Ohio. 

2. Resolved, That a provision, not exceeding one thirty- 
sixth part of the public lands within the Indiana territory, 
ought to be made for the support of schools within the same. 

3. Resolved, That the Secretaiy of the Treasury be, and 
he hereby is, required to cause an estimate to be made of 
the number and extent of their claims to lands under the 
resolve of Congress of the 29th of August, 1788, and the 
act of the 3d of March, 1791 ; and to lay the same before this 
House at the ensuing session of Congress. - 

4. Resolved, That in all sales of the public lands within 
the territory of Indiana, the right of pre-emption be given 
to actual settlers on the same. 

.5. Resolved, That it is inexpedient to grant lands to indi- 
viduals for the puri30se of establishing houses of entertain- 
ment, and of opening certain roads.- 

6. Resolved, That it is, at this time, inexpedient to vest 
in the Legislature of the Indiana the salt spring below the 
mouth of the Wabash river. 

7. Resolved, That it is inexpedient to alter the existing 
regulation of the right of suffrage within the said territory. 

2. The third resolution refers to Fi-ench land claims around Vincennes. 

3. Harrison had asked for a donation of land for a tavern every ten miles along the 
post road from Louisville to St. Louis via Vincennes. 



 

8. Resolved, That compensation ought to be made to the 
attorney General of the said territory, for service performed 
by him in behalf of the United States.

Sir: 

Such has been the irregularity of the mails from the sever- 
ity of the winter that your favor of the 17th of January did 
not reach me until a few days ago. The same cause must 
have retarded my letter of the 14th of Dec. which I suppose 
had not been received when yours of the above date was 
written. 

Capt. [William] Wells has certainly not exerted himself to 
pacify the Indians who have taken offence at the late Treaties 
[Vincennes, Sept. 17, 1802] with the Delawares and Pianke- 
shaws. It is equally certain that the disaffected are not as 
numerous as he has stated them to be and that those who 
have expressed discontent have been instigated thereto en- 
tirely by the Turtle.' Whether the idea of opposition to those 
Treaties originated with himself or with Mr. Wells I cannot 
deteiTnine but that the opinions of the one are always the 
opinions of the other. I have long known The Turtle has 
considerable influence over the Five Medals" and some others 
of the Potawatomi chiefs and I believe that Captain Wells 
and himself control entirely the small band of Eel River In- 
dians. But when Wells spealis of the Miami Nation being 
of this or that opinion he must be understood as meaning 
no more than the Turtle and himself. Nine tenths of that 
Tribe who acknowledge Richardville and Peccan'' for their 

1. Little Turtle, or Mi-shi-kin-na-kwa. was the greatest of the Miamis. Born near 
the site of Foi-t Wayne about 1761, he died and was buried there July 14, 1812. He 
led his tribe at Hai-mar's defeat, 1790. St. Clair's defeat. 1791, and at his own defeat 
by Wayne at Fallen Timbers, 1794. 

2. Five Medals. Onoxa or WononBoseah, war chief of the Pottawatamie tribe on 
the river St. Joseph of Lake Michigan ; his village was upon the Elkhart tributary of

HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 77 

chiefs (but who are really governed by an artful fellow called 
the Owl and Long Beard whom you once saw at the seat of 
government) utterly abhor both Wells and the Turtle. On 
this occasion however they may have been induced to join 
in the clamor from the expectation of deriving some advan- 
tage from it. 

After a careful and a dispassionate consideration of the 
subject I can see no reason to alter the opinion I had formed 
that neither the Miamis nor the Potawatomis have any just 
claim either in common or otherwise to any part of the Tracts 
ceded to the United States by the Delawares and Piankeshaws. 
The Delaware claim to that particular tract was derived from 
Present occupancy and from a grant said to have been made 
to them upwards of thirty years ago by the Piankeshaws. 
When the French first descended the Wabash the Pianke- 
shaws were found in the possession of the country on either 
side of that River from its mouth at least as high up as the 
Vermilion and the possession of it has never been disputed 
excepting by the Delawares who claimed under the Pianke- 
shaws and the Weas who have occupied the country above 
Point Coupee since their Towns at Ouiatenon were destroyed 
by Generals Scott and Wilkinson in the year 1791. 

That the Piankeshaws are a Tribe of the large confederacy 
which obtained the appelation of Miamis from the superior 
size of the particular Tribe to which that name more prop- 
erly belonged is not denied. The tie however which united 
them with their brethren has become so feeble that for many 
years past the connection has been scarcely acknowledged. 
For a considerable time antecedent to the Treaty of Greene- 
ville the Piankeshaws found it necessary to adopt a different 
policy from that which was pursued by the Tribes their Allies. 
Three considerable bodies of men led into the heart of their 
country by General Clark between the years 1779 and 1786 
convinced them that their union with the Miamis could not 
afford them the safety and protection which was no doubt 
the object of it and several conferences were held between Gen- 
eral Clark and his officers and their chiefs which resulted in 
the establishment of peace between them and the United 
States. The proceedings at one of these Conferences is pre- 
sented in Imlays History of Kentucky Vol. 2nd page 79 and 
no mention is made of the Miami Nation. 



 

The assertion of Wells in his letter to you of the 7th Dec. 
that for upwards of 20 years which he had known the In- 
dians in this Quarter nothing of importance had ever been 
transacted by the Piankeshaws and Kaskaskias without the 
consent of the Miamis is a notorious falsehood. A treaty 
was made at this place in the year 1792 by Genl. Putnam^ 
with the Piankeshaws and Weas and peace established between 
those Tribes and the United States — the Miamis were not 
parties to his treaty and continued their hostilities against 
us until they were compelled to sue for peace in the year 1795. 
Mr. Wells was present at Putnam's Treaty and I believe was 
employed as an interpreter. 

Although the language customs and manners of the Kas- 
kaskias make it sufficiently certain that they derive their 
origin from the same source as the Miamis the connection 
had been dissolved even before the French had penetrated 
from Canada to the Mississippi. At that time a confederacy 
of five tribes existed in the Illinois Country composed of the 
Tribes called the Peorias, Kaskaskias, Mitchegams, Cahokias, 
and Tamaroes.'' There are persons now alive who remember 
when these confederates could bring into the field upwards 
of 2000 warriors. A long and unsuccessful war with the 
Sacs (in which they received no assistance from the Miamis) 
has reduced them to the contemptable band which follows 
Ducoign and a remnant of Peorias who procure a miserable 
subsistance by begging and stealing from the inhabitants of 
St. Genevieve, and since these wi-etched beings have been 
proscribed by these very Potawatomies who according to Mr. 
Wells have been and still are so closely united with the 
Miamis with which they are said to form one nation. The 
fear of extirpation by the Potawatomies was one of the 
principal inducements with the Kaskaskias to commit them- 
selves entirely to the protection of the United States.

The Kaskaskia Tribe never lifted the Tomahawli against 
the United States. The Miamis during the whole war with 
the Northwestern Indians were amongst the most active of 
their enemies and the most difficult to bring to a final ac- 
commodation. 

The Piankeshaws altho they gave assistance to the other 
Tribes in the commencement of the war seceded from the 
Confederacy and made peace with us three years before the 
Miamis. 

If then the Piankeshaws and Kaskaskias were competent to 
the important concerns of making peace and war without 
the consent of the Miamis, they must be equally so to sell 
land. Which is acknowledged by them and which is no longer 
useful to them. The Treaty of Greeneville contains nothing 
to authorize the belief that those two Tribes were considered 
at that time dependent upon the Miamis. None of their 
chiefs were present. They did not think it necessary to go 
as one of them had never been at war with the United States 
and the other had made peace three years before. But it 
was considered just that they would participate in the bounty 
of the United States for that purpose their names were in- 
troduced into the Treaty and the Weas (not the Miamis) 
their nearest neighbours were requested to sign for them. 

Inclosed is an address of the Turtle's to Wells which he 
desired might be sent to me for the purpose of convincing 
me that the Piankeshaws had no right to sell their lands. I 
can see nothing in it however to weaken what I have ad- 
vanced above. It is my decided opinion that the U. S. have 
the right to treat with either of the Tribes who were parties 
to the Treaty of Greeneville. Motives of humanity will 
always prevent them from purchasing lands which cannot be 
conveniently spared and the interest of those who without 
having any just claim to the land but who may desire their 
support from it will be attended to. These principles are 
exemplified by the Treaties made with two Tribes for one 
tract of land when a complete and legal title might perhaps 
have been obtained by the extinction of the claims of one. 

The Tract purchased of the Delawares and Piankeshaws 
[1802] is not nor never has been since my arrival in this 
country frequented as a hunting ground by either the Miamis 
or Potawatomies. None of the Indians go there to hunt buf- 
faloes (as Mr. Wells has asserted) not an animal of that 



 

kind having been seen within that tract for several years, 
nor is its generally flat surface well calculated for the resi- 
dence of bears. 

The Potawatomics so far from having any claim to land 
on the South East side of the Wabash acknowledge that 
they have trespassed upon the Miamis by settling on the north 
bank of that river and it has been an object with the Turtle 
and Wells for several years to get them to remain. 

You will perceive by my letter to Mr. Wells a copy of 
which was inclosed in mine to you of the 14th Dec. that I 
had directed him to send the Potawatomie and Miami Chiefs 
to me at this place. The Little Turtle has declined the invita- 
tion and gives the artful and mischievous reason which you 
will see in the enclosed address and I am persuaded that he 
will make every exertion in his power to prevent my seeing 
the Potawatomies at any other place than Fort Wayne. I 
do not know whether Wells has informed the Potawatomie 
Chiefs of my wishes to have an interview with them. In his 
answer to my letter he contents himself with announcing the 
refusal of the Turtle. 

As there can be no doubt but that everything that can be 
advanced in favor of the Miami claim is to be found in the 
Turtle's Address to the President, in that to Mr. Wells and 
in Well's own letters the matter will be fully before the 
President and I must beg for further instructions unless it 
is determined to admit the principle that the Delawares and 
Piankeshaws had no right to sell their land without the con- 
sent of the Miamis Potawatomies &c. It will be improper 
in my opinion to have a public conference on the subject as 
it will be necessary to invite not only the chiefs of those two 
Tribes but those of the Weas Eel River Kickapoos and Shaw- 
nese Tribes and I know that they can never be convinced with- 
out a gratification which will considerably exceed the original 
purchase money. 

From the enclosed address of Wells which is said to have 
been made to the Miami chief but I am convinced was made 
to the Turtle alone I am afraid that he has misunderstood 
your instructions. He assures the Indians that if they can 
show a just claim to the land in question restitution will in- 
stantly be made. He uses the same expression in the letter 
which enclosed the address. 

The violent opposition which the Turtle has made to the 



 

Delaware and Piankeshaw Treaties is easily accounted for. 
Conscious of the superiority of his Talents over the rest of 
his race and colour he sighs for a more conspicuous theatre 
to display them. Opportunities for exhibiting his eloquence 
occur too seldom to satisfy his vanity and the subjects which 
are generally discussed in the councils of the few chiefs who 
adhere to him, are too contemptible to gratify his ambition. 
A chosen connexion among the neighbouring Tribes and a 
regular convention of their chiefs has long been the ruling 
wish of his heart and the object of numberless intrigues. 
An attachment for his person, a submissive defference to his 
talents, or a supposed coincidence of interests has caused the 
Agent of the United States to adopt the opinions and pro- 
mote the views of the Turtle to the utmost extent of his 
public as well as piivate influence. The propriety of deliver- 
ing at Fort Wayne the annuities for the Tribes on the lower 
part of the Wabash and of obliging them (the Weas par- 
ticularly) to remove to the neighborhood of that place and 
the benefits that would result to the United States as well 
as to the Indians by an annual assemblage of the chiefs of 
all the Tribes at which all business was to be transacted has 
been often pressed upon me. The Treaties with the Kas- 
kaskias or the Delaware and Piankeshaw Tribes has given a 
mortal stab to the favourite scheme and altho I am convinced 
that very few of the Indians feel any injury from those 
Treaties it is very easy to persuade them that they have been 
injured. 

Capt. Wells's conduct in this affair certainly deserves severe 
animadversion. I think it probable however that he did not 
foresee the consequences of it to the public interests and that 
some ridiculous spice of jealousy towards myself may have 
mingled itself with his motives. In order to prevent the like 
in future and to secure a just and proper dependance upon 
the Head of the Department I must take the liberty to recom- 
mend that he may be informed by you that the approbation 
of the President of the Continuance of his favour will depend 
upon the reports which I may make of the ^eal and fidelity 
with which he seconds me in executing the orders of the gov- 
ernment. There is perhaps no department which requires 
greater unanimity amongst the agents than that which has 
the management of Indian afl'airs. The jealousy of those 



 

people is so easily excited that a single artful observation is 
frequently sufficient to defeat the best concerted plans even 
when on the point of conclusion. 

I was not present when the Miamis recognized the Title of 
the Delawares to the country between the White River and 
the Ohio but I have no doubt of the fact ; it came to my knowl- 
edge in the following manner. I did myself the honor to 
inform you after my return from Fort Wajme in the year 
1803 that the Owl or Long Beard had with very considerable 
address prevented the great body of the Miamis from attend- 
ing my summons to meet me at Fort Wayne for the purpose 
of receiving their annuities and concluding the Treaty the 
preliminaries of which had been fixed at this place the pre- 
ceding fall and that after waiting for them a considerable 
time I was forced to content myself with the signatures of 
Richardville, the Sachem of the Nation, and the Turtle. Two 
days after the Treaty had been signed and at the very moment 
of my departure, the Owl arrived with a principal chief called 
Peccom [Pecan] a number of minor Chiefs and 100 or 150 
Warriors. It was a matter of importance to expose to the 
Miamis the arts of the Owl and to explain to them the con- 
ditions of the Treaty. A council was then appointed for the 
next day and all the chiefs of the other tribes who were still 
within reach (for some of them had returned) were requested 
to attend — the time for the meeting of the council arrived 
but neither the Miamis nor the Delawares appeared. After 
waiting for them a considerable time I was informed that 
those two Tribes were in council together and soon time 
after the Delawares arrived — there were then with me Gen- 
eral Gibson^ Wm. Wells, The Turtle and a few of his fol- 
lowers and some Potawatomie Chiefs. Tetohoscke the Dela- 
ware Sachem produced a belt of Wampum and addressing 
himself to me through Genl. Gibson observed that the Miami 
Chiefs had that morning with the consent of all their war- 
riors acknowledged their right to the lands between the White 
River and the Ohio and had given them that wampum to com- 
memorate the transaction. The Miamis joined in immediately 
after and as soon as I had reproached them with their im-

proper and disrespectful conduct and explained the artifices 
by which the Owl had mislead and embarrassed their affairs 
I was obliged to have the conclusion of the council to Wm. 
Wells set out on my return as I had upwards of thirty miles 
to ride on that day to the place where my boat had been left 
on the Wabash and the Water was falling so rapidly as to 
make the utmost expedition necessary to secure my passage. 
The Miamis were induced to take this step by the persuasions 
of the Owl and his object was to strengthen his party by 
gaining over the Delawares an object which engaged the 
Turtle's attention at that time also. The charges which the 
Turtle has brought against me in his address to the Presi- 
dent, I should have passed over without an observation if he 
had not hinted at the use of unfair means in procuring the 
consent of the Indians to the Treaties, I have made with 
them and as I have never before that I recollect informed 
you of my mode of proceeding on these occasions I have 
thought it proper to do so at the present moment. When- 
ever the Indians have assembled for any public purpose the 
use of ardent spirits has been strictly interdicted until the 
object for which they were convened was accomplished and 
if in spite of my vigilance it had been procured a stop was 
immediately put to all business until it was consumed and its 
effects completely over. Every conference with the Indians 
has been in public. All persons who chose to attend were 
admitted and the most intelligent and respectable characters 
in the neighborhood specially invited to witness the fairness 
of the transaction. No treaty has ever been signed until 
each article was particularly and repeatedly explained by the 
most capable and confidential interpreters. Sketches of the 
tract of country about to be ceded have always been sub- 
mitted to the Indians and their own rough delineations made 
on the floor with a bit of charcoal have proved their perfect 
comprehension of its situation and extent. 

As I am convinced that it will be almost impossible to get 
the Miami and Potawatomi chiefs here under present cir- 
cumstances I have held myself in readiness to proceed to 
Fort Wayne immediately upon the receipt of your answer 
when I hope to be indulged with your particular instructions. 
By an indirect channel I am informed that it is in contem- 
plation to continue the United States road which is completed 
as far as Dayton on the Miami to this place. I fear that it 



 

will be very difficult to prevail on the Indians to consent to it. 

Richardville the Sachem or Principal Chief of the Miamis 
whose father was a Frenchman carries on a small trade with 
that Tribe. He generally procures his goods on the British 
side of the lakes and the duties have always been exacted 
from him by the collector of Duties Contrary in my opinion 
to the Treaty with Great Britain. He had applied to me for 
redress — if you would think as I do I must beg your inter- 
ference to relieve him from the Duties in future. There is 
no doubt of his attachment to our interests. 

I have lately received intelligence from the Arkansas in- 
forming me that the Osages ha\e plundered the Traders and 
other inhabitants upon that River to an immense amount. 

I have the Honor to be with perfect esteem and respect

Proclamation Erecting Dearborn County and Appointing 
Officers for Same 

March 7, 1803 
Cincinnati Westeiti Spy, April 6, 1803 

Whereas, I have received a petition from a number of citi- 
zens, inhabiting the south-east corner of the territory, stating 
the inconveniences they labor under for the want of a county 
establishment in that quarter, and praying that a new county 
may be laid off. 

And whereas, I have received satisfactory evidence that 
there are a sufficient number of inhabitants vdthin the pro- 
posed limits to justify a compliance with their request. I 
have thought proper to erect into a separate county all the 
lands lying and being within the following lands and lines 
and bounds, viz. Beginning at the mouth of the Great Miami 
thence north along the line separating the Indiana territory 
from the state of Ohio, to the intersection thereof with the 
Indiana boundary line running from a point opposite the 
mouth of the Kentucky River, thence, along the last men- 
tioned line to the Ohio river and up the said river to the 
place of beginning; and the said county shall be known as 
designated by the name and styled under county of Dear- 



 

born and all the lands lying within the above described lines, 
and boundaries are hereby erected into the county of Dear- 
born ; and the inhabitants of the said county of Dearborn 
shall have and enjoy all the rights privileges, and immunities 
whatsoever which to a county and the inhabitants thereof 
in any wise appertain. 

And ^vhereas it is of the utmost importance that a proper 
place should be selected in the name of justice for the said 
county, and as the information I have received, does not 
enable me at present to determine on the subject, I have 
thought proper to declare and ordain that until a permanent 
seat of justice shall be fixed in the session of the court of 
common pleas of the general quarter sessions of the peace 
and of the orphans court of the said county, shall be held at 
the to\vn of Lawi'enceburgh. 

And I do hereby appoint Benjamin Chambers,^ Esquire, 
and his associates the justices of the courts of the quarter 
sessions of the peace for said county or any three of them 
commissioners to enquire into and report to me on a proper 
place for the permanent seat of justice as aforesaid. 

In testimony whereof I, William Henry Harrison, Gov- 
ernor, hath hereunder set my hand and caused the seal of the 
territory to be hereunder affixed, at Vincennes, this 7th day 
of March, Anno Domino, one thousand eight hundred and 
three and of the independence of the United States of Amer- 
ica the twenty seventh.

Petition for Power to Lay a Tax 

Vincennes, November 19, 1803 

House of Representatives Collection No. 8. 1802-09 

To the Honorable The Senate and House of Representa- 
tives of the United States in Congress Assembled, 
The Memorial and petition of William Henry 
Harrison Goveraor of the Indiana Territoiy 
Respectfully sheweth. 

That your Memorialist, being authorized thereto by a Reso- 
lution of the Governor and Judges' of the Indiana Territory, 
in their legislative Capacity, a Copy of which is hereunto 
annexed, has the honor to represent to Congress; 

That much Inconvenience has arisen, and does daily arise 
to the Citizens, from the Want of Money in the territorial 
Treasury to answer the Exigencies of the Government, which 
is unable to command a sufficient sum, even for the Appre- 
hension and prosecution of the most notorious offenders 
against the laws. 

Every object which would bear a Tax, and for [which] 
legal precedent could be found, has been sufficiently bui-thened 
to raise County Levies for the Erection of Jails, Court Houses 
&c. And after the most mature Consideration, it was evi- 
dent to the Governor and Judges, that no Way of raising the 
sum, which the Circumstances of the Territory required, was 
so eligible as by imposing a small Tax upon the Indian 
Traders. No Tax could be collected with so much facility, 
or paid with so much Ease ; and none can be more equitable, 
as all the other Traders in the Country contribute fifteen 
Dollars yearly towards the Support of County Establishments. 

1. This petition was read in the House of Representatives Jan. 2, 1804. referred 
to a committee — John W. Eppes of Va.. Henry W. Livingston of N. Y. and Ebenezer 
Elmer of N. J. On the 10th of Januai-y this committee made an adverse Report.

Your Memorialist therefore prays, that a law may be 
passed, authorizing and requiring the Superintendant of In- 
dian Affairs or x)ther persons empowered to issue Licences 
to Indian Traders, within the Indiana Territory, to receive 
•for each Licence issued, such a Sum for the Use of the said 
Territory, as in your wisdom may be thought reasonable. 
And your Petitioner as in Duty bound shall ever pray &c —

Resolved that the Governor be and is hereby requested to 
make application to Congress for leave to impose a reasonable 
tax, yearly, on all persons trading with the Indian tribes 
within this Territory to and for the use thereof. 
The foregoing is hereby declared to be a law of the Territory 
and to take effect accordingly. In Testimony whereof we, 
William Henry Harrison, Thomas T. Davis and Henry Van-

Madison to Congress 

December 1, 1803 
Har. Pa. il5, il6 

The Secretary of State to whom by a resolution of the 
House of Representatives of the 2d March last was referred 
a Petition of sundry inhabitants of Post St. Vincennes in the 
Indiana Territory; has examined the same, and thereupon 
makes the following reports, viz. The petitioners assert a 
right to a tract of land which they describe as extending 
along the Wabash River from Point Coupee to the Mouth of 
the White River comprising about seventy-two miles above 
and below Post St. Vincennes, and on both banks of the said 
River from the little Wabash to the Protoeas [Panse au 
Pichou?] River, forming according to their computation an 
extent in this direction of two hundred and twenty-six miles. 
This right they pretend to derive from an Indian grant to 
their predecessors as the first settlers of that District, as 
well as from a subsequent confiiTnation of it by the Indians. 
It is on the basis of these pretentions that they express their 
hopes that Congress will "allow them at least a part in the 
grants which have lately been made by the Indians to the 
United States" and they add the request that a small tract 
of Woodland on the banks of the Wabash may be annexed 

1. This seems to refer to Lewis Evans, a colonial seographer who died in 1756. 
His maps were published in 1776 and used by the British ai-mies. 



 

to the villages Commons, which is now become destitute of 
Wood.i 

It would be unnecessary to contest the validity of this In- 
dian grant and confirmation, since the inhabitants have re- 
peatedly and formally renounced all the right they possessed 
to the tract in question, particularly in their address to Con- 
gress of the 26 July 1787 in which they use the following 
words: "Reposing the most unbounded confidence in the 
justice, humanity and benevolence of the honorable Congress 
we solemnly surrender our charter whatever it is, and throw 
ourselves upon your mercy". An extract from this source 
documents and others from Mr. Tardiveau's- address to Con- 
gress in their behalf dated 7th August 1787, and 28th Feb. 
1788, and also the powers given to him by the inhabitants 
of St. Vincennes as their agent are annexed. This renunci- 
ation as far as it might be supposed by the inhabitants to 
relate to a valid title in themselves was doubtless one of the 
motives to the grant and confirmations made to them by Con- 
gress in their acts of 20th June and 29th August 1788, and 
3d March 1791, the latter of which ought to be considered as 
closing the claims of the settlers of St. Vincennes. 

For these reasons the Secretary of State is of opinion that 
the petition ought not to be granted, which is respectfully 
submitted.

the Indiana Territory, also a memorial and petition from the 
said convention, together with the report of a former com- 
mittee on the "same subject at the last session of Congress 
made the following report: 

That taking into their consideration the facts stated in the 
said memorial and petition, they are induced to believe that 
a qualified suspension, for a limited time, of the sixth article 
of compact between the original States and the people and 
States west of the river Ohio, might be productive of benefit 
and advantage to the said Territory. 

They do not conceive it would be proper to break in upon 
the system adopted for surveying and locating public lands, 
which experience has proved so well calculated to promote 
the general interest. If a preference be given to particular 
individuals in the present instance, an example will be set, 
by which future claimants will obtain the same privilege. 
The committee are, nevertheless, of opinion, that after those 
lands shall have been surveyed, a certain number of town- 
ships should be designated, out of which the claims stated in 
the memorial ought to be satisfied, and that, for the encour- 
agement of actual settlers, the right of pre-emption should 
be secured to them. 

They consider the existing regulations contained in the or- 
dinance for the government of the Territory of the United 
States, which requires a freehold of fifty acres as a qualifica- 
tion for an elector of the General Assembly, as limiting too 
much the elective franchise. They conceive the vital prin- 
ciple of a free Government is, that taxation and representa- 
tion should go together after a residence of sufiicient length 
to manifest the intention of becoming a permanent inhabitant, 
and to evince, by conduct orderly and upright, that a person 
is entitled to the rights of an elector. This probationary 
period should not extend beyond two years. 

It must be the true policy of the United States, with the 
millions of acres of habitable country which she possesses, 
to cherish those principles which gave birth to her inde- 
pendence, and created her a nation, by affording an asylum 
to the oppressed of all countries. 

One important object desired in the memorial, the extin- 
guishment of the Indian title to certain lands, has been hap- 
pily accomplished ; whilst the salt spring below the mouth of 



 

the Wabash river has also been placed in a situation to be 
productive of every reasonable advantage. 

After a careful review and an attentive consideration of 
the various subjects contemplated in the memorial and peti- 
tion, the conmiittee respectfully submit to the House the fol- 
lowing resolutions, as embracing all the objects which re- 
quire the attention of Congress at this period : 

Resolved, That the sixth article of the ordinance of 1787, 
which prohibited slavery within the said Territory, be sus- 
pended, in a qualified manner, for ten years, so as to permit 
the introduction of slaves, born within the United States, 
from any of the individual States: Provided, That such in- 
dividual State does not permit the importation of slaves from 
foreign countries: And provided further, That the descend- 
ants of all such slaves shall, if males, be free at the age of 
twenty-five years, and, if females, at the age of twenty-one 
years. 

2. Resolved, That every white free man, of the age of 
twenty-one years, who has resided within the Territory, two 
years, and \vithin that time paid a territorial tax which shall 
have been assessed six months before the election, shall enjoy 
the right of an elector of members of the General Assembly. 

3. Resolved, That in all cases of sales of land within the 
Indiana Territory, the right of pre-emption be given to actual 
settlers on the same. 

4. Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be, and 
he is hereby, required to cause an estimate to be made of the 
number and extent of the claims to lands under the resolu- 
tion of Congress of the 29th of August, 1788, and the law of 
the 3d of March, 1796, and to lay the same before this House. 

5. Resolved, That provision, not exceeding one thirty- 
sixth part of the public lands within the Indiana Territory, 
ought to be made for the support of schools within the same. 

6. Resolved, That it is inexpedient to grant lands to in- 
dividuals for the purpose of establishing houses of entertain- 
ment, and opening certain roads. 

7. Resolved, That it is inexpedient, at this time, to vest 
in the Legislature of Louisiana [misprint for Indiana] Ter- 
ritory the salt spring below the mouth of the Wabash river. 

8. Resolved, That compensation ought to be made to the 
attorney general of the said Territory for services performed 
by him on behalf of the United States.

Washington Mar. 31, 04

The act of Congress erecting Louisiana into two territories, 
and providing for their government annexes the upper one 
by the name of the district of Louisiana to the Indiana gov- 
ernment. As you will see the act shortly in print, I shall 
only observe generally that it does not come into force till 
the 1st of October, but it provides that the upper territory 
shall be divided into districts by the Governor of Indiana 
under the direction of the President, as the convenience of 
the settlements shall require ; the inhabitants of each, between 
18 and 45 to be formed into a militia, with proper officers &c. 
This division being the basis of the government, it must be 
prepared, and ready to be declared on the 1st day of Octo- 
ber and, as we are far apart, we must immediately commence 
the enquiries necessary, and the mutual intercommunication 
of sentiment on the subject. I must therefore pray you with- 
out delay to inform yourself of the different settlements ex- 
isting in the country, their numbers black & white, their 
distance from each other the ease or difficulty of intercourse 
between them, and to communicate this to me with your first 
ideas as to the number and divisions of the districts we should 
lay off. As something to begin upon I will barely mention 
that on the imperfect information I have, I suppose we may 
throw the settlements together so as to make three or four 
districts, something like our frontier counties in Virginia. 
But to decide on this further information is necessary, and 
this I shall hope to i-ecieve from you. Accept my salutations 
and assurances of respect.

Har. Pa. ilT-S 

GovR. Harrison, Vincennes, 
Sir: 

I have received your letter of the 17th inst. [?] It was 
my intention to confide the appointment of a Gazette to print 
the Laws of the United States entirely to you, and the rea- 
sons you assign for the choice of Mr. Bradford's are satis- 
factory.' I have no controul over the sum appropriated for 
the contingent expenses of your Territory ; and therefore can- 
not prevent the payment of the accounts for stationary out 
of it, but if neither yourself nor the Secretary of the ter- 
ritory direct supplies of stationary to be furnished your ob- 
ject will be attained provided no outstanding accounts exist 
to absorb the appropriations. 

* "In the spring of 1804, Simon Vannorsdell, acting as agent for the heirs of 
John and Elizabeth Kuykendall. arrested two negroes named George and Peggy, at 
Vincennes, and was about to carry them out of the Territory. Harrison issued a 
proclamation forbidding this, based on infoi-mation that Vannorsdell was "about to 
transport from the Territory certain indented sei-vants, without their consent first had 
and obtained, with a design as is supposed of selling them for slaves." {Executive 
Journal, April 6, ISOi). Vannorsdell was indicted, and habeas corpus proceedings were 
instituted to free the negroes. At the September term of court, Vannorsdell was dis- 
charged, no one appearing to prosecute him : but the court released the negioes from 
his custody. Vannorsdell. assisted by John Huling, at once rearrested the negroes, 
but a new habeas corpus proceeding was instituted for their lelease. This was con- 
tinued to the next term, Harrison, General W. Johnston, and John Johnston becoming 
bail for the negroes. (Ter. Court Docket. September Term, 1804). At the June term. 
1805, the negroes were produced, but pending the iiroceedings George had indented 
himself to Han-ison for a tei-m of eleven years, and the case as to him was dropped. 
Peggy was released by the court in April, 1801!. and afteiwaids sued Vannorsdell for 
wages during her detention, but the trial resulted in a finding for the defendant." 
Dunn, Indiana, SIS (Ter. Court Docket, September Term, 1808, p. 337). 

1. Bradford was the publisher of the Kciiturkii Cazcttc at Lexington. From this 
office came Elihu Stout who started the Indiana Gazette at Vincennes July 4. 1804. It 
is probable Stout was already in Vincennes. One would have expected Harrison to 
send the printing to Cincinnati. 



 

An appropriation was made to pay the expense of the civil 
government of Louisiana, but it is feared it will not be suf- 
ficient to cover the expenses incurred and to be incurred un- 
der the Administration of Governor Claiborne, no part of 
it can therefore be counted upon for printing the laws, which 
may be made for that part of the Territory which after the 
1st of Oct. next will be united with the Indiana Territory; 
but no doubt can be entertained that Congress will at their 
next session make provision for all the expenses which may 
be necessarily incurred. By recurring to the 13th Section of 
the law providing for the Government of the two territories 
in which Louisiana is to be divided, you will find that the 
Laws of Louisiana will remain in force after the first of 
October under certain modifications: and therefore the en- 
tirely new code you contemplate is unnecessaiy and ought 
not to be published : all that appears to be indispensable are 
laws for organizing the Courts, the Militia and laying out 
the Territory into districts. Exclusively of the annual ap- 
propriation of 350 Doll, for the contingent expenses of the 
territory, which will be suflicient to pay the current expenses 
of the year, there is an unexpended balance of 480 dollars 
which may be applied to the expense of printing territorial 
laws.

James Madison 

Harrison to Jefferson 

ViNCENNES 24th June 1804 

Jefferson Papers, 2d series, vol. J,2, no. 78, 79 
SIR 

The result of my enquiries relative to Upper Louisiana fixes 
the population of that District at 9373 souls of whom 7876 
are whites and 1497 blacks. 

I am still of opinion that it would answer all the purposes 
of Civil Government & be sufliciently Convenient to the In- 
habitants to lay out the Country into four or five divisions 
or Counties, whose boundaries might be very nearly the same 
as those which Seperated the principal Districts under the 
Spanish Govemment. From the best information which I 
have been able to procure the arrangement of the Districts 
should be as follows viz — 



 

1. The Settlement of Arkansas should form one District, 
as from its Detached Situation it could not conveniently be 
connected with any other — it contains 160 Whites & 12 blacks 
— there are no settlements below it that will fall within the 
Upper Government, & none above it nearer than 300 Miles. 

2 The lower Settlements of the Little Prairie might form 
the Southern boundary & a line drawii due West from the 
Southerly extremity of the Great bend of the Mississippi to 
the River St. Francis the Northern boundary of the 2nd Divi- 
sion or District. The Census of this district was taken in 
the beginning of the year 1803 & the population (with the 
addition of five per centum for increase from that time) is 
about 800 Whites and 100 blacks. 

3 The dividing line between the third & fourth Districts 
should be Apple creek from its junction with the Mississippi 
to its source & thence by a due West line to the River St. 
Francis. Adding five per centum to the Census of 1803 & 
the District as thus described Contains 1200 Whites & 200 
blacks. 

4. The dividing line between the 4 & 5th Districts ought 
to commence at the Mouth of Platers Creek on the Missis- 
sippi thence up sd. Creek to its source, thence due West to 
the fork of the Mesumack called Anneau thence down sd. 
fork to the Mesumack thence up the Mesumack to the upper 
settlements on the River. The Census of this District has not 
been taken since the year 1800 — the result of that Census & 
twenty per centum added for increase gives a population of 
1978 Whites & 500 blacks. 

5. All the Territory to the Northward of the line last 
described can conveniently be fonned into a 5th District, & 
Contains a population (founded on the same calculations as in 
the preceding) of 3738 Whites & 667 blacks. 

This arrangement of the Districts seems to be the one 
which is generally expected to be made by the Inhabitants 
of that country & I immagine it would give as much satis- 
faction as any other mode of laying it out unless the num- 
ber of the Districts was encreased. Some of them are how- 
ever very extensive & the Settlements so widely separated that 
it may perhaps be necessary that the County Courts should 
be holden at Different places — of this I am not at present 
able to decide upon as I could not procure satisfactory infor- 



 

mation Respecting the relative situations of the Several settle- 
ments which compose a district. 

I have no means of ascertaining correctly the number of 
Militia, but from the proportion which that description of 
persons generally have to the whole population. If they can 
be estimated at one fifth the number of men capable of bear- 
ing amis in the several Districts as I have described them 
will be nearly as follows Viz In the 1st District 40 whites 
& 3 blacks in the 2nd 200 Whites & 25 blacks in the 3rd 300 
Whites & 75 blacks in the 4th 494 whites & 130 blacks, in 
the 5th 934 whites & 166 blacks total 1968 Whites & 399 
blacks. I understand from Captn [Amos] Stoddard that he 
has formed the whole Militia of the Country into 24 Com- 
panies of which there is in Arkansas one — within the bounds 
of the 2nd District four, in the 3rd three — in the 4th five & 
in the 5th eleven. In making this arrangement he says that 
he attended not so much to the number of men in each Com- 
pany as to the Contiguity of the Inhabitants & that in some 
Companies there are nearly 100 men in others not more than 
50. The jMilitia of Louisiana have never been formed into 
Battalions or Regiments — Companies were the largest divi- 
sions & a captaincy the Highest grade. This arrangement 
ought in my opinion no longer to exist. The prospect of pro- 
motion is one of the greatest inducements to men of enter- 
prise to accept of Military appointments & the most effectual 
stimulus to urge them to a prompt & faithful discharge of 
their duties I beg leave therefore to recommend that the 
Militia in the most populous Districts should be formed into 
Regiments composed of two or more Battalions with a Colonel 
for the Regiment & a Major for each Battalion. In such of 
the Districts as are unable to furnish two Battalions a Major 
might Command. 

I am sorry that it is not in my power to give you a more 
detailed account of the relative situations of the several Settle- 
ments in Louisiana — but the information which I have been 
enabled to procure on that subject is not as perfect as I 
could wish. & I did not think it proper to delay writing to 
you until it could be received from a More Authentic Source. 

The law providing for the Government of Louisiana directs 
that the Country should be laid off into "Districts". As the 
whole Country is called the District of Louisiana it appears to 



 

me that the Subdivisions might more properly be called Coun- 
ties. The District of St. Genevieve in the District of Louisi- 
ana would sound rather awkwardly. 

There is but one person in Louisiana that I will venture to 
recommend to you for the Appointment of Military Com- 
mandant — it is Mr. Piere Delossus de Luziere an old gentle- 
man of the greatest respectability and of considerable talents . 
— there can be but one objection to him which is that he was 
a friend to the former Despotic Government of France. I 
believe however that he is now in Sentiment an American 
Republican. His Manners His Talents & his destitute Con- 
dition have interested me much in his favour & I think I can 
venture to answer for his good Conduct. He is & has been 
for a considerable time Commandant of the District of New 
Bourbon. 

I propose to be in Louisiana by the 1st October & as I also 
intend to visit all the Districts it will be in my power to give 
you a more perfect account of the Country than I can pos- 
sibly do at this time. 

I have the Honour to be with the most perfect Respect your 
faithful Sevt.

No. 1 Plan 

At about three hundred miles from the village of the great 
Ozages in a west direction, after having passed many branches 
of the River Arkensas, is found a low ground, surrounded 
with Hills of an immense extent, having a diameter of about 
fifteen Leagues. The soil is a black sand, very fine, & so 
hard, that Horses hardly leave their tracks upon it; in warm 
and dry Weather, there is exhaled from that swamp, vapours, 
which being afterwards condensed, fall again upon the black 
sand and cover it with a bed of Salt very white and very fine 
of the thickness of about half an inch. The rains distroy this 
kind of Phenomenon. 



 

No. 2 Plan 

At a distance of about fifteen Leagues from the Swamp of 
which we have spoken, and in a South direction, there is a 
second mine of mineral Salt of the same nature as the other, 
these two differing only in their colour, the first inclining to 
the white, and the second approaching to the red, lastly much 
farther South and ahvays upon the branches of the Arkansas 
there is a salt Spring which may be considered as one of the 
most interesting Phenomenea of nature. 

On the declivity of a little hill, there are five holes of about 
a foot and a half diameter, by two of depth always full, with- 
out ever overflowing a drop very salt. If we take away this 
Salt water, it fills immediately; and at about ten feet lower, 
there comes out of this same Hill, a strong Spring of pure & 
Sweet water.. 

At a distance of about 18 Miles from this low land are 
found mines of mineral Salt, almost at the surface of the 
Earth. The Savages who know it perfectly, are found to 
employ leavers to break it and get it out of the Ground

Sir: 

Your Excellency's letter, of the 24th ultimo, has been duly 
received and considered. It is the opinion of the President 
of the United States, that every reasonable accommodation 
ought to be afforded the old Kaskaskias' chief [Ducoigne]. 
You will, therefoi-e, please to satisfy every reasonable request 
he may make on the score of living; he certainly is entitled 
to attention, and ought to be enabled to live decently, and in 
a due degree of independence. You v\ill please to draw on 
this Department, for such sums as may be necessary for fur- 
nishing him with suitable supplies for his family use, from 
time to time. Directions wiW be given, for having the bound- 
ary line ascertained, run, and marked as soon as possible. 
All adjustments with these nations, whose claims may inter- 
fere with the Kaskaskias' boundary, as per treaty, will rest 
with your Excellency. You will take such measures, and 
make such pecuniary advances to individual chiefs or others,

as their respective cases require. It may not be improper to 
procure from the Sacs, such cessions on both sides of the 
Ilhnois, as may entitle them to an annual compensation of 
five or six hundred dollars ; they ought to relinquish all pre- 
tensions to any land on the southern side of the Illinois, and 
a considerable tract on the other side ; and if any of the prin- 
cipal chiefs of the other nations shall discover an indication 
to follow the example of the old Kaskaskias' chiefs they ought 
to be encouraged more especially the Piankeshaws, whose lands 
divide the Vincennes territory, on the Wabash, from the ces- 
sions of the Kaskaskias. It would also be desirable to obtain 
the tract between the southern line of the Vincennes terri- 
tory and the Ohio. You will, of course, embrace every favor- 
able opportunity for obtaining cessions of such parts of the 
above mentioned tract as may occur by a fair and satis- 
factory bargain. It is suggested by the President of the 
United States, for your consideration and opinion, whether 
it would not be expedient to give certain annuities, to each 
actual family, during the existence of said family, even if 
the aggregate to a nation, should be increased 15 or 20 per 
cent. For instance, we give the Piankeshaws five hundred 
dollars per annum ; suppose they have fifty families, we agree 
to give the nation twelve dollars for each family annually 
and when a family becomes extinct, the annuity to cease, or 
if, when its members decrease, the annuity to decrease in 
proportion.

Sir: 

I had the honor to receive your letter of the 4th ultimo, 
and feel much obliged for the interesting information it con- 
tains. I have no doubt that Congress will agree that the 
parties whose lands have been surveyed under your direc- 
tion shall not be charged with additional expense for that 
object; and I have accordingly insti'ucted the surveyor-gen- 
eral. 



 

On the power of the commissioners to revise any decision 
of the Governor in case of complete grants, I have great 
doubts. At all events, it can only amount to a chancery juris- 
diction, which may set aside a patent surreptitiously and 
fraudulently obtained, through the false representations of 
the party, and never can affect a bona fide purchaser; nor 
be extended to defeat a title on account of what might, by 
the commissioners, be considered as an error of judgment in 
making the grant. On that principle, though I am not au- 
thorized to lay rules of conduct for the commissioners, in 
their judicial capacity, I have communicated my opinion in 
general terms, and have positively enjoined it on the registers 
to record in cases of Governor's grants, and demand a fee 
only for the recording of the grant itself, and not for any 
preceding or subsequent conveyances. The recording of the 
grants is essential and just, as it was undoubtedly the inten- 
tion of the legislature to ascertain the number, amount, and 
authenticity of those grants as well as of other claims; and 
they have a right to declare in what manner their own grants 
shall be recorded and authenticated. 

I have the honor to enclose copies of my letters to the regis- 
ters and to the surveyors general, and remain. Sir, 
Your obedient servant,

Dear Sir 

I received in due time your letter on the division of the 
Louisiana territory into districts, and since that I have been 
able to collect very satisfactory information on the subject 
as well from persons from that country as from good maps, 
on the whole I find we cannot do better than to adopt the 
existing divisions, which are five in number and will require 
5 Commandants of different grade. I would therefore rec- 
ommend that in the Proclamation which you will isue in due 
time for establishing the divisions, you use the following 
definitions. 



 

'All that portion of Louisiana lying North of the river 
Missouri, shall constitute one district by the name of the dis- 
trict of St. Charles. 

All that portion which heretofore constituted the district of 
St. Louis shall be one district by the name of the district of 
St. Louis. 

All that portion which heretofore constituted the district 
of Ste. Genevieve shall be one district by the name of the dis- 
trict of Ste. Genevieve. 

All that portion which heretofore constituted the district 
of Cape Girardeau shall be one district by the name of the 
district of Cape Girardeau. 

All that portion which heretofore constituted the district 
of New Madrid, and that lying Westward & Southward there- 
of to 33° of latitude shall be one district by the name of the 
district of New Madrid. 

And all the residue of the said country shall be divided by 
lines running due West from the Western termination of the 
present lines dividing the said districts, & each division there- 
of so formed shall be annexed to and make part of the dis- 
trict to which it is adjacent.' 

We learn that the Southern boundary of St. Louis is Platine

I am very sorry to have found lately that Mr. [John] Gib-

there never existed a doubt one moment about renewing it. 
it was kept back merely that it's three years might have the 
longer to run. on the last day of March (being to leave 
town the next day) I sent a memorandum to the office to 
have the commission filled up. it was by some means over- 



 

looked, and I never knew till a few days ago that it was so. 
I immediately signed one, giving the date formerly directed,

Sir 

Part of the inhabitants of this county labor under great 
inconvenience for want of a magestrate, viz. between the mouth 
of the Kentucky and Col. [Benjamin] Chamber's — [Law- 
renceburg] a distance, with the courses of the river, of near 
forty miles. The reason application has not e'er now been 
made, was the want of a suitable character to recommend — 
and we are sorry to add that this difficulty is not yet re- 
moved, but we are of opinion that to make a magestrate of 
the person hereinafter named will be a benefit to the county — 
he will, we hope, be better than none — and from the best in- 
formation we have been able to acquire, the appointment ol 
this man will be agreeable to the people of his neighborhood. 
We trust it will not be long before better materials may be 
furnished for the above purpose — in the meantime, we shall 
feel ourselves obliged, if you will be good enough to forward 
a commission of Justice of the peace & Judge of the Quarter 
Session, during pleasure if you are in the habit of making 
appointments in this way, for William Cotton.^ 

We are very respectfully. Sir,

Proclamation: For an Election on Entering Second 
Territorial Stage 

August 4, 1804 

Vincennes Indiana Gazette, August 21, 180^ 

Whereas, By a Law of the United States entitled "An act 
to divide the Territory of the United States North West of 
the Ohio, into two seperate Governments," it is enacted and 
declared "that so much of the ordinance for government of 
the Territory of the United States North West of the Ohio 
river as relates to the organization of a general assembly 
therein, and prescribes the powers thereof, shall be in force 
and operate in the Indiana Territory, whenever satisfactory 
evidence shall be given to the governor thereof that such is 
the wish of the majority of the freeholders, notwithstanding 
there may not be five thousand free male inhabitants of the 
age of twenty-one years and upward" ; 

And whereas, Petitions have been presented to me from a 
number of the good citizens of the Territory praying that a 
General Assembly may be organized, conformably to the 
above recited act, but as no evidence has been adduced to 
shew that the persons who have signed the said petitions 
are really a majority of the freeholders : 

Now therefore, for the purpose of ascertaining more cor- 
rectly the public sentiment on the subject, I have thought 
proper to issue this my proclamation hereby making known 
to all whom it may concern that an election will be held at 
the court house of each county respectively on Tuesday the 
eleventh day of September next, for the purpose of giving 
to all the citizens of the Territory who are qualified by law 
to vote on the question of going into the second or repre- 
sentative grade of government, an opportunity of declaring 
their wishes on the subject. And it is hereby made the duty 
of the several sheriffs to give due notice of the same, and on 
the said eleventh of September to open polls at the several 
court houses of their respective counties for the purpose 
aforesaid ; and the said election shall be conducted in the same 
manner and governed by the same principles as are laid dov.oi 
in a law regulating the elections of representatives for the 
General Assembly of the North Western Territory passed at 
Cincinnati, the 6th of December, 1799.' 

1. The passing to the second grade has been treated very e.xtensively by historians. 
as if it was an event of great moment and achieved by questionable methods. It seems 



 

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and

sand eight hundred and four, and of the Independence of the 
United States the twenty-ninth.

Mr. [Elihu] Stout:— The enclosed letter [July 10, 1804, 
above] from the Secretary of the Treasury, in answer to 
one addressed to him by me on the subject of the land claims 
in this and the two counties on the Mississippi, contains mat- 
ter so interesting to the citizens who are possessed of those 
claims that I have thought it proper to give it publicity, 
through the medium of your paper. 

By that letter, and those to the surveyor general and regis- 
ters to which it refers, it appears that three important points 
are established: 

1st. That the land granted by the Governors, and which 
has been laid off under their direction, is not to be resur- 
veyed at the expense of the proprietors. 

2nd. That no other title paper is to be recorded when the 
claim has been confirmed but the patent or other evidence of 
the confirmation. And — 

3rd. That all the grants made by the Governors are to 
be recognized, excepting such only as may have been "sur- 
reptitiously and fraudulently obtained, through the false rep- 
resentations of the party."

Dear Findlay, 

I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters one 
by post and one by Mr. Thomas. I began to think that you 
had forgotten me as some of my other friends in Cincinnati 
have done. I have long wished to pay you a visit but I have 
been hitherto prevented sometimes by Public and oftentimes 
by private business. I hope however that this will not always 
be the case. During the whole of this summer and part of 
last I have been engaged in building a large House [Har- 
rison House, Vincennes] which will I fear prove rather too 
expensive for my finances. However the trouble and three 
fourths of the expense will be at end in a few days and by 
next Spring I shall be in a situation to accomodate you and 
your large family,' if you should think it worth your while 
to come and see us. Independent of the gratification of see- 
ing your old friend you will be interested in the Country 
around this place — the appearance of which is altogether dif- 
ferent from anything you ever saw. 

I did not accept Mr. [Peyton] Shorts offer because I was 
informed that $1600 was not enough for my preemption 
Right; and had I been inclined to have taken $1600 the land 
which he offered me was certainly not worth $400. I have 
written to my brother to assist me in paying the first instal- 
ment in January next, and as I know he has the command of 
money I calculate with certainty upon receiving assistance 
from him unless he has entered into some engagement that 
I am unaquainted with. • I am very much indebted both to 
[David?] Killgour and yourself for the Indulgence shown 
with regard to the fees. 

Mrs. Harrison requests you to present her in the most af- 
fectionate terms to Mrs. Findlay. She (Mrs. H. — ) is very 
inuch distressed at my being obliged to leave her. I shall set 
out for Louisiana [St. Louis] about the 2d or 3d of October.^ 

1. Findlay had no children. 

2. The law of March 26, 1804. placed Upper Louisiana under Harrison's admin- 
inistration after Oct. 1. Harrison and the territorial judges reached St. Louis that 
day and took over the government from Capt. Amos Stoddard. 



 

Proclamation Dividing Louisiana Territory into 
Districts 

October 1, 1804 
Vincennes Indiana Gazette, Oct. 2, 180k 

By William Henry Harrison, Governor and Commander in 
Chief of the Indiana Territory, and of the District of 
Louisiana. — A PROCLAMATION : 

Whereas by an act of Congress passed the 26th day of 
March, 1804, entitled "An act erecting- Louisiana into two 
Territories, etc., providing for the temporary government 
thereof," it is declared that the district of Louisiana shall 
be divided into districts by the governor under the direction 
of the president, 

Now therefore, in conformity to the said recited law and 
the direction of the president, I do hereby make knovra and 
declare that the said district of Louisiana shall be and the 
same is hereby divided into five districts, which shall be laid 
off and bounded in the following manner, viz. : 

1st, all that part of the said district which lies above the 
Missouri river shall form one division or district, by the 
name and style of the district of St. Charles; 

2d, another district, to be called the district of St. Louis, 
shall be bounded by the Mississippi \_Missouri'] on the north, 
and on the south by Platin creek [south of St. Louis], from 
its mouth to its source, thence by a due west line to the fork 
of the Merimack [Meramec] , called the Arenean, thence down 
the said fork to the Merimack, thence up the said Merimack, 
to the upper settlements on that river, and thence by a due 
west line to the western line of Louisiana; 

3d, the district of St. Genevieve shall be bounded on the 
north by the last described boundary thro' out its whole ex- 
tent from the mouth of the Platin creek to its termination at 
the western boundary of Louisiana, and on the south by Apple 
creek, from its junction with the Mississippi, to its source, 
thence by a due west line to the western boundary of 
Louisiana ; 

4th, between the last described boundary and that which 
has hei'etofore seperated the commanderies of Cape Girardeau 
and New Madrid there shall be another district to be called 
the district of Cape Girardeau ; 

5th, all that part of the district of Louisiana which lies 



 

below the district of Cape Girardeau, shall form a fifth dis- 
trict to be called the district of New Madrid. And the seat 
of justice for the district of St. Charles, shall be at the vil- 
lage of St. Charles ; for the district of St. Louis, at the town 
of St. Louis; for the district of St. Genevieve, at the town 
of St. Genevieve; for the district of Cape Girardeau, at such 
place as may be hereafter appointed; and for the district of 
New Madrid, at the town of New Madrid. 

In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and 
caused the seal of the Indiana Territory to be affixed, at Vin- 
cennes this first day of October, in the year of our Lord, one 
thousand eight hundred and four, and of the Independence 
of the United States the twenty ninth.

Mr. Augustus Choteau' will have the Honor to deliver you

You will I am sure derive great pleasure from his Conversa-

to what is possessed by any other person & every thing that 
comes from him may be relied upon with the utmost Con- 
fidence 

It gives me great satisfaction to be able to inform you that 
nine tenths of the people of this Country are warmly attached 
to the Government of the United States. If in the Petition 
of Which Mr. Choteau is the bearer there are found expres- 
sions which appear to Contradict this opinion they must be 
attributed to the irritation produced by the insulting misrep- 
resentations of them which have been published through the

man in St. Louis. 



 

United States & to the violent language of the speeches of 
some of the members of Congress (particularly Mr. Lyons) ^ 
on the subject of the Louisiana bill. It was immagined that 
they ought not to speak of their own grievances in Terms 
more moderate than those used by persons who did not feel 
them. The people of this District wish for nothing more 
than to have a seperate Territorial Government of their own 
in the second or representative grade. If I had been so for- 
tunate as to have arrived here before the meeting was dis- 
solved which framed the petition it would have been clothed 
in very different language. 

I have devided the District of Louisiana into five Districts 
in the manner you directed & am now employed in organising 
the Courts & Militia. I have the Honor to be Dr. Sir 
with perfect esteem your Obliged Sevt.

My Children, I am surprised that you should rob one of 
your father's traders ; the man that you took the liquor from 
lately was an Englishman, and sent to trade among you by 
me; I told him to take some liquor with him to give to the 
chiefs among my children on the St. Joseph's a dram in cold 
weather when they came to see him, but not to sell any to 
you.' 

My Children, it is true that the Americans do not wish you 
to drink any spiritous liquors, therefore they have told their 
traders that they should not carry any liquor into your coun-

try — but my Children, they have no right to say that one of 
your father's traders among you should carry no liquor 
among his children. 

My Children, your father King George, loves his red chil- 
dren, and wishes his red children to be supplied with evei-y 
thing they want; he is not like the Americans, who are con- 
tinually blinding your eyes and stopping your ears, with good 
words, that taste as sweet as sugar, and getting all your lands 
from you. 

My Children, should you yet have any of the liquor that 
you took from the Englishman, I wish you to return it to him 
immediately. 

My Children, I am told that [William] Wells has told you, 
that it was your interest to suffer no liquor to come into your 
country; you all well know that he is a bad man, you all well 
know the injuries he done you before you made peace with 
the long knives, by taking and killing your men, women and 
children.

I do indeed my dear Sir, owe you an appology for not hav- 
ing written to you on the return of your courier — it was my 
intention to have answered it but before his departure I had 
not an opportunity of getting your letter explained by a per- 
son well acquainted with the French language. I was not 
sure that I perfectly understood it. I therefore postponed 
writing until an other convoy & contented myself with in- 
forming our common friend Mr. [Charles] Gratiot that I had 
received your letter as well as those which were to be for- 
warded to the Seat of the General Government.' The latter 
were all sent on by the mail succeeding their arrival — if they 
had reached me one day sooner it would have forwarded them 
one week [sooner] as one mail had set out the day before the 
arrival of your express. 

Congress have already appointed a committee to take into 
their consideration the affairs of Louisiana & I doubt not but 
a form of Government will be adopted which will prove satis- 
factory to the people of that Country. I regret exeedingly 

1. March 10, 1804 the French flag was lowered on the portico of Charles Gratiot 
and an American flag run up. Capt. Amos Stoddard took military possession. It is 
said Gratiot, a republican, called for three cheers. Stoddard did not interfere with 
affairs, merely kept order, until Oct. 1, 1804 when Harrison arrived as governor. The 
letters referred to evidently dealt with the petition read in congress Dec. 3, 1804, and 
the counter petition read Jan. 4, 1805. The report of a committee on these matters, 
John Randolph, chaii-man, was made Jan. 25, 1805. A paper is printed along with 
this report signed by L. Derbigny, P. Sauve and D. Estrehan, "agents of the in- 
habitants of Louisiana", It may be to these men that Harrison alludes in his letter.

the misfortune which has prevented you from going on to 
Washington & which has deprived the Government of a source 
of information that would I know have been much relied on. 
I do not doubt the zeal of your colleague — I believe (from 
his character) he will not be deficient in that point at least. 
But I fear that he will not be considered better qualified to 
give information on the subject of Louisiana than most of 
the members of the body to which he will address himself. 
I have omitted nothing in my power to do, to ensure success 
to the petition which you have forwarded & the way which 
appeared to me most likely to obtain it wast to counteract 
& destroy the misrepresentations which had been made re- 
specting the disposition & feelings of the people of Louisiana 
towards the Government of the United States. 

Permit me to introduce to you Col. [Return J.] Meigs [Jr.] 
the bearer of this who is appointed to the Command of the 
District of St. Charles with the rank of Colonel in the army

It would give me great pleasure to hear from you occa- 
sionally but I must be candid enough to inform you that you 
will find me a negligent & slovenly correspondent.

It is his, Ducoigne's' wish, that a part of the additional 
annuity should be laid out in the purchase of groceries, and 
a few articles of household furniture for himself — and the 
rest applied to the purchases of horses, provisions, and such 
other articles as would be necessary to fix his tribe com-

He had visited General Washington at Philadelphii 
which he proudly wore. This ostracised him among the Indians. I 
lived within the immediate vicinity of Kaskaskia. He died about

fortably in the new mode of life, which they are about to 
adopt. The old annuity furnished as many European goods 
as they wanted ; much the greater part of what they did re- 
ceive they were accustomed to sell for ardent spirits, and if 
5,000 dollars worth of those goods were given them instead 
of 500 dollars they would not be the better for it. Ducoigne 
himself is a decent, sensible, gentlemanly man, by no means 
addicted to drink, and possessing a very strong inclination to 
live like a white man ; indeed he has done so, as far as his 
means would allow. The prospect of being enabled to live 
comfortably, was the great motive with him, for selling his 
lands, and the greater part of the additional annuity could 
not be better applied than to this object. I am indeed ex- 
tremely desirous of seeing him so well situated, as to attract 
the notice of the chiefs of the other tribes, many of whom 
may probably follow his example, if they see that his situ- 
ation has been bettered by our means; I was asked this very 
day, by another, if I was not about to build a handsome house 
for Ducoigne, in such a manner as induced me to believe 
that he wished for something in the same way for himself. 

Ducoigne's long and well-proved friendship for the United 
States, of which the President is well informed, has gained 
him the hatred of all the other chiefs, and ought to be an 
inducement with us to provide, as well for his happiness, as 
his safety. He wishes to have some coffee, sugar, and choco- 
late, sent to him, and is also desirous to have a ten gallon 
keg of wine, to shew, as he says the other Indians how well 
he is treated by the United States, and how much like a 
gentleman he lives. I have published proposals for building 
his house and fence. Upon consulting with him we agreed, 
that it would be better to fence in a field of 15 acres, only, 
at first, which is full as much as his tribe will cultivate, and 
add to occasionally so as to give the quantity of fencing prom- 
ised in the treaty (Extract)

I do not consider any territorial Govr. as having any direc- 
tion of the factories or trading houses unless by particular 
and specific directions from the Presidt. of the U. S. 



 

I think that Govr. Harrison has incorrect ideas as to the 
command of the regular troops in Louisiana, for although 
the law gives the respective Commandants the command of 
the regular troops in their respective districts, it does not 
give any new authority to the Govr. over the regular troops. 
Govr. Harrison is undoubtedly intitled to an additional com- 
pensation for his services as Govr. of Louisiana, but if Detioco 
[Detroit] & uper Louisiana shall be made each a Territory, 
his services will be very much diminished in future.

Dear Sir 

It is only about 12 or 14 days ago that I received from 
My friend Mr. [John W.] Eppes [Congressman from Va.] 
an acknowledgement of the letter which accompanied your 
memorial which had been presented and refered to a com- 
mittee. He also informs me that he thinks there will be no 
doubt but the object of the Petition will be obtained so far 
as it relates to a separate Government. The Committee to 
which was referred the Memorial from New Orleans had re- 
ported in favour of granting them the rights of self govern- 
ment. Indigiiant at the charge of a breach of Treaty which 
the Memorialists have urged aginst them they refute the un-

Our Nephew 

We send to you our nephew William Patterson^ to counsel 
with you, we wish that you will listen to what he says con- 
cerning of Governor Harrison's purchasing a large Tract of 
Land, we know nothing of it, we have not in our power to 
sell land and more than that it is contrary to the articles of 
the Treaty of Greenville therefore we send to you the writing 
the governor gave us, when he gave it to us, he told us that 
it was an instrument of wi-iting to keep peace and friend- 
ship among us — therefore we wish that you will see into it 
and let the President our Father know that the purchase is 
unlegal and that he may take such measures as will prevent 
it from being settled, this is all, but you will listen to what 
Patterson says, as we cannot have all wrote what we wish to 

1. This memorial reached the House January 4, 1805. It is printed in the 
appendix to Annah 8 Cong. 2d. Sess. 160S. They protested especially against being 
tacked on to Indiana territory. Harrison favored the petition and during his gov- 
ernorship interefered as little as possible with their government, which went on much 
as it had under France. There was little friction at St. Louis as compared to that 
aroused by the captious Claiborne at New Orleans.

Dear Sir, 

By the return of a party which we sent from this place 
with dispatches, I do myself the pleasure of giving you a 
summary view of the Missouri. 

In ascending as high as the Kanzas river, which is 334 
miles up the Missouri on the S. W. side, we met a strong 
current, which was from five to seven miles an hour, the 
bottom is extensive, and covered with timber, the high coun- 
try is interspersed with rich handsome prairies well watered, 
and abound in deer and bear; in ascending as high as the 
river Plate we met a current less rapid, not exceeding six 
miles an hour; in this distance we passed several small rivers 
on each side, which water some finely diversified country, 
principally prairie, as between Vincennes and Illinois, the 
bottoms continue wide, and covered with timber: this river 
is about 6000 yards wide at the mouth, not navigable; it 
heads in the rocky mountains with the North river, and 
Yellow Stone river, and passes through an open country; 
fifteen leagues up this river the Ottoes and thirty Missouries 
live in one village, and can raise two hundred men; fifteen 
leagues higher up, the Paneas and Panea Republicans live 

2. John Connor was a most interesting character. Bom perhaps while his father 
and mother were captives among the Shawnees. When the parents were liberated 
about 1775 he was kept by the Indians. He became an Indian trader and finally 
located in Indiana. He was often employed by Harrison and it seems Harrison was 
not disappointed in the confidence he reposed in him. 

Burton, Hist. Col. 00 



HARRISON: MESSACxES AND LETTERS 119 

in one village and can raise seven hundred men ; up the wolf 
fork of this river, Papia Louises live in one village, and can 
raise two hundred and eighty men; the Indians have partial 
ruptures frequently; the river Plate is six hundred and thirty 
miles up the Missouri on the south west side. Here we find 
the antelope or goat; the next river of size ascending is the 
Stone river, commonly called by the Ingaseix, Little River 
De sious; it takes its rise in lake Dispice, fifteen miles from 
the river Demoir, and is sixty-four yards wide; here com- 
mences the Sioux country. The next by note is the Big Sioux 
river, which heads with the St. Peters, and water of lake 
Winnepic, in some high wooded country; about ninety miles, 
still higher, the river Jacque falls on the same side, and 
about 100 yards wide; this river heads with lake Winnepie, 
at no great distance east from the place, the head of the 
river Demon in Pelican lake, between the Sioux rivers and 
St. Peters; the country on both sides of the Missouri from 
the river Plate to that place has much the same appearance ; 
extensive fertile plains, containing but little timber, and that 
little, principally confined to the river bottoms and streams; 
the country east of this place, and off from the Missouri as 
low as stone river, contains a number of small trees many 
of which are said to be so much impregnated with Glauber's 
salt as to produce all its effects ; certain it is that the water 
in the small streams from the hill below on the south-west 
side possesses this quality. About the river Jaqua Bruff, the 
country contains a great amount of mineral cobalt, cinnabar, 
alum, copperas, and several other things ; the stone coal which 
is on the Missouri is very indiff"erent. Ascending fifty-two 
miles above the Jaqua, the river Quicum falls in on the south- 
west side of this river, is 1026 miles up, 150 yards wide, not 
navigable ; it heads in the black mountains, which run nearly 
parallel to the Missouri from about the head of the Kanzas 
river, and ends southwest of this place. Quicum waters a 
broken country 122 miles by water higher. White river falls 
in on the southwest side, and is 300 yards wide, and navigable, 
as all the other streams are which are not particularly men- 
tioned; this river heads in some small lakes, short of the 
black mountains. The Mahan and Poncan nations rove on 
the head of this river and the Quicum, and can raise 250 
men ; they were very numerous a few years ago, but the small- 
pox and the Sioux have reduced them to their present state ; 



 

the Sioux possess the southwest of the Missouri above White 
River, 132 miles higher and on the west side. Teton river 
falls into it, it is small, and heads in the open plains; here 
we met a large band of Sioux and the second which we had 
seen called Tetons; these are rascals, and may justly be called 
the pirates of the Missouri; they made two attempts to stop 
us; they are subdivided and stretch on the river near to this 
place, having reduced the Racres and Mandans, and driven 
them from the country they now occupy. 

The Sioux bands rove in the country to the Mississippi. 
About forty-seven miles above the Teton river, the Chyanne 
river falls in from the south-west, 4000 yards wide, is nav- 
igable to the black mountains, in which it takes its rise, in 
the third range; several bands of Indians but little known, 
rove on the head of this and the river Plate, and are stated 
to be as follows : Chaoenne 300 men ; Staetons 100 ; Canena- 
viech 400; Cayanwa and Wetahato 200, Cataha seventy De- 
tame thirty; Memesoon fifty; Castahana 1300 men; it is 
probable that some of those bands are the remains of the 
Padaucar nation; at 1440 miles up the Missouri, (and a 
short distance above two handsome rivers which take their 
rise in the black mountains,) the Kicaras live in three vil- 
lages, and are the remains of ten different tribes of Paneas, 
who have been reduced and driven from their country lower 
down by the Sioux; their number is about -500 men; they 
raise corn, beans, etc. and appear friendly and well disposed ; 
they were at war with the nations of this neighborhood, and 
we have brought about peace. Between the Recars and this 
place, two rivers fall in on the south-west and one on the 
north-east, not very long and take their rise in the open 
country ; this country abounds in a great variety of wild ani- 
mals, but a few of which the Indians take; many of those 
animals are uncommon in the United States, such as white, 
red and grey bears; long eared mules, or black tailed deer, 
(black at the end of the tail only) large heares, antelope or 
goat; the red fox; the ground prairie dogs (who burrow in 
the ground) the braroca which has a head like a dog, and 
the size of a small dog; the White brant, magpie, calumet 
eagle, etc., and many others are said to inhabit the rocky 
mountains. 

I have collected the following account of the rivers and 
country in advance of this to wit : two days march in advance 



 

of this, the Little Missouri falls on the south side, and heads 
at the north-west extremity of the black mountains ; six days 
march further a large river joins the Missouri, affording as 
much water as the Main river. This river is rapid, without 
a fall, and navigable to the rocky mountains, its branches 
head with the river Plate; the country in advance is said to 
be broken. 

The trade of the nations from this place is from the north- 
west, and Hudson's Bay establishments, on the Assinneboin 
river, distant about one hundred and fifty miles ; those traders 
are nearly at open war with each other, and better calculated 
to destroy than promote the happiness of those nations, to 
which they have latterly extended their trade, and intend to 
form an establishment near this place in the course of this 
year. 

Your most Obedient servant.

William Patterson, a Delaware, to Wells 

Fort Wayne, April 5, 1805 

Har. Pa. 170-172 

Friend and Brother! listen, to what I now say to you. I 
am sent by the chiefs of my nation, to speak the following 
words to you. 

Friend and Brother! my Chiefs take you by the hand and 
salute you and inform you that it has pleased God that they 
should see another spring. 

Friend and Brother, my chiefs inform you that their minds 
are troubled concerning the visit they made Governor Har- 
rison. Last summer at Vincennes they were invited to that 
place by the Governor and on their arrival they were much 
pleased to hear him say that he wished to brighten the chain 
of friendship between the white and red people and that he 
had invited them to see them for that purpose. 

Friend and Brother! Our chiefs was told by the Governor 
that he wish them to become more civilized and that he would 
give them an addition to their annuity of Five hundred Dol- 
lars a year to enable them to procure the necessary articles 
for the purpose of enabling them to cultivate their lands and 
that he was present when the Miamies gave all White River 



 

to the Delawares and that he would give them an instrument 
of writing that would show that the country on White River 
belonged to the Delawares. He farther told our chiefs that 
the Piankeshaws did not acknowledge the right of the Dela- 
wares to the lands on White River, but he would satisfy them 
on this head and would give them money out of his own 
pocket in order to get them to acknowledge the right of the 
Delawares to the Lands on White River, and that the road 
from Vincennes to the Falls should in future be the boundary 
line between the Lands of the Delawares and Piankeshaws. 

Friend and Brother! When these words was spoke to our 
chiefs by the governor they were much pleased with what 
he said, the Governor then wrote two papers which he told 
our chiefs contained the woi-ds he had just spoken to them 
and that he wished them to sign them both that he would 
send one to the President of the United States and one they 
could keep themselves in order that the good words he had 
spoke might be kept in remembrance by the white and red 
people — our chiefs chearfuUy signed these papers. 

Friend and Brother! you may judge how our chiefs felt 
when they returned home and found that the Governor had 
been shutting up their eyes and stopping their Ears with his 
good words and got them to sign a Deed for their lands with- 
out their knowledge. 

Friend and Brother! the Chiefs of my nation now declare 
to you from the bottom of their hearts in the presence of 
God that they never sold Governor Harrison or the United 
States any land at Vincennes last summer to their knowledge. 

Friend and Brother! My chiefs well remembers all dis- 
putes between them and the United States are to be settled 
in a peaceable manner and I am directed by them to tell you 
that they place confidence in you and it is their wish that 
you take such immediate steps as may appear to you to be 
best for bringing about a fair understanding on the subject 
of the Treaty that it appears they signed last summer at 
Vincennes, and that you as soon as possible inform our great 
father the President of the United States how Governor Har- 
rison has attempted to impose on his Red children. 

Friend and Brother! my chiefs declare to you that they 
are not willing to sell the lands on the Ohio from the mouth 
of the Wabash to Clarks Grant at the Falls and that they 



 

consider it out of their power to do any such thing without 
the consent of the other nations in this country. 

Friend and Brother! my chiefs wishes you to prevent this 
land being settled by the white people. 

Friend and Brother! these are the words that was put in 
my mouth by the chiefs of my nation, in order that I might 
deliver them to you.

Sir: 

For several weeks passed rumours of an approaching In- 
dian war on the Missouri have reached me but I am well 
convinced that there is not the smallest foundation for them. 
The Indians on this side of the Mississippi have certainly 
nothing of the kind in view. As soon as I receive any in- 
formation that can be depended on it shall be communicated. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir 
your Humble Servt

The Honorable The Secretary of War

1786: was with Wayne 1793-5; Indian agent at Fort Wayne 1800-1811 and at other 
northwestern posts 20 years longer. Paymaster in army in TT. S. Died at Washington

Dear Sir 

I have great pleasure in making you acquainted with Doctor 
Steel the bearer hereof who goes to St. Louis with the in- 
tention of settling there as a Physician. He is a gentleman 
of the most amiable character and is considered a man of 
great learning & professional talents. You will I am sure 
find him a valuable acquisition to your town & I beg leave 
to recommend him to your notice particularly. A law has 
certainly passed Congress enacting a government for Upper 
Louisiana and my most intimate friend General [James] Wil- 
kinson is certainly to be your Governor. I have not yet seen 
the law nor do I know when it is to take effect. 

With my best respect to Mr. Choteau I remain Dr Sr 
Sincerely yours, 

William H. Harrison

My Children, I have always told you that I would give you 
the earliest information of any danger that threatened you, 
that would come to my knowledge. 

My Children, there is now a powerful enemy of yours to 
the east, now on his feet, and looks mad at you, therefore you 
must be on your guard; keep your weapons of war in your 
hands, and have a look out for him.^ 

1. This seems to be a fair sample of the talk held between the British Indian 
agents and the Northwestern tribes. Most of these agents were what has been tei-med 
U. E. loyalists during the Revolution and cherished a bitter resentment toward the 
U. S. This feeling was entirely reciprocated by the western settlers who usually 
referred to them as "renegades". This "talk" was sent among the Wyandots, Ottawas. 
Pottawattomies. Shawnees, Delawares and Miamies during April, 1805. 



 

Proclamation: Calling for a New Election of Repre- 
sentatives FROM St. Clair County 

April 18, 1805 
Executive Journal, 11 

The Late Election held on the 3d of January for a Repre- 
sentative to the General Assembly for the County of St. Clair 
Being, by the resolution of the said assembly declared to be 
null and void; and by the act of Congress passed at their 
last session, the County of Wayne [Michigan] is from and 
after the 30th June next to be formed into a separate Terri- 
tory ; and in order that the said County of St. Clair [Illinois] 
may have the proportion of representatives in the Legislature 
to which its population Entitles it, and that the number of 
Representatives after the 30 June next may be made con- 
formably to the Law Creating in the Indiana Territory : The 
Governor Issued a proclamation for the holding of an elec- 
tion for the County of St. Clair, on Monday the 20th May 
next, for two persons to represent said county in the house 
of Representatives for two years after the 30th June next 
and he also makes Known and declares, that from and after 
the said 30th June next the house of Representatives of the 
Territory shall consist of seven members. [Abstract]

Sir: 

The two papers herewith enclosed I received today from 
Capt. Wells. [March 30 and Apr. 5, above] I am convinced 
that this man will not rest until he has persuaded the Indians 
that their very existence depends upon the rescinding the 
Treaty with the Delawares and Piankeshaws. My knowledge 
of his character induces me to believe that he will go any 
length and use any means to carry a favorite point and much 
mischief may ensue from his knowledge of the Indians, his 
cunning and his perseverance. If I had not informed you 
that I should wait here the arrival of your further orders I 
would set out tomorrow for Fort Wayne. I have lately learnt 



 

that Genl. [James] Wilkinson' was soon expected in the In- 
dian country- He has considerable influence with the Mianiis 
and particularly with the Turtle. I take the liberty to recom- 
mend that he may be associated with me for the purpose of 
satisfying the Indians. As soon as I receive your answer to 
my letter of the 1st ultimo unless it contains other instruc- 
tions I will proceed to Cincinnati where I can meet General 
Wilkinson in his passage down the Ohio and we can then go 
to Fort Wayne together. The interruption to the General 
will not be great and the additional expense trifling. I shall 
be obliged to take General [John] Gibson with me because I 
can get no interpreter of the Delaware language at Fort 
Wayne, that can be depended on and as he was the Inter- 
preter to the Treaty with that tribe it is necessary that he 
should be present at the explanations which take place in 
presence of the other tribes. 

If your expected letter should contain no positive instruc- 
tions on the subject of my meeting the Indians at Fort Wayne 
but should leave it to be decided by myself unless some very 
unexpected circumstance should take place I will certainly 
go on. 

I have the honor to be with great respect 
Sir your Humble Servt.

Speaker of the H. of Representatives of Indiana, a certificate 

1. James Wilkinson enlisted as a private from Penn. in Rev. on staff of Gen.

of the election of ten persons- out of whom I am to name 
five for the legislative council, the names being new to me, 
and utterly uninformed of every character, it would be to 
substitute chance for choice were I to designate the five. I 
therefore send you an instrument designating the five who 
are to compose the council, but leaving a blank for their 
names to be filled up by you. in doing this I can only rec- 
ommend an adherence to the principles which would have 
governed myself in making the selection. 1 — to reject dis- 
honest men. 2. those called federalists, even the honest men 
among them are so imbued with party prejudice, so habitu- 
ated to condemn every measure of the public functionaries 
that they are incapable of weighing candidly the pro, and the 
con, of any proposition coming from them, & only seek in it 
the grounds of opposition, their effect in the public councils 
is merely to embarrass & thwart them. 3. land-jobbers are 
undesirable, it is difficult for them, even with honest inten- 
tions, to act without bias in questions having any relation to 
their personal interests, the principle of distribution merits 
respect, where there is not too great a disparity between two 
candidates. I observe the legislature have paid a just atten- 
tion to it. those in the county of Wayne being now out of 
the territory, we have of course but 8. out of which the 5. are 
to be named. 

Your favor of Mar. 29. is just recieved. commissions issued 
early in March to the judges of Louisiana, the map of the 
Arcansa mentioned in your letter has not come with it, but 
will I suppose find it's way here, accept my thanks for it. 
we hear rumours of combinations among the Indians on both 
sides the Missisipi for objects not explained to us. I credit 
them the less as you say nothing of them, these coalitions 
merit great attention and should be prevented if possible, 
justice, favor, & interest must all be kept in activity to coun- 
teract them, liberalities and patronage to chiefs of influence 
may be necessary & cannot but have efi'ect. if each tribe 
can be satisfied that they have a sure & separate reliance on 
the justice & liberality of the government of the union, they 
will probably see their safety and prosperity better secured 

2. The ten nominated were John Rice Jones. Jacob Kuy Kendall. Samuel Gwathmey. 
Marston G. Clark, Benjamin Chambers, John Hay, Jean Francis Perrey. Pierie Menard, 
James May. James Henry. Those selected by Harrison were Chambers, Gwathmey. Jones, 
Menard and Hay. 



 

by that than by a depenclance on rival tribes : and in this they 
shall not be disappointed, the general approbation given to 
our measures respecting the Indians, shews that they ale in 
unison with the sentiments of the great body of our nation, 
& that there is no danger of a departure from them, the 
Little Turtle is indisposed, ambition will account in some 
degree for his effoi-t to produce a great confederacy; but per- 
haps we also may have been defective in our kindnesses to 
him. a liberality towards him which would not be felt by 
us, might prevent great embarrassment & expence. the Dela- 
wares & Piankishaws will of course keep aloof from these 
plots, & attached to us, because we are maintaining their 
independance. 

Accept my friendly salutations & assurances of great esteem 
& respect

Sir: 

The barge of Capt. [Meriwether] Lewis' arrived the day 
before yesterday. He has sent by this opportunity Fourty- 
five chiefs or considered of the nations Ricaras, Poncas, 
Sioux of the tribes on the Missoury, Mahas, Ottos and Mis- 
sourys, in order that they may be conducted from here to 
the Federal city. I send you an express to give you notice 

1. Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Claris expedition. The party left St. Louis 
May 14, 1804. They spent the following winter at the Mandan towns. From the upper 
Missouri this party of Indian chiefs returned to St. Louis on their way to Washington. 
Captain Lewis later became governor of Missouri. October II. 1809. while on the 
Nashville Trace, 72 miles from Nashville, he either killed himself or wa.s murdered, 
most likely the latter.

of their arrival, they unanimously wish to undertake this 
journey, but as my instructions, whereof you have a perfect 
knowledge do not permitt the departure of any Indians for 
the seat of government without a special permission, I think 
it is my duty to wait your answer, before I give them mine, 
and I hope that in the shortest time possible you will trans- 
mitt to me your orders and will direct my conduct on this 
occasion as minutely as possible. 

I will observe to you that I am ever in the same opinion 
that the warm season is very dangerous for these Indians of 
whom perhaps a great number will fall victims to so long 
and penible journey in a climate so different from their own 
and the nations should be certainly dissatisfied and would 
have a defavorable idea of the government if the Indians now 
here do not come back safely amongst them. I think that 
the autumn and Winter are the only proper seasons to under- 
take with security that trip. If you were of the same opinion 
it would be convenient, I believe, that these Indians stay here 
or not far from here, in going from time to time to hunt in 
the neighborhood. Whatever may be your opinion for the 
time of the departure I think that it will be necessary to call 
for some chiefs of the nations sakias and foxes who are 
called by the government which is already known to them, 
and also for some chiefs of the Sioux of the river Des Moens 
who are come here with Mr. Crawford- and have asked for 
the same journey, I promised to make them know the inten- 
tions of the government about it. As the expenses of the 
voyage will be in proportion to the number of the Indians 
which will amount to sixty at least perhaps you will find it 
convenient to send back to their nations some of them to 
bring the news of the Departure of the others. Finally I 
pray you to give me very particular instructions on every 
article, being desirous that my conduct may be approved. 
Fix, if you please the certain epoch of the Departure, the 
number of the Indians to be conducted, if some of them agree 
to go back, fix the road to be taken and authorize me to 
expend which sums you will judge necessary. 

I shall ever be ready to start with the Indians in all time 

2. Crawford was an Indian trader from what is now western Iowa who returned 
with this delegation of Indian chiefs. These chiefs had been prevailed on by Lewis 
at a meeting Auk. SI, 1804 to visit the president with Crawford and Pierre Durion "an 
old Frenchman" whom Lewis had taken along as an interpreter.

and if I propose you some objections on the season it is only 
to avoid any reproach from the government or from the

arrive. 

The party of Sioux conducted here by Mr. Dixon have 
started this morning satisfied of the presents which I have 
given to them. 

As the contractor is in the impossibility to furnish me with 
the provisions dayly wanted I will be obliged to buy them 
and I believe that it will be for his o^vn account. Mr. Ewing, 
an interpreter and another man wanted by him will start in 
a few days for the Sakias.

It is the opinion of the President of the United States, 
that you ought, with as little delay as possible to cause a 
meeting of the Delaware chiefs, and some of the principal 
chiefs of the Miamies and Pattawatamies, for the purpose of 
such an explanation of the doings, so much complained of, 
as will satisfy the chiefs, generally, that the transaction was 
not only open and fair, but such as they have no right to 
object to.' 

Such as the Delaware chiefs as were present at the treaty, 
and who have made false or improper representations of your 
conduct in negotiating the treaty, ought to be severely repri- 
manded, and made to acknowledge, in the presence of the 
other chiefs, the impropriety of their conduct ; and they ought 
to be told, that, in future, no chiefs, who so far degrade them- 
selves as to deny their own doings, will be considered as de- 
serving any of the confidence of their father, the President 
of the United States, or admitted to any conference with him, 
or any of his principal officers or agents.

The Indians [Sioux] have just arrived with their prison- 
ers — between thirty and forty well made, handsome, able 
bodied men presented themselves in council. They conducted 
the whole in admirable order and with more decency and 
decorum than I have ever observed among the savages. Sev- 
eral of the chiefs delivered lengthy speeches and spoke ap- 
parently in eloquent and feeling manner. All in a word 
amounted to this: that they were fools; had lost their old 
fathers ; had been lost, and had lately found their new father ; 
had by the advice of the Mississippi traders and from inclina- 
tion seized the murderer and brought him down, that they 
believed him guilty and no better than stinking flesh; still 
they hoped for pity and compassion and would cheerfully sub- 
mit to the wisdom and clemency of the Whites. The Indian 
was then presented bound, in their estimation, in a most 
ignominious manner. He evidenced strong marks of con- 
trition and a sense of his crime — confessed the murder, that 
one had struck him over the head with a pipe and then torn 
down his hut. The other man he slew for fear of being slain 
himself — and beged that compassion might be exercised in 
deciding his case ; but declared that he was resigned to what- 
ever might be his fate — that he had no doubt but it would be 
just. 

I felt affected with the magnanimity of these people. They 
are really deserving of more attentive consideration of our 
Govt. 

M. Choteau has dismissed the council to meet tomorrow 
when he gives his answer. He effected a reconciliation be- 
tween the people and a nation, arrived a short time since, 
170 leagues up the Missouri. 

M. C. has just hinted to me that he will permit them to 
return with the prisoner subject to any further [future] 
requisition that may be made by our Government. I think 
it best. We ought to have a mode of proceeding peculiar to 
the Indian character and nature — the subtleties of our law 
are not calculated for them, and we have already played the 



 

fool with the fellow lately escaped. = These people will return 
the prisoner whenever required.

Sir: 

The enclosed letter [May 22, above] from M. Choteau I 
received this day by a special messenger and have returned 
him an answer of which the enclosed is a copy (No. 2) [May 
27 below]. If the Indians should now go forward to the 
seat of Govermnent I will dispatch them as quickly as pos- 
sible. On their arrival at this place I will have them innocu- 
lated with the vaccine disease that they may avoid the small 
pox which is at this time in Kentucky. I have directed Mr. 
Choteau to go on with them because he is better acquainted 
with their manners and their wants than any other person 
that could be procured. A party of the Sioux of the Mis- 
sissippi have lately visited St. Louis for the purpose of de- 
livering up one of their warriors who had killed two Canadi- 
ans, the Servants of a trader in their country, but upon ex- 
amination it appeared that the Indian killed them in his owni 
defence and that they were the aggressors. He was accord- 
ingly permitted to return with his friends upon condition of 
his being delivered up at any time hereafter when he should 
be demanded. Inclosed (No. 3) is a letter from a friend of 
mine on the spot which gives a particular account of the 
transaction. The respect which has been manifested towards

to our affairs in that quarter and forms a striking contrast 
to the conduct of some of the more neighbouring Tribes which 
have been treated by our government with the utmost tender- 
ness and indulgence. In my last letter I informed you that 
it was my intention to set out for Fort Wayne unless the in- 
structions I expected to receive from you should otherwise 
direct. Upon more mature deliberation I have been induced 
to abandon my opinion of the propriety of that step. First 
from the probability that my services will shortly be required 
here to hold a session of the Legislature and secondly Be- 
cause I think it would be a sacrifice of that dignity and au- 
thority which it is necessaiy to observe in all our transac- 
tions with the Indians. We are not conscious of having done 
them any wrong but as they pretend to think otherwise they 
have been invited to come forward and state their grievances 
and every assurance has been given that for any injury which 
may have unintentionally been done them ample remuneration 
shall be made. As they have declined this invitation I think 
it would be improper for us to discover too much solicitude 
to give them satisfaction lest they would attribute that to 
fear which is purely the effect of justice and benevolence, 
an error which the Indians above all the people in the world 
are prone to imbibe. As it is very possible however that they 
may have been imposed upon by false statements and mis- 
representations I conceived it to be a matter of importance 
to remove from their minds every false impression to ascer- 
tain whether the uneasiness and alarm really exists amongst 
them to the extent that has been spoken of and to discover 
who the persons are (for that there are such I am perfectly 
convinced) who excite their jealousy and feed their discon- 
tent. For these purposes I have dispatched General [John] 
Gibson to the Delawares and Col. [Francis] Vigo^ to the 
Miamis and Potawatomies. Upon their return I shall be 
enabled to give you satisfactory information on every sub- 
ject connected with their mission. 

In the course of this spring I have seen all the cheifs of 
the Weas one excepted a large deputation from the Kickapoos 
of the Prairie another from those of the Vermilion River.

Almost the whole band of Eel River Indians and the only 
chief of the Delawares who was not present at the late treaty 
with that Tribe. In none of these have I discovered the 
smallest signs of discontent and I am persuaded that if it 
does exist it exists no where but in the immediate neighbor- 
hood of Fort Wayne and the Indians there are no more 
effected by the Treaties with the Delaware and Piankeshaws 
than the Mandans of the Missouri. 

I received by the express from St. Louis a long letter from 
Capt. [William] Clark- the companion of Capt. [Meriwether] 
Lewis. The dispatches for the President and for your de- 
partment were not sent on which will delay their arrival at 
Washington nearly a fortnight. They passed the Winter with 
the Mandans 1609 miles up the Missouri in latitude 47° 21' 
47" N. Longitude 101° 25' and had met with no material 
accident. 

Your letter of the Febry. covering the President's 

Pardon of the Sac Indian confined at St. Louis did not reach 
me until near two months after its date. It was immediately 
forwarded to St. Louis but unfortunately it did not arrive 
until the Indian had effected his escape from the guard house. 
He was fired on by the sentinel and the body of an Indian 
has lately been found near St. Louis with the marks of the 
buck shot in his head which is supposed to be the prisoner.^

Hai: Pa. 138 

Sir: 

I have this moment received your favour of the 22nd in- 
stant. The arrival of the Indians from the upper parts of 
the Missouri at this particular time is certainly an unfor- 
tunate circumstance. After as full a consideration of the 
affair as the time mil allow I have determined as follows: 
You will please to state to the Indians the inconveniences 
that will attend their going on at present and explain to them 
your arrangement for their spending the summer in the neigh- 
borhood of St. Louis. If they should readily agree to it that 
plan will be adopted. If on the contrary they should express 
a wish to go on you will proceed immediately to make the 
necessary arrangements and set out for this place with all 
the expedition in your power — expedition is the more neces- 
sary as the President and the Heads of Departments will be 
absent from the seat of Government after the month of June. 
It is impossible for me at this distance to prescribe to you in 
the detail the arrangements necessary for your outfit in this 
Trip. I must therefore leave it entirely to yourself relying 
upon your judgment and economy that no expenses vdll be 
gone into but such as the due execution of the object requires. 
I therefore hereby authorize you to draw upon the Secretary 
of War for such sums as may be required for the purchase 
of Horses and other necessaries for the Trip. On your ar- 
rival at this place you will receive more particular instruc- 
tions. If any engagement for interpreters has been made 
and no particular objection can be made to their integi-ity 
or capacity you will please to employ them. An English in- 
terpreter ^v^ll also be necessary. You will also please to apply 
to Major [John] Bruff' for an escort as far as this place 
where you will be furnished with one to take you to the Ohio. 
I wish very much to send on a few of the Sioux, of the De- 
moin, and some of Sacs and Foxes and if you can get them

ready to go on with the others do so. Every exertion in your 
power must be made to diminish the number by sending back 
as many of those that have come down the Missouri as you 
can get to go back. Give them a few articles that will be 
acceptable to them and send them with a speech to their na-

Detroit, June 14, 1805 

Farmer, History of Detroit and Michigan 

Sir: 

I have the painful task to inform you of the entire con- 
flagration of the town of Detroit. About ten o'clock on Tues- 
day last a stable, immediately opposite the factory was dis- 
covered on fire. The first intimation I had of it was the 
flames bursting through the doors and windows of the house ; 
I immediately gave the alarm, and with great exertion saved 
my papers and about two thirds of the goods of the factory; 
my private property was entirely consumed. 

In less than two hours the whole town was in flames, and 
before three o'clock not a vestage of a house (except the 
chimneys) visible within the limits of Detroit. The citadel 
and military stores were entirely consumed, and the furniture 
belonging to the estate of Colonel [John F.] Hamtramck, 
shared nearly the same fate; the china is the only thing I 
can mention to the contrary. 



 

I have removed the factory goods to the ship yard, and am 
now fixing a place to arrange them for disposal, agreeable to 
the original intention of the establishment, and I will speed- 
ily forward a statement of the loss that has been sustained. 
The situation of the inhabitants is deplorable beyond descrip- 
tion; dependence, want and misery is the situation of the 
former inhabitants of the town of Detroit. Provisions are 
furnished by contributions, but houses cannot be obtained. 

Mr. Dodemead lives in a corner of the public storehouse at 
the shipyard. Mr. Donavan with his family have gone to 
Sandwich; and Mr. Audrain, with many others, occupy the 
small house below Mr. May's. A number of families are 
scattered over the commons without any protection or shelter. 

I have been very much bruised and hurt by my exertion 
to save the property. My right arm particularly is so much 
swelled that I can hardly hold the pen to write these few 
lines, and my mind is equally affected with the distressing 
scenes I have witnessed for the last three days. 
I am, Sir, your ob't Serv't

Indian Council 

Fort Wayne, June 21, 1805 

Har. Pa. H2-1U 

Minutes of a Council held at Fort Wayne on the 21st day 
of June 180.5 by General [John] GiBSON and Colonel [Fran- 
cis] Vigo present the Delawares, Eel River and Miami In- 
dians. 

Genl. Gibson 

Governor Harrison your Father has sent Col. Vigo and 
myself to speak to you, what we say you may consider as 
coming from him, he is appointed by your great Father the 
President of the U. S. sole commissioner to transact business 
with his red children, within the Indiana Territory, he has 
heard that a number of bad people has circulated a number 
of bad stories among you, he has also heard that your hearts 
are uneasy about it, that you cannot rest. In order to wipe 
off the impressions made by those bad reports your Father 
the Governor wishes the Tribes here present to send some of 
the principal chiefs to Vincennes to see him, he wishes us to 



 

assure you that the intentions of your Father towards you 
is good and that your interest and happiness is near to his 
heart. When you come to see him he will be able to remove 
all the uneasiness from your minds. In the meantime he de- 
sires you not to listen to any bad stories or any lying birds 
that may be flying about. We now request you to fix upon 
the time when it will be convenient for you to come and see 
the Governor, in order that he may have everything ready 
for your accommodation, we will set off in two nights and 
would be happy to know what time you can set off — this is 
all we have at present to say to you. 

Hockingpomskou [a Delaware] 
I am very glad to hear what you have said to us. You may 
depend on my going to Vincennes where I expect to have an 
opportunity of delivering my sentiments. 

The Little Turtle 
I have listened to what you have said to us, the Miamis 
wishes for time to consider on the subject of your speech. 
We hope you will not think hard at our not making up our 
minds immediately. We want to consult the Eel River In- 
dians who have just come in (at this time the Miamis and 
Eel River Indians retired from the Council in about an hour 
they returned when the Little Turtle proceeded). Your chil- 
dren has listened to your words and to the words of their 
great Father thro you, they have consulted together in what 
you have said and they are afraid you are tired of waiting. 
I have nothing to say to you. I am no Miami. I am only 
their interpreter. We can form no opinion at present on 
what you have said to us. We think it absolutely necessary 
to consult the Potawatomies before we can come to any con- 
clusion about the time we are to go to Vincennes. You will 
tell our Father the Governor the weather is now very warm 
and that we cannot say at what time we can come to see him. 
The Indians that live on the Wabash are convenient and can 
go along at any time, we wish to consult the Indians in this 
quarter before we come to a conclusion. 

General Gibson 
We wish that after consulting the Potawatomies and when 
you fix upon the time to come forward that you send your 



 

Father the Governor infoimation in order that he may be 
prepared to receive you. It is true the weather is now very 
warm but we hope that will not prevent you from coming 
forward as soon as possible to set all to right. 

Little Turtle 
We wish not to be hurried, we think it a matter of im- 
portance. We think we have reason to complain and we wish 
for time to deliberate on the subject. 

Richerville [Miami] 
I should wish to attend the call of the Governor but my 
business calls me in another direction. The Indians are slov/ 
in their deliberations and vdsh for time. 
Council adjourned 

In coming from the Council House to the Fort the Pucon 
[Miami] halted General Gibson and Col. Vigo and addressed 
them as follows: 

The Little Turtle has said that we wished for time to de- 
liberate on what you have said to us, he (the Pucon) did not 
want to deliberate. He wanted to go on to Vincennes now 
and would go at any time. The Turtle had no right to say 
the Indians wanted time to think on it, that was not the case, 
he said he would speak again to Genl. Gibson and Col. Vigo.

Dear Sir : 

I have been this moment requested by the Miamis and Eel 
River Indians to make the following communication to you in 
writing. 

They say that they have no doubt but the governor has sent 
you and Col. [Francis] Vigo to call them to Vincennes but it 
appears absolutely necessary to them that you should show 
them your \vTitten instructions from the governor for that 
purpose. Should you not be instructed in writing by the 



 

Governor to give them this invitation that you would be 
pleased to inform the governor on your arrival at Vincennes 
that they wish him to confirm what you told them yesterday 
as they wished to embrace the first opportunity of making 
their sentiments known to the United States respecting the 
late treaty of Vincennes and in the meantime they would get 
themselves in readiness to meet the governor at Vincennes. 
I am requested to obtain your answer to this communication 
in writing. It appears that the Little Turtle was requested 
to wait on you this morning and to make this communication 
to you which he says he has done but has his doubts whether 
you understood him or not. [Enclosed with letter July 12, 
1805] 

I have the honor to be Sir 

your most obdt.

Gentlemen : 

An arduous public service assigned you by the General 
Government of the United States, is about to cease. The eve 
of the anniversary of American Independence will close the 
scene : and on that celebrated festival will be organized, under 
the most auspicious circumstances a goverment for the ter- 
ritory of Louisiana. Local situations and circumstances for- 
bid the possibility of a permanent political connexion. This 
change, however congenial to our wishes and conductive to 
our happiness, will not take effect without a respectful ex- 
pression of our sentiments to you, gentlemen, for your as- 
siduity, attention, and disinterested punctuality, in the tem- 
porary administration of the government of Louisiana. 

Accept our thanks, gentlemen, the tribute of sincerity due 
to you for your just and impartial administration of the 
government of this country during the period assigned to 
you by our national legislature. We wish you a long and 
happy administration of the government of the territory 



 

of Indiana, and that the citizens of that territoiy may justly 
appreciate your worth, talents, and services with the same

We the officers of the militia, in the District of St. Louis, 
with the knowledge we have of your patriotic sentiments and 
private virtues, and convinced of the high esteem you enter- 
tain for our welfare, are desirous that, at the moment you 
cease to preside over us, the most lively expressions of our 
regret should reach you, especially as our zeal to support the 
Constitution of the United States has inspired your confi- 
dence. Permit us to observe, that you have, in part fulfilled 
our wishes ; but the limited period of your administration has 
prevented the full completion of them ; and whatever may be 
left unfinished by you, we are confident will be attended to, 
and completed, by the high and enlightened character that 
succeeds you. 

Accept, sir, these sentiments as the pledge of our affection- 
ate attachment to you, and to the magnanimous policy by 
which you have been guided. May the Chief Magistrate of 
the American nation duly estimate your worth and talents, 
and long keep you in a station where you may have it in your

Sir: 

In pursuance of the instructions we received from your 
Excellency we proceeded to the Indian Towns on the Wabash 



 

River, on our road we passed the Town of the Eel river In- 
dians at the river of Le Rabellaire [La Riviere Petite?] they 
were all drunk, excepting one of their chiefs named Sam [or 
Metausauner] . We told him we wished to speak to him and 
the other chiefs, he replied that they were all drunk, but as 
they intended going to Fort Wayne in a few days to receive 
their annuity, they would at that place hear what we had to 
say to them. We then proceeded to the To\vti of Massasinewa 
on the Wabash river where we saw the Five Medals, a Chief 
of the Potawatamies, we informed him of the nature of our 
Mission in the words as delivered to the Council at Fort 
Wayne; he then informed us he intended going to Detroit 
in a few days, but that another Chief of his tribe would go 
to Vincennes, agreably to your request. At this place we 
saw the Pakaun and Hibou or the Owl, two of the Chiefs of 
the Miamies and heads of this Village. The latter of whom 
was very sick. We informed them we were sent by you and 
wished to speak to them, they informed us one of their Chiefs 
Pussewa or Richardville was gone to Fort Wayne, and as 
they intended going to that place in a few days they would 
at that place hear what we had to say to them. 

At this place I parted from Col. Vigo and proceeded to 
the Delaware towns on White River. Previous to my arrival 
there I heard of the Death of the Great Chief and Warrior 
Bokongehalas.^ I informed Telabuxika the other Chief of the 
Delawares that I was sent by you and that I had a message 
to deliver to them from you and requested them to send for 
the other chiefs. The next day the Chiefs assembled, except 
Keehlawhenund or William Anderson whose wife being dead 
prevented his coming. When I addressed them and informed 
them, that you were very sorry to hear that they the Dela- 
wares had denied that they had sold any Lands to the United 
States the last Summer and that you (with my assistance) 
had defrauded and cheated them. I then repeated every 
transaction that took place at the Treaty and told them that 
they had in the most fair and solemn manner sold the lands 
last summer to the United States and that the Treaty had 
been ratified by the President and Senate of the United States 
and that their denying it was of no effect, and would only

an error. The same statements are found in Dawson's Harrison. He was able to sign 
the treaties of 1809, 1814, 1818. and out in Kansas that of 1829; Peters, Indian Treaties 



 

make them appear in a ridiculous light in the eyes of all the 
nations, and would lessen them very much in the great esteem 
and respect the United States had for them. I also told them 
White Eyes-' one of their Chiefs who had signed the Treaty, 
had told their young men that they the Chiefs had sold the 
Lands to the United States and the Chiefs were afraid to 
own it. I then asked them for the Copy of the Treaty which 
was given to them at Vincennes last summer. They informed 
me that they had left it in the hands of Mr. Wells at Fort 
Wayne and they said they would council together and speak 
to me. Soon after they sent for me, when Telabuxika de- 
livered the answer. We did not sell any lands to the United 
States last summer at Vincennes ; the Goods we received there 
were a condolance present and to pay for horses which your 
people stole from us. He trembled and appeared very much 
agitated and confused whilst speaking. He said they were 
going to Fort Wayiie in a few days to receive their annuity 
and that on their return they would pay you a visit. I then 
spoke to them again and told them that I was sorry to find 
they had denied the Truth, that they had known me many 
years, and I never deceived them and that as several of their 
people understood English very well, it was impossible for 
me as Interpreter to deceive them. I told them the Bounds 
of the Lands was first pointed out to them by me on paper, 
viz. the road leading from Vincennes to Clarksville. the White 
River, the Ohio and the Wabash rivers, and repeatedly ex- 
plained by me to them, and that the Governor had in the 
presence of the Witnesses who signed the Treaty explained it 
to them. I then told them I would go to Fort Wayne as they 
had left the Treaty there and would speak to them again at 
that place. After the council a number of their principal 
warriors and young men came to me. They said that they 
were sorry that their chiefs had behaved so foolishly as to 
deny the Truth and that they were convinced that they had 
sold the Land and were afraid to own it, that White Eyes had 
told them so and they also said that the Little Turtle and 
Wells had said the sum specified in the Treaty was a mere 
nothing and that they were cheated and imposed on. I then 
set off for Fort Wayne. On the road I was joined by Hock- 

ne as he variously signed his 



144 INDIANA HISTOKICAL COLLECTIONS 

ingpomskan one of the chiefs who signed the Treaty. In 
conversation he told me that they had sold the land that he 
intended going to Vincennes to settle everything with the 
Governor. I joined Col. Vigo at Fort Wayne; after the In- 
dians arrived we held a council with them the Minutes of 
which are marked, (a). Previous to the council I called on 
Mr. Wells and asked him for the copy of the Treaty, I then 
spoke to the Delawares who were present, showed them the 
Treaty, pointed out the Bounds of the Land they had sold 
and I told them that when the Council met I intended to 
mention it to them. The Delawares requested me not to men- 
tion it in Council as everything would be settled when they 
came to Vincennes. Pakaun and Richardville two of the 
Miami Chiefs came to Col. Vigo and me and informed us 
that as soon as Richardville returned from Detroit, which 
would be in twenty-five days, that they would set out for 
Vincennes. The Little Turtle came to us and informed us 
that since he said as in council they had agreed to set off 
for Vincennes in 25 days he went over the river the same 
night to Mr. Wells. In the morning he returned and de- 
manded our Instructions. I told him mine were verbal from 
you that I was an officer of the Government which he well 
knew and that Col. Vigo and myself would not dare to say 
anything unless we had been sent by you. Shortly after I 
received the Letter marked (73) from Mr. Wells. The Mi- 
amies mentioned in the letter had set off early in the morn- 
ing and we believe knew nothing of the Letter, and we think 
the same was fabricated by the Little Turtle and Wells. At 
the Time I explained the Treaty to the Delawares at Fort 
Wayne Wm. Wells was present. He spoke to the Delawares 
and told them that they need not be afraid to own that they 
had sold the Land as they the delawares had only sold their 
right and that it could not affect the claim of the other In- 
dians. I then asked Mr. Wells whether he recollected Bo- 
kongehalas in the presence of the Potawatamie chiefs 2 years 
ago having informed you that the Pakaun, the Owl, Chiefs 
of the Miamies and the Chiefs of the Eel river Indians had 
confirmed the claim of the delawai-es to the Lands which was 
given to them by the Piankshaws and that he showed the 
Wampum delivered on the occasion. Mr. Wells replied he 
did not recollect it. On Col. Vigo's arrival at Fort Wayne 



 

he went to see Lieut. [John] Bronson^ the commanding offi- 
cer. Mr. Wells came in and he Col. Vigo mentioned he was 
sorry for the death of Bokongehalas the Delaware Chief, as 
he was a great man and that he would be much missed by his 
nation. At the same time he said it was a pity he had tar- 
nished his character by telling a Lye in denying his having 
sold the Lands to the United States. Mr. Wells replied and 
said, he dare say the Lands were fairly sold and that if he 
Bekongehalas had told a Lie it was a Lie of necessity. Short- 
ly after Lieut. Bronson remarked in conversation that Mr. 
Wells had altered his tone very much, that he Lieut. Bronson 
had heard Wells repeatedly say the Indians were very much 
imposed on at the late treaty at Vincennes. Monsieur Rich- 
ardville [Miami Chief] in conversation informed Col. Vigo 
that when they were receiving their annuity Mr. Wells ad- 
dressed the Miamies and advised them to stick together and 
keep their right, that he Wells if he was a Miamie would do 
so; afterwards Richardville in conversation told Col. Vigo 
that he was much supprised to hear an officer who had taken 
an oath in the manner Wells had done to support the Govern- 
ment of the United States express himself in the manner 
Wells had done. Mr. [John] Johnson the Factor of the United 
States at Fort Wayne informed us that Mr. Wells had re- 
peatedly said that the Indians would never approve of the 
Treaty of last summer and he Mr. Johnson as well as every 
other gentleman with whom we conversed in that place were 
of the opinion that there never would have been any noise" 
about the Treaty had it not been occasioned by the Little 
Turtle and Wells. On our Meeting the Five Medals at Mas- 
sasinawa, we asked him if he had come from his Village. 
He replied that he came from Fort Wayne with a keg of 
Whiskey, which keg' he got from Mr. Wells. The Indians all 
got drunk at that Village. On our seeing Richardville at Fort 
Wayne we mentioned it to him, he said he was much sup- 
prised that Wells would give Liquor to other Indians to make 
his people drunk when he Wells would not even suffer him 
to take a single bottle for his own use, and had seized Liquor 
belonging to the Owl, which he was bringing from Detroit.

The Indian chiefs will certainly come at the Time they prom- 
ised unless they are prevented by the Little Turtle and Wells, 
who we believe will do everything- in their power to prevent 
their coming. We beg further to add as our own opinion 
that no noise or clamour respecting the Treaty last summer 
with Delawares at this place would have been made had it 
not been occasioned by the Little Turtle and Wells, the latter 
of whom seems more attached to the Indians than to the 
people of the United States. In the several towns which we 
passed thro, the Indians although drunk in almost every one 
of them behaved in the most friendly manner to us and never 
once mentioned the Treaty, or anything respecting it. Rich- 
ardville also informed us that the Little Turtle in the pres- 
ence of Wells produced a paper and requested Richardville 
to sign it. Being a remonstrance to the President of the 
United States in favour of Mr. Wells, he Richardville re- 
fused to sign it saying that if Mr. Wells had behaved well 
there was no occasion for to write to the president in his 
favour that he did not wish to interfere in matters which 
belonged entirely to the White people, and that he the Little 
Turtle had frequently wrote letters to the president, without 
their being consulted or asked to sign them. 

We have the Honour to be very respectfully your Excel- 
lency's most obedient and very humble servants

In passing thro several of the Indian Towns we heard of a 
Speech or Talk which was said to be sent to the Indians by 
the British, the purport of which was in addressing them. 

My Children, 

I promised that whenever I heard anything relating to you 
I would inform you. I have been traveling through a great 
many nations. I see a great stonn rising in the south which 
may affect you My Children 

I desire you not to be alarmed, plant your corn and do not 
quit your towns. But keep your guns ready in your hands. 
Mr. Wells showed us a speech which he said was sent to the 
Indians by Capt. [Alexander] McKee at Maiden but of this 



 

we heard nothing of amongst the Indians we are inclined to 

think it was fabricated by himself.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

Vincennes 10th July, 1805 

Har. Pa. H6-151 

Sir: 

General [John] Gibson and Col. Francis Vigo returned a 
few days since. Inclosed herewith is the report of their pro- 
ceedings. [See June 21 above] If the Indians should come 
to this place as they have promised you need be under no 
apprehension of having the affair of the Delaware Treaty 
settled to the satisfaction of the President. 

A person situated as Mr. Wells is might have thwarted the 
measures of the government for years without being de- 
tected but altho possessed of a good deal of cunning he has 
so entangled himself in the mazes of his own intrigues that 
he cannot move without making disclosures that are fatal to 
him. [See Wells to Vigo, June 22] I could freely forgive 
him for the past if there was any security for his future 
good conduct but I believe that he is still doing his utmost 
to prevent a favorable issue to the proposed conference with 
the Indians. The visit of the Five Medals to Mississiniway 
with a keg of whisky given him by Wells was for no other 
purpose than to counteract General Gibson and Col. Vigo or 
to procure the signatures of the Indians to the recommenda- 
tion of Wells which the Miami chief refused to sign at Fort 
Wayne. 

Being fully persuaded that firmness and decision are abso- 
lutely necessary in every transaction with Indians I shall 
state to them in the most explicit manner that the United 
States are determined to keep possession of the land ceded 



 

by the Delaware and Piankeshaw Treaties as they are fully 
satisfied as well of the fairness of the transaction as of the 
right of those tribes to sell. If we recede one inch these 
people ^vill be never satisfied until they have gained the ell. 
A respectable citizen of the state of Ohio came to this place 
a few days ago and informed me that in his Journey he had 
stopped at a camp of Delawares, with one of whom who spoke 
good English he had a long conversation respecting the 
Treaty. The Indian informed him that some of the chiefs of 
the other Tribes were very angry \vith the Delawares for 
selling the land without including them and the Delaware 
chiefs had been informed that if they would deny having 
made the Treaty a new one would be made, and a much 
larger consideration given. He further observed that the 
chiefs were very much laughed at by some of the white peo- 
ple in their country for having sold so valuable a country 
for so contemptable a sum. I am convinced that a certain 
[John] Conner and one [Peter] Audrian' who trades with 
the Delawares have acted as Well's agents in this affair and 
this is also the opinion of Col. Vigo (Genl. Gibson however 
thinks otherwise with regard to Conner who he says behaved 
very well when he was at the Delaware towns). They have 
both very advantageous contracts from Wells for making 
rails for the Indians. Audrain altho established within a 
few miles of the Falls of the Ohio has found it to his ad- 
vantage to undertake the making of rails at the Turtle's Town 
north of Fort Wayne. The Chiefs of the Mississineway Mi- 
amis, complained to Col. Vigo that they do not receive a 
proper proportion of the annuities of their Tribe ; altho they 
compose two thirds of the Tribe they received this year but 
$400. In short, Sir, I am really of opinion that the Turtle, 
the Five Medals and two or three others receive much the 
greater part of the annuities and provisions which are in- 
tended for and said to be given to the Potawatomies and 
Miamis and I am by no means certain that Wells himself 
does not largely participate. The fact is admitted that he 
makes more money than any man in the Territory. Mr. 
[John] Johnston told Col. Vigo that he cleared last year up-

wards of $6000. How he can do this honestly I am at a loss 
to know. I think that measures ought to be taken to control 
this vicious inclination or to remove him from office and from 
the Indian country. I had determined to inform him of the 
suspicions which had arisen against him and to order him 
to come to this place for the purpose of explaining his con- 
duct but I thought it best to delay it until I could receive 
your instructions. If an inquiry would be made into his con- 
duct I must beg leave to recommend that General [James] 
Wilkinson may assist at it. It will be very little trouble for 
the General to come over to this place for a few days and I 
am satisfied the trip would not be disagreeable to him. 

If the management of the Indian Department is replaced 
upon the footing of your general instructions of the 23rd of 
February 1802 i. e. that all the Agents and Sub Agents would 
be immediately accountable to and make their reports to the 
superintendent alone I will answer with my head to execute 
every wash of the President relative to the Indians in this 
quarter. 

I have understood that it was intended to sell immediately 
the United States land around Fort Wayne. I am very cer- 
tain however that the money which will be put into the Treas- 
ury by the sale of it will not counterbalance the inconveniences 
which will arise from having it settled with the description 
of people who will naturally buy it. It is too far removed 
from any other settlement to entice Ainerican farmers to go 
there but the few sections that are sold will be purchased by 
the Indian traders and we shall then have in the Heart of 
the Indian country a number of unprincipled people who will 
be entirely out of the reach of the laws of the United States 
regulating the Trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes. 
If the immediate settlement of it is an object I think it would 
be better to sell it by contract upon the condition that there 
would be within a given time a certain number of American 
farmers upon it. 

[Billy] Patterson the Delaware who made the speech to 
Wells was present at every conference pending the Treaty 
and also at the signing of it and he understands English as 
well as his native tongue. George White Eyes one of the 
Chiefs who signed the Treaty also speaks English indeed 
there are few Delawares that do not understand something 
of it 



 

Before this letter comes to hand you will have heard of 
the dreadful conflagration at Detroit. [Munro to Harrison 
June 14 above] One third of the factory goods were de- 
stroyed and they would all have been burned if Mr. [Robert] 
Munro had not been more attentive to them than to his o^vn 
property of which he lost the whole.-' 

I received some time since a letter from the Factory at 
Fort Wayne enclosing a certificate of several officers who 
were called upon to examine the public goods. They report 
that a considerable number of those which have lately been 
sent on were entirely damaged and that many of them were 
altogether unfit for the Indian Trade. The Piankeshaw and 
Wea annuities which I received this Spring were also in a 
most wi-etched state, a considerable portion of these for the 
latter were actually rotten in consequence of their being sent 
on in boxes instead of tight casks. Under present circum- 
stances I thought it proper to make the chiefs some retri- 
bution in saddles, etc and to the principal I gave an eligant 
rifle, these presents and the kind treatment they received 
had such an eflPect upon them that I am persuaded they would 
have done anything I requested. Parties were dispatched in 
all directions to bring in stolen horses and the persons who 
went in pursuit of them had orders from the chiefs to bring 
the horses or the scalps of those who took them. The pres- 
ents to those people and those to the two large parties of 
the Kickapoos of the Prairie who visited me in the latter 
part of the Winter has advanced the half yearly contingent 
account a few hundred dollars higher than usual. The money 
has not however been misapplied. Mr. Wells very improperly 
retained the Kickapoos annuity and wrote to me that he will 
send for these Tribes to Fort Wayne and justifies himself by 
informing me that by your order the annuities for the Kicka- 
poos would be sent to Chicago in future. I have however 
directed them to send them here from a conviction that he 
wanted them at Fort Wayne for no other purpose than to 
obtain their remonstrance also against the Delaware treaty. 

The first representative legislature of the Indiana Terri- 
tory will meet in a fortnight. I shall do everything in my

P. S. I have opened my letter to acknowledge the receipt of 
yours of the 20th ultimo (that of the 11th had been previ- 
ously received and Mr. Wells instructed accordingly) the 
greater part of the paragraphs in the papers respecting com- 
binations of the Indians are mere fabrications. The Sacs and 
the Southern Indians have attempted to form a grand con- 
federation against the Osages and the Delawares and the 
Shawnese of Cape Girardeau have acceded to it. I believe 
however that none of the Tribes in this Territory have en- 
gaged in it. The subject has engaged my attention and will 
not be neglected. I shall consult with Genl. Wilkinson as 
you have directed.

Dear Sir 

I received your vei-y friendly letter by the last mail from 
St. Louis — Believe me sincere when I assure you that I re- 
ciprocate the sentiments of regard and attachment which 
you were so obliging as to express for me. Indeed the polite- 
ness and attention which I received from your self and all 
the members of your family have made a lasting impression 
on me and I would have been equally ungrateful as unjust 
not to have impressed my friend General [James] Wilkinson 
with the same sentiments toward you which I feel. A friend- 
ship with that gentleman which known no reserves and which 
had its commencement when I was yet a youth gave me an 
opportunity of expressing all I felt with regard to your coun- 
try and the characters in it. It will give me great pleasure 
to hear from you occasionally. Please to present me in the 



 

most respectf uly manner to Mrs. Choteau and believe me Sin- 
cerely your friend

Harrison's Address to the General Assembly 

July 29, 1805 
Dawson, Hwrrison, 71-7(1 

The sincerity of the congratulations which I offer you, 
fellow citizens, upon entering on a grade of government which 
gives to the people the important right of legislating for 
themselves, is sufficiently manifested by the ready sanction 
I have given to their wishes and the promptitude with which 
the organization has been effected.' The long and protracted 
investigation which preceded the first adoption of this meas- 
ure, on the part of your constituents, proclaims it to be the 
result of deliberation and reflection, and exhibits a temper 
and judgment which do them great honor and cannot fail to 
produce the most salutary effects. On you, however, it rests, 
gentlemen, to realize the wishes of those who were friendly 
to the second grade of government, to disappoint the fears 
of its enemies, and to show that every approximation towards 
a republican system is attended with a certain and solid ad- 
vantage. Our means, however, are far from being equal to 
the support of an expensive establishment; and it would be 
equally impolitic and unjust to tax the incipient exertions of 
the settlers with more than they could conveniently pay ; and 
it would have the certain effect of diverting from us the tide 
of emigration, upon which are founded all our hopes of po- 
litical emancipation. 

Upon a careful review of our situation, it will be found 
that we have great cause of felicitation, whether it respects 
our present enjoyments or our future prosperity. An en- 
lightened and generous policy has for ever removed all cause

is the first message of the Governor to an Indiana legislature. In the preceding procla- 
mation dates are given for the passage of the Territory from the first to the second 
grade. This Assembly sat from July 29 to August 26, 1805. It passed thirty-two laws, 
two resolutions, and one charter. Dunn, Indiana 325, 277; Dillon, Indiana, 416; Esarey,

of contention with our western neighboi's. The mighty river 
which separates us from the Louisianians will never be 
stained with the blood of contending nations; but will prove 
the bond of our nation, and will convey upon its bosom, in 
a course of many thousand miles, the produce of our great 
and united empire.- The astonished traveller will behold, 
upon either bank, a people governed by the same laws, pur- 
suing the same objects, and warmed with the same love of 
liberty and science. And if, in the immense distance, a small 
point should present itself where other laws and other man- 
ners prevail, the contrast it will afford will serve the useful 
purpose of demonstrating the great superiority of a repub- 
lican government, and how far the uncontrolled and un- 
biassed industry of freemen excels the cautious and measured 
exertions of the subjects of despotic power. ^ 

The acquisition of Louisiana will indeed form an important 
epoch in the history of our country. It has secured the hap- 
piness of millions, who will bless the moment of their emanci- 
pation and the generous policy which has secured to them the 
rights of man. To us it has produced immediate and impor- 
tant advantages. We are no longer apprehensive of waging 
an eternal war with the numerous and warlike tribes of 
aborigines which surround us, and perhaps being reduced to 
the dreadful alternative of submitting to their depredations 
or of exterminating them from the earth. 

By cutting off their communication with every foreign 
power, and forcing them to procure from ourselves the arms 
and ammunition, and such of the European manufactures as 
habit has to them rendered necessary, we have not only se- 
cured their entire dependence, but the means of ameliorating 
their own conditions and of devoting to some useful and 
beneficial purpose the ardor and energy of mind which are 
now devoted to war and destruction. 

The policy of the United States with regard to the savages 
within their territories forms a striking contrast to the con- 
duct of other civilized nations. The measures of the latter 
appear to have been well calculated for the effect which has 
produced the entire extirpation of the unhappy people whose 
country they have usurped. It is in the United States alone 

2. Louisiana Territory had just been purchased, giving the flatboatmen an open 
way to New Orleans. 

3. French law and customs prevailed at New Orleans and were protected by the 
treaty of cession. 



 

that laws have been passed, not only for their safety and 
protection from every species of injury, but considerable 
sums of money have been appropriated, and agents employed, 
to humanize their ininds, and instruct them in such of the 
arts of civilized life as they are capable of receiving. To pro- 
vide a substitute for the chase, from which they derive their 
support, and which from the extension of our settlements is 
becoming daily more precarious, has been considered a sacred 
duty. 

The humane and benevolent intentions of the government, 
however, will be forever defeated unless effectual measures 
be devised to prevent the sale of ardent spirits to those un- 
happy people. The law which has been passed by Congress 
for that purpose has been found entirely ineffectual, because 
its operation has been construed to extend to the Indian coun- 
try exclusively.* In calling your attention to this subject, 
gentlemen, I am persuaded that it is unnecessary to remind 
you that the article of compact makes [it] your duty to at- 
tend to it. The interests of your constituents, the interests 
of the miserable Indians, and your own feelings will suffi- 
ciently urge you to take it into your most serious considera- 
tion, and provide the remedy which is to save thousands of 
our fellow creatures. You are witnesses to the abuses, you 
have seen our towns crowded with furious and drunken sav- 
ages, our streets flowing with their blood, their arms and 
clothing bartered for the liquor that destroys them, and their 
miserable women and children enduring all the extremities 
of cold and hunger. So destructive has the progress of in- 
temperance been among them, that whole villages have been 
swept away. A miserable remnant is all that remains to 
mark the names and situation of many numerous and war- 
like tribes. In the energetic language of one of their orators, 
it is a dreadful conflagration, which spreads misery and deso- 
lation through their country and threatens the annihilation 
of the whole race. Is it then to be admitted, as a political 
axiom, that the neighborhood of a civilized nation is incom- 
patible with the existence of savages? Are the blessings of 
our republican government only to be felt by ourselves? And 
are the natives of North America to experience the same fate 
with their brethren of the southern continent? It is with

you, gentlemen, to divert from those children of nature the 
ruin which hangs over them. Nor can I believe that the 
time will be considered as misspent, which is devoted to an 
object so consistent with the spirit of Christianity, and with 
the principles of republicanism.' 

In the examination of our statute laws, which you will 
naturally make, it will no doubt be found that there is much 

5. My stay at Fort Vincents save me an opportunity of oliservini: tlie savages; 
whom I found assembled to sell the produce of their red hunt. There were reckoned 
to be four or five hundred men, women, and children, of various nations or tribes, 
as the Weeaws, Payouries, Saukies, Pyankishaws, Miamis, &c.. all living toward the 
head of the Wabash. It was the first time of my observin;-j: at leisure these people, 
already become rare on the east of the .\llefihanies. Their appearance was to me a 
new and whimsical siffht. Conceive bodies almost naked, embrowned by exposure to 
the Sun and air. shining with srease and soot ; a head uncovered ; hair coarse, black, 
sleek, straight, and smooth ; a face disguised with black, blue, and red paint, in round, 
square, and rhomboidal patches : one nostril bored to admit a large ring of silver or 
copper : earrings with three rows of drops reaching down to the shoulders, and passing 
through holes that would admit a finger ; a little square apron before, and another 
behind, both fastened by one string or riband ; the legs and thighs sometimes naked, 
at others covered with long cloth spatterdashes : socks of leather dried in the smoke : 
on some occasions a shirt with short, wide sleeves, variegated or striped with blue and 
white, and flowing loose down the thighs ; and over this a blanket, or a square piece 
of cloth, thrown over one shoulder, and tied under the opposite arm, or under the chin. 
On particular occasions, when they dress for war or for a feast, the hair is braided 
and interwoven with feathers, plants, fiowers, and even bones ; the warriors wear 
round their wrists broad rings of copper or silver, resembling our dogs collars, and 
round the head a diadem foi-med of silver buckles and trinkets of glass : in their hand 
they have their pipe, or their knife, or their tomahawk, and the little looking-glass, 
which every savage uses with more coquetry, to admire so many charms, than the 
most coquettish belle of Paris. The women, who are a little more covered about the 
hips, differ from the men likewise in cari-ying almost continually one or two children 
on their back in a kind of bag, the ends of which are tied on their forehead. Who- 
ever has seen gypsies may form a vei-y good idea of this luggage. 

Such is the outline of the picture, and I exhibit it in the most favourable point of 
view. For if I were to display the whole, I must add, that from early in the morning 
both men and women roam about the streets, for no other purpose but to procure them- 
selves rum ; and for this they first dispose of the produce of their chase, then of their 
toys, next of their clothes, and last they go begging for it, never ceasing to drink, till 
they are absolutely senseless. Sometimes this gives occasion to ridiculous scenes ; they 
will hold the cup to drink with both hands like apes, then raise up their heads with 
bursts of laUKhter. and gargle themselves with their beloved but fatal liquor, to enjoy 
the pleasure of tasting it the longer ; hand the cup from one to another with noisly in- 
vitations : call to one only three steps off as loud as they can bawl : take hold of their 
wives by the head and poui- the rum down their throats with coarse caresses, and all the 
ridiculous gestures of our vulgar alehouse sots. Sometimes distressing scenes ensue, 
as the loss of all sense and reason, becoming mad or stupid, or falling down dead di-unk 
in the dust or mud, there to sleep till the next day. I could not go out in a morning 
without finding them by dozens in the streets or paths about the village, literally wallow- 
ing in the dirt with the pigs. It was a very fortunate circumstance if a day passed 
without a quarrel, or a battle with knives or tomahawks, by which ten men on an 
average lose their lives yeaily. On the 9th of august, at four o'clock in the afternoon, 
a savage stabbed his wife in four places with a knife within twenty steps of me. 
A fortnight before a similar circumstance took place, and five such the year pre- 
ceding. For this vengeance is immediately taken, or dissembled till a proper oppor- 
tunity offers, by the relations, which produces fresh causes for waylaying and assassina- 
tion. Volney, View of the United States 393 seq. (Aug. 2, 1796) 



 

room for alteration and improvement. I presume, however, 
that the circumstances of the Territory are not such as to 
authorize an entire change in the system which is in opera- 
tion. The formation of a new code would be attended with 
an expense which our citizens are at present ill able to sup- 
ply ; and the advantages which would result from it would be 
probably, more than counterbalanced by the many embarrass- 
ments which it might occasion. Some alterations are, never- 
theless, necessary, and none more than in the organization of 
the inferior courts of judicature. As the judges of those 
courts derive little or no emolument from their commissions, 
in order to secure the attendance of a sufficient number for 
the business I have been obliged to multiply them to an ex- 
tent which precludes all hope of a uniformity of decision. It 
is, indeed, not unfrequent that the judges who determine the 
question are not those who have presided at its discussion. 
Limited as our means certainly are, and cautious as we must 
be of drawing from the people a single cent that can be dis- 
pensed with, it is indispensably necessary that an evil should 
be corrected which strikes at the root of one of the first ob- 
jects of civil society.** 

The militia law is much too complicated for the state of 
our society and population. A system which would unite sim- 
plicity with energy would be highly desirable, and would leave 
us nothing to apprehend from a rupture with our Indian 
neighbors. The importance of this subject is so manifest that 
it cannot be necessary for me to press it upon your attention." 

Excepting in a single instance — horse stealing, to which 
there is not an adequate punishment affixed — our penal laws 
are as perfect as our situation will admit. A considerable 
accession of population and riches must accrue to us before 
we can be enabled to change the present sanguinaiy system 
for one equally preventive of crime, and which, by a just 
and humane discrimination, apportions the punishment to the 
offence." 

From the construction which I have put upon the ordinance 
of Congress, the erection of new counties will rest with the

History of the United States. 



 

legislature. It is a power, however, which ought to be cau- 
tiously used, as the advantages produced by it are often illu- 
sive or partial, whilst the expense is certain and general. 

In the apportionment of representatives among the sev- 
eral counties, I have aimed at an impartial distribution; but 
as the documents from which my estimation is made are ex- 
tremely defective, it is more than probable that some injus- 
tice may have taken place. 

Before another election be held, it is expedient that some 
plan should be adopted for ascertaining the number of free 
made inhabitants of the respective counties. It is believed 
that the militia returns, under proper regulations, might be 
made sufficiently accurate for the purpose, and this mode is 
also recommended by its superior cheapness. 

But the most difficult and delicate of your duties, gentle- 
men, will be to create a revenue which shall be adequate to 
the expenses of the government, without imposing too great 
a burthen upon your constituents; and to appropriate with 
the strictest frugality and economy the sums which must be 
chiefly drawn from industry and improvement. Few indeed 
are the objects of taxation in a newly settled country. In 
the commencement of our financial operations, some trifling 
embarrassments must be expected ; however, I trust they will 
be of momentary continuance. The progress of our popula- 
tion, in spite of those difficulties which have impeded it, leaves 
no room to doubt that, when those impediments are removed, 
the settlement and improvement of our country will corre- 
spond with its fertility and its advantageous situation. A 
few months have already produced the most favorable change 
in the aspect of our affairs. Our possessions, circumscribed 
on all sides by the Indian territory, have been enlarged to 
the extent of an empire ; and the most fertile and contiguous 
parts opened for sale and settlement upon terms which must 
give hopes of becoming a freeholder to the most indigent of 
our citizens. The wisdom and liberality of our government 
have been equally manifested in the disposition of their valu- 
able salt springs on the Saline creek [in southern Illinois] ; 
as in the lease which has been granted, every idea of pecuni- 
ary advantage has been abandoned, and the reduction of the 
price of salt alone considered. It is with great satisfaction 
that I inform you, gentlemen, that the object of the govern- 
ment has been fully obtained, and that this indispensable 



 

article of domestic economy will never again be subject to 
the disgraceful and destroying monopoly which has hitherto 
prevailed. 

The treasurer will lay before you an account of all the re- 
ceipts and expenditures, from the commencement of the gov- 
ernment. If a considerable deficit is found, it will be also 
found that not a sixpence has been appropriated which had 
not for its object some public and important purpose. Al- 
though our situation precludes us from a vote in the councils 
of the Union, and from many other advantages which are 
enjoyed by our fellow citizens, we must, nevertheless, rejoice 
in the unexampled prosperity of our common country, and 
the elevated rank which she has attained among the nations 
of the earth. It is not, however, by that rank which we may 
hold in the scale of wealth and power that the American citi- 
zen is so pre-eminently distinguished. The enjoyment of civil 
and religious liberty is exclusively his own. In vain shall we 
search through the world for another government whose only 
object is the happiness of the governed, whose only support is 
the affections of the people. 

By a compact which is coeval with the establishment of 
government northwest of the Ohio [Ordinance of 1787], the 
right of being admitted, as soon as our population will justify, 
into the great family which composes the American Union, is 
firnily secured to us. Let us unite our exertions, fellow citi- 
zens, to hasten a consummation which is to restore to us all 
our political rights, and to place us in the elevated station of 
a free, sovereign, and independent State, equal to our sister 
States in dignity and rights. If wisdom and unanimity should 
preside in our councils, a very few years will accomplish this 
important object. But if, on the contrary, dissension and 
discord should spring up among us — if local prejudices and 
local politics should prevail, and banish from among us those 
liberal and expanded sentiments which can forego a partial 
advantage for the benefit of a community — then are we un- 
worthy of the dignified station that awaits us, and the pres- 
ent colonial government is the best calculated for our hap- 
piness. I am, however, well persuaded, gentlemen, that your 
deliberations will produce a different result, and that the 
candor and liberality which marked your conduct in private 
life, and which pointed you out to the notice of your fellow 
citizens, will be equally rnanifested within these walls. You 



 

may with confidence rely upon my co-operation in every 
measure which is calculated to promote the interests of the 
territory; and I fervently supplicate the Supi-eme Ruler of 
the world to crown your labors with honor to yourselves and 
advantage to your constituents. 

House of Representatives to the Governor 

July 30, 1805 
Dawson, Han-ison, 77 

To the Governor of the Indiana Territory : 

Accept, sir, the thanks of the house of representatives for 
the speech you made to both houses of the legislature on the 
opening of the present session. In it we discern the solicitude 
for the future happiness and prosperity of the territory which 
has been uniformly evinced by your past administration. 

We feel a pleasure, correspondent with that which you 
express, for the happy change that has taken place in our 
form of government. The system is still very imperfect; 
but we believe many solid and essential advantages will re- 
sult to the territory from the respresentative grade. 

We consider the acquisition of Louisiana highly important, 
not only to the interest of the western people, but to the 
United States in general. While it has greatly enlarged our 
boundary, it has secured to us the peace and friendship of 
the neighboring Indian tribes, and removed a danger justly 
to be apprehended, from its being possessed by a powerful 
and ambitious European nation. 

We hope neither party animosity nor local prejudice will 
influence our proceedings. Although our settlements are 
widely dispersed, our respective interests are the same, and 
we know no cause that ought to excite disunion among us. 

To prevent the sale of ardent spirits among the Indians; 
to form a more perfect system of courts of judicature; to 
improve the militia system ; to revise and correct, in part the 
criminal laws; and to devise ways and means for raising a 
revenue, adequate to the exigencies of the territory, without 
oppressing our fellow citizens, are objects of the utmost im- 
portance. These, with the other subjects recommended to 
our consideration, will receive all the attention to which they 
are entitled respectively; and from your uniform zeal in 



 

whatever relates to the interests of the territory, we have no 
doubt of your cordial co-operation. 

We look forward with peculiar satisfaction to the period 
when our population will enable us to assume the dignity of 
a state government for the extinguishment of Indian claims, 
and foi- the settlement of the territory, we have the fairest 
prospects of a speedy and immense increase in our popula- 
tion; and we will readily concur in any measure that will 
have a tendency to promote our political emancipation. 



Legislative Council to the Governor 

July 30, 1805 
Dawson, Harrison, 76 

Sir— 

The Legislative council have received the speech by you 
delivered to both houses of the legislature. They agree with 
you in opinion that the government of the territory has as- 
sumed a milder form, and that our grateful acknowledgments 
are due to the Almighty Ruler of the universe for the bless- 
ings which we now enjoy. 

Although we are not as completely independent in our legis- 
lative capacity as we would wish to be, yet we are sensible 
that we must wait with patience for that period of time when 
our population will burst the trammels of a territorial gov- 
ernment, and we shall assume a character more consonant 
to republicanism, and which alone will secure to the inhabi- 
tants of the territory a full participation of the rights now 
enjoyed by the citizens of the United States. That period 
we hope is not far distant; and we have every reason to be- 
lieve, from past experience, that your exertions will not be 
wanting for the attainment of the so much desired object. 

The confidence which our fellow citizens have uniformly 
had in your administration, has been such that they have 
hitherto had no reason to be jealous of the unlimited power 
which you possess over our legislative proceedings. We how- 
ever, cannot help regretting that such powers have been 
lodged in the hands of any one; especially when it is recol- 
lected to what dangerous lengths the exercise of those powers 
may be extended. 

The several subjects which you have particularly recom- 



 

mended, will engage our peculiar consideration; and we beg 
you to be assured that we shall concur with you in every 
measure that may tend to the welfare and happiness of the 
territory.

Sir: 

I am now surrounded by the Chiefs of the Delaware, Miami 
and Eel River Tribes. A part of the Patawatimies have also 
arrived and others are every moment expected. 

The Delawares have explicitly acknowledged the Treaty 
they made here the last year in the presence of a number 
of respectable characters whom I assembled for the purpose 
and will do so in the General Council that will take place upon 
the arrival of the Patawatimies.^ 

Capt. Wells and the Turtle are both here and I have re- 
ceived from each a positive assurance of a friendly disposi- 
tion as well towards the Government as myself and inci- 
dentally — With Captn. Wells I have had an explanation and 
have agreed to a general amnesty and act of oblivion for 
the past. I hope that this treaty will be ratified by you. I 
am convinced that both him and the Turtle will exert them- 
selves to bring the present conference to a happy issue. 

I have the Honor to be with highest respect 
Your humble servt.

Sir: 

The distance between us is so great, and the communication 
so irregular, as to render it impossible to recur to you for 

1. This council was called by the governor largely to talk over with the chiefs the 
general situation and attitude of the Indians. By private conversation and a judicious 
use of "presents" it seems all were placated and the governor succeeded in purchasing 
all the lands of the Kaskaskias (Aug. 13) as well as getting quit claims from all in- 
terested tribes for all previous cessions.

advice and instructions, in many cases of importance, where 
I feel myself much at a loss to know how to act without them. 
Thus it has been in the late conference with the Indians, 
which resulted in the treaty that I have now the honor to 
enclose. 

The first object that engaged my attention, at the opening 
of the council, was, to satisfy the Indians of our right to 
make the treaty with the Delawares, that has been so much 
complained of; and I found little difficulty to getting them to 
recognize every part of that treaty, excepting the article 
which guaranties to the Delawares the country between the 
White river and the Ohio. As the information upon which 
that article was founded was derived from the Delawares 
themselves, a good opportunity was offered to ascertain the 
truth of the cession said to have been made by the Miamies 
at Fort WajTie, in the year 1803. The latter strenuously con- 
tended, that the declaration which they made, on that occa- 
sion, meant nothing more than an assurance to the Delawares, 
that they should occupy the country as long as they pleased, 
but that they had no intention to convey an exclusive right. 
During the whole contest between these tribes, which lasted 
several days, I observed the mo.?t exact neutrality. I made 
the Delawares perfectly comprehend, that the guarantee of 
the United States depended upon their being able to make 
the Miamies acknowledge the cession of Fort Wayne. This 
aclcnowledgment, however, the Miamies would not make, and 
the Delawares finally gave up the contest, although it was evi- 
dent to me, that the declaration made the Owl, on behalf of 
the Miamies, at Fort Wayne, was fully as strong as the Dela- 
ware chiefs had reported it to be. At the commencement of 
the council, the Miami and Pattawatamy chiefs had hinted 
at the necessity of increasing their annuities, so as to put 
them on a footing with the Delawares. But I soon put an 
end to their hopes, by assuring thSm, in the most positive 
terms, that, as the United States had made a fair bargain 
with the Delawares and Piankeshaws, who were the owners 
of the land that had been ceded, not a six pence would be 
given to any other tribe, in consideration of that purchase;' 

1. This refers to the famous Grouseland purchase. Aug. 21, 1805. It comprised 
the lands south of White river, west of Clarli's Grant and north of the Ohio, remaining 
an Indian possession. The Delawares. Pottawattomies, Miamis and Weas signed by their 
20 chiefs. There were 15 white signers, besides Harrison, including the whole official 
family. Grouseland was the home of Harrison. 



 

but, that they might obtain a further annuity, by a further 
cession of land; and this brought on the negotiation for the 
tract ceded by the enclosed treaty. The consideration is 
greater than I could have wished, but it was not possible to 
reduce it one single cent; indeed, they insisted, for several 
days, on having their former annuity doubled for a much 
smaller tract than that which was finally given up. A knowl- 
edge of the value of land is fast gaining ground amongst the 
Indians, and, in the course of the negotiation, one of the chiefs 
observed, that he knew that a great part of the land was 
worth six dollars per acre. The admission of the Pattawata- 
mies, as a party to the treaty, could not well be avoided, 
under the circumstances which gave rise to the conference, 
and I am confident that it will, eventually, be highly advan- 
tageous to us. They have given up all right to interfere in 
any future sales of lands by the Miamies, on the Wabash and 
its waters. The guarantee of those lands to the three tribes, 
who call themselves Miamies, could not be avoided, as they 
insisted upon it with the most persevering obstinacy. But, 
I conceive that it v/ill be no difficult matter to get them, in 
the course of a few years, to make a division of the land 
that they now hold in common. At any rate, a point of much 
consequence has been gained, by getting the other tribes to 
acknowledge their exclusive title to the country of the Wabash, 
above the Vincennes tract. The Miami chiefs were extremely 
desirous to have the Piankeshaws included in the treaty, but 
this I would on no account suffer, reserving to the United 
States the right of purchasing the remaining Piankeshaws' 
lands, at any time that they could agree for them with that 
tribe. This aftair is now in a prosperous train, and can be 
completed, on the most advantageous terms, whenever the 
President shall think proper to direct it. I think, upon the 
whole, that it would be as well to postpone the purchase a 
short time, perhaps until next spring; but, if it should be 
determined otherwise, I can venture to promise that all the 
lands which lie between the Wabash and the lands ceded by 
the Kaskaskias treaty, and below a continuation of the line 
running through Point Coupee, will be the property of the 
United States in ten days after I shall receive your instruc- 
tions for that purpose, and for a consideration, too, which 
will compensate for any excess in that given by the present 
treaty. From the best calculation that I have been able to 



 

make, the tract which has now been ceded contains at least 
two millions of acres, and embraces some of the finest land 
in the Western country. I shall do myself the honor to write 
to you by the next mail, and give a particular account of the 
bills I have drawn for the purposes of the treaty. 

In pursuance of the President's directions, I have promised 
the [Little] Turtle fifty dollars, per annum, in addition to 
his pension ; and I have, also, directed Captain Wells to pur- 
chase a negro man for him, in Kentucky, and draw on you 
for the amount. 

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, your humble 
servant

(Enclosures: Liquor Law and Invoice of Indian Goods) 

Vincennes 16th Sept. 1805 

Har. Pa. 159-1(16 

Sir: 

After the conditions of the late treaty had been agreed 
upon finding that the Delawares were not well pleased with 
the conduct of the Miamis I made an attempt to induce the 
latter to give up to the U. S. a tract of about 400,000 acres 
adjoining to and west of the line running from the mouth 
of the Kentucky River to Fort Recovery and above the line 
which is to run from the Vincennes trace to the last men- 
tioned line upon condition that the United States should 
change the annuity which the Delawares are to receive for 
ten years into a permanent one. This proposition gave much 
pleasure to the Delawares and was agreed to by the other 
Tribes but when the Treaty was prepared for signing one of 
the principal chiefs refused to sign until that article was ex- 



 

punged and prevailed upon a majority of the others to accept 
his opinion. The Delawares indignant at the Treatment de- 
clared an intention of removing altogether from the neigh- 
bourhood of the Miamis and joining the part of their tribe 
that reside on the w^est bank of the Mississippi. They would 
not agree that any part of the money which by the Treaty 
of August 1804 was to be appropriated to the purpose of 
ameliorating their condition should be paid out in improve- 
ments where they now reside. I was therefore obliged to 
give them the two sums of $300 for their five and ten years 
annuity which was to have been laid out in horses cattle &c. 
in cash and have drawn on you three several drafts for those 
sums one of $300 in favour of Mr. Wallace and the other two 
in favor of Mr. Bullit. Inclosed herewith is the receipt of 
the Delawares for the aggregate amount of $1000. 

The four thousand dollars given by the late Treaty was 
divided in the following manner. To the Delawares $1000, 
to the Miamis $1000 the Pattawatomies $1000 and to the 
Eel River and Wea Tribes $500 each. The Delawares Miamis 
and Eel River Tribes received the whole of their proportion 
and the Potawatimies $700 of theirs from the factory at 
Fort Wayne and I have drawn on you in favor of Mr. [John] 
Johnston for the aggregate amount of $3200. The $500 for 
the Weas and the ballance of the $300 for the Patawatomies 
were paid here and the drafts given for the former to Mr. 
[William] Bullit^ and for the latter to Mr. [Touissant] Du- 
bois.= I have also drawn two other bills in favor of Mr. Bul- 
lit one for $600 and one for $150 to cover the contingent ex- 
penses of the Treaty which have been greater than usual for 
two reasons, first, from the necessity there was (to prevent 
jealousy) for treating many of the other chiefs with the 
same indulgence that the Turtle and Richardville had long 
enjoyed, and second from my being obliged to trust entirely 
to Mr. Wells and [Joseph] Barron^ on account of indisposi- 

1. William Bullit was a land speculator from Louisville who operated in several 
sections of southern Indiana especially in Terre Haute. See his commission Sept. 24 

2. Touissant Dubois was of an old French family. He was engaged extensively in 
mercantile business at Vincennes, Kaskaskia and Cahokia. He did a large Indian trade 
and was especially useful to Harrison. 

For an excellent history of this famous pioneer see Wilson, Dubois County History.

capable and trusted interpreter and scout. He was present at and attached his name

warded. 

I shall set out on the 25th Instant for St. Louis accom- 
panied by the chiefs who compose the Deputation appointed 
to meet the Osages. 

I have the honor to inclose herewith the copies of two laws 
that were passed by the Legislature of the territories at their 
late session. I exerted myself to procure the passage of a 
law confining the Indian trade entirely to their own country, 
but the Legislature were unwilling to go so far. I am per- 
suaded that a letter from you to the Executives of the neigh- 
boring States and Territories would greatly expedite the pas- 
sage of a law forbidding the sale of ardent spirits to the In- 
dians. The reason assigned by the legislature for passing the 
law with the condition of its not taking efi'ect until a similar 
one was passed by our neighbours, was that it would be of 
little beneift to the Indians to prohibit their getting liquor 
here if they could obtain it by going into a neighbouring state 
or Territory and by returning with it into this Territory. 
The citizens would suffer all the inconveniences of their 
drunkenness without the advantage of their trade. 

I have the honor to be with great respect and consideration, 
Sir your humble servt.

Reposing special trust and confidence in your patriotism 
courage and good conduct I have appointed you Captain in 
the Battallion of the Regiment of the Militia of the county of 
Knox and you are hereby appointed accordingly. You are 
therefore carefully and diligently to discharge the duty of 



 

a Captain in leading ordering and exercising said company 
in arms, both inferior officers and soldiers, and to keep them 
in good order and discipline ; and they are hereby commanded 
to obey you as their Captain, and you are yourself to observe 
and follow such orders and instructions as you shall from 
time to time receive from me, your superior officers or the 
Governor of the territory for the time being. 

In testimony whereof, I have caused the seal of the Ter- 
ritory to be affixed the twenty-fourth day of September in 
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five 
and of the independence of the United States of America 
the thirtieth.

War Department, October 11, 1805 

Dawson, Harrison, SO 

Sir — Your letter, accompanying the treaty with the Miamis, 
etc. has been duly received. Its contents are highly satis- 
factory and pleasing. The amicable adjustment of all diffi- 
culties and uneasiness in relation, made by the Delawares 
and Piankishaws, is a desirable event, especially when con- 
nected with the subsequent cession, which gives us the whole 
margin of the Ohio above the mouth of the Wabash, and 
connects the state of Ohio with the Indiana territory for 50 
miles in extent, free from Indian claims. 

I am directed by the President of the United States, to 
request you to close a bargain, as soon as it can be effected, 
with the Piankishaws, for their claim to the lands between 
the Wabash and the eastern boundary of the Kaskaskia ces- 
sion, as proposed in your letter of August 26th, on such rea- 
sonable terms as have been usual in that quarter; and for 
any sums which may be necessary for the prompt payment, 
you will please draw on this department. I hope we shall 
soon hear of a favorable result from St. Louis. 

Your explanation with [Wells], resulting in a confident 
hope of future good conduct on his part, and mutual har- 



 

mony hereafter, is not uninteresting. That he had been play- 
ing a foolish and what he thought a cunning game, I have 
no doubt. 

With sentiments of the highest esteem, I am 

Your excellency's obedient servant

Sir: 

I beg bearer to repeat to you by Capn. [Amos] Stoddard' 
what I have before communicated that his whole conduct 
whilst acting as Civil Commandant of Upper Louisiana was 
as far as I can judge extremely proper and upright and such 
as in my opinion greatly contributed to destroy the preju- 
dices which existed in this country prior to the cession against 
our country and countrymen. 

I have the Honor to be with perfect respect Sir 
your Humble servant

ers to Organize a Government in the District of Louisiana, 
to establish courts of Justice therein, to make and PubUsh a 
code of laws for its government, and to hold two courts An- 
nually in the said District. 

To meet those weighty duties, not less important in their 
nature than unexpected to your petitioners, they convened in 
the month of Sepr. 1804 in their Legislative capacity, and 
Entered upon the arduous task pointed out by the law — after 
a lengthy and laborious Session, under many difficulties, they 
were enabled to complete a code of laws for the District, 
which were in due time promulgated by the Executive of this 
Territory. 

That in order to discharge the Several duties enjoined on 
your Petitioners, they have been obliged, at a considerable 
expence to Travel from hence to Louisiana a distance of more 
than Two hundred miles through a Wilderness exposed to 
all the difficulties and hardships attendant on such Journies. 
The courts of Justice have been regularly holden in the Dis- 
trict, the Session of the General court in May last continued 
two weeks. 

That all the duties assigned to your Petitioners by the 
aforesaid law have been fully and faithfully performed, for 
which no compensation has been provided. Your Petitioners 
therefore riiost earnestly pray that your Honorable body 
would take their case into your Serious consideration and 
grant such compensation to your Petitioners respectively, for 
the services by them rendered in conformity to the said Act, 
as in your wisdom and Justice shall seem right — and your 
Petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray.'

The Honble The Speaker of the House of Representatives of 

the United States 
[Indorsed] 

19th December 1805. referred to the Committee appointed yesterday, 
on a letter from Govr. Harrison, and the report of a select Committee 
thereon, of 17th February 1804. 

14th February 1806. [Adverse] Report made, and referred to a com- 
mittee of the whole House, on Tuesday next. 



 

In the House of Representatives of the Indiana 
Territory 

February 7th 1805 

This House has learned with hvely regret that certain dis- 
contented factious men are endeavouring to effect a division of 
this Territory and to attach the Western Counties, on the 
Mississippi, to upper Louisiana. It is understood they are, 
and have been petitioning the Congress of the United States 
to this purpose ; that very improper means have been employed 
to obtain signatures to their memorials ; and that to augment 
their numbers, small boys and the most worthless characters 
in the Country are permitted to subscribe to them. The rea- 
sons assigned for this measure are, the essential difference in 
the interests of the Western counties from the other parts of 
the Territory, and the distance of the Mississippi Country 
from, and the obstacles that exist in the communication with 
the seat of Government Vincennes, which, 'tis said, operate 
a serious injury to the inhabitants. It is true that the Settle- 
ments of the Territory are widely dispersed and five of them 
are unconnected with each other; but viewing them as they 
are situated from the Great Miami to the Mississippi, we can- 
not perceive that, with the exception of Detroit, there is any 
material difference in their respective interests, or most cer- 
tainly not so much so as to render a separation, in the least, 
necessary. And it is not believed that any peculiar advantage 
is derived to any particular part of the Territory from its 
proximity to the seat of Government. If these reasons are 
Just, distinct Governments ought to be found for each distinct 
settlement; for they are all, except Detroit, nearly equidistant 
from each other. But the difficulties that now exist in the 
communication between the respective settlements will shortly 
be entirely removed. The Indian Titles to all the lands from 
Vincennes to the Ohio above the Great Falls, and down to the 
junction of the Wabash River with the Ohio and some distance 
West of the Wabash, and the Kaskaskia claim which compre- 
hended a large portion of the tract of Country which lies be- 
tween the Mississippi, Ohio, Wabash and Illinois Rivers have 
lately been purchased by the United States ; and the Measures 
that have been taken for the disposal of these lands will open 
the whole Country for settlement. The situation of the Terri- 
tory, its climate productions and fertility of soil, afford the 



 

most flattering prospects of an immence influx of Emigrants, 
and that at no distant period all the settlements from the 
Great Falls of Ohio to the Mississippi will be connected with 
each other. But further — The people of the Territory have 
lately assumed the second or representative grade of Govern- 
ment. This measure will involve considerable expence and 
from the smallness of population will probably be a very seri- 
ous burden ; but if a division of the Territory takes place the 
evil will be very greatly augmented. 

Therefore Resolved That detaching the Counties on the 
Mississippi from the Government of Indiana is inexpedient 
and derogatory to the Interests of the Territory, and that the 
speaker of this House do sign and request the Governor of 
this Territory to forward the above to the Congress of the 
United States.

Jefferson Papers, 2d series, vol. 42, no. 83 

Dear Sir 

Mr [John] Hay' having declined the appointment of a mem- 
ber of the Legislative Council for this Territory two other 
persons have been nominated agreeably to the Ordinance and 
I presume their names have been sent on to you. — viz Mr 
Bond- & Mr John Perry^ — the former is certainly the 

1. Henry Hurst born in Jefferson Co. Va. 1769 came to Ky. while young; lawyer 
and clerk at Vincennes enlisted and served on Harrison's staff in 1811; removed to 
JefEersonville IS13 ; later clerk in U. S. court at Indianapolis: in Indiana legislature 
1838-9 ; rode beside Harrison at Tippecanoe and 40 years later rode by his side in 
Washington at his inauguration. Died at Jeffersonville about 1854. 

Esarey. Courts and Lawyers, Xli5 

1. John Hay was born in Detroit May 7. 1769, son of a Pennsylvanian, governor 
of Upper Canada, a U. E. Loyalist ; highly educated, spoke French as his native tongue ; 
engaged in fur trade : settled in Cahokia 1797 and was its leading citizen for many 
years. He died in Belleville, 1843. He was highly respected and trusted by St. Clair 
and Harrison ; Reynolds, Pioneer Illinois, 225 

2. Shadrach Bond Sr. was a native of Maryland ; served under Clark ; crossed the 
mountains with a small band of hunters in 1781 and settled with his family near 
Kaskaskia — block house fort. Sat in legislature at Cincinnati 1799; justice in his com- 



 

most proper character; — altho' he has had Httle ad- 
vantage from education he posses [ses] a very strong nat- 
ural capacity & his character for honesty has never been im- 
peached. He is withall a staunch repubHcan & much more 
popular than any other man in his County — I believe it was 
the wish of the members of the House of Representatives as I 
know it is of his present Constituents that he should be in the 
Council — Mr Perry is a French man — I know nothing against 
his character excepting that he has been pretty deeply en- 
gaged in purchasing the land claims in the Illinois Country — 
Both these gentlemen were unfortunately opposed to our going 
into the second grade of Government — Mr Bonds opposition 
was very extraordinary & unexpected — the greatest efforts 
were however made by the land Jobbers to gain him over to 
their interest — & those gentry (some of whom own upwards 
of 100,000 acres of land) frightened at the Idea of having a 
land tax did not hesitate to spread any falsehood that was 
likely to defeat the Measure. 

I Have the Honor to be with the most perfect Respect & 
Esteem Dr Sir your Hume Servt.

Sir: 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favours 
of the 2nd September and the 11th October. In the former 
you observe that the sum of seventy eight dollars paid to 
Abraham Brinker for a horse stolen by the Delawares was to 
be taken from the Delaware annuity for 1806. But the Treaty 
made with that Tribe in 1804 obliges the United States to pay 
for those horses. I have sent for the Piankeshaw chiefs to 
negociate for the tract of land between the Wabash and the 
Kaskaskias purchase — two or three of them are near me but 

munity for years and took an honorable part in politics. He was a friend of St. 
Clair and Harrison, though like all his class took orders from no one. Bond was 
selected by the president. Reynolds, Pioneer Illinois^ index 

3. Jean Francis Perry was an emigre noble from Lyons, France ; came to America 
in 1792 ; brought goods west and went into business at Prairie du Pont, III. ; purchasing 
the old St. .Sulpice mill and estate. He was educated as a lawyer but made a fortune 
in business, principally in land speculation. He died in 1812.

one of them whose presence I think necessary is on the 
Mississippi and it will take some time to get him here. It 
appears to me to be incumbent upon the United States to pass 
a law to protect the Kaskaskias Tribe from the impositions 
which are constantly practiced upon them by white people. 
Designing persons are in the habit of getting them in debt 
and then threatening them with a suit unless they prevail 
upon me to assume payment. I have in several instances been 
obliged to become responsible for Ducoign to save him from a 
suit when I was by no means certain of the justice of the de- 
mand. I have this day drawn upon you in favor of Geo. 
Wallace Junior & Co. [merchants of Vincennes, son-in-law of 
General Gibson] for $298.31 a part of this account is for arti- 
cles furnished the Deputies from the Wea, Patowatimi and 
Delaware Tribes who went with me to St. Louis. I have en- 
closed their several accounts that the amount of them may be 
deducted from the annuity of their Tribes should you think it 
proper.

Sir: 

We went according to your request and delivered your mes- 
sage to the Kickapoo chiefs as named in the following speech ; 
[Dec. 16, 1805] we found them on the frontiers very quiet and 
in appearance very amicably disposed and in fact, the Amer- 
ican settlements that are near them speak much in their 
favour. The Chief Pawatamo, kept to himself during the 
Counsel, the relation of some insult, that he and his family 
had received from the Americans, not wishing to show (as 
he told us afterwards) any animosity or even any thought of 
hostility in their speech. This as he himself afterwards re- 
lated to us, is the insults; that the Americans stole two Bells 
from off his horses' necks, whilst he was at the Mamelles^ ;

that whilst his son was a hunting, an American threatened to 
kill him and that his son was obliged to escape by flight and 
that as customary, as they were gathering Pipyminnt [Per- 
simmons] about Goshen [Madison County, 111.] which they 
generally do by cutting down the Trees, the Americans drove 
them away by force.

I don't doubt but you will think it strange that you have not 
heard from me before this time but when you have my rea-

letter with your mesage to the indiens I was so ill that I was 
not able to travel ten miles. I sent the papers to Mr. Perry 
and made a request to Mr. [William] Biggs^ to go to the 
Indians But he could not go therefore it was not done until I 
found myself better and on Tuesday the third of this instant 
I went to Cahokia and waited for Perry and the interpreter 
until Thursday wen myself Perry and a Frenchman by the 
name of mime [?] who is the best interpreter in this county 
started and went through the back settlements to ascertain 
the facts about the burning wich detained us the most of that 
day. We arrived on Friday about Nine o'clock at Mr. Ogles= 
about twelve miles from the Indians and Mr. Perry was taken

so ill that he could travel no furder that day. But we sent 
our interpreter to find thare camps and know where the chiefs 
was and to let them know that we was coming with a message 
from their father and to request them to collect as many as 
posable. He returned on Saturday about ten o'clock and we 
started. But did not arive at thare camps until late in the 
after noon on Sunday morning the three hed chiefs and some 
other chiefs with about thirty men in the whole assembled. 
We delivered your message and received thare answare wich 
Perry took home with him and was to have sent it to me with 
his Remarks in A day or two But I have Not yet received it 
But in two or three days I shall go for it and send it on to 
you. [Dec 16, 1805] We found the indians very frendly 
and seems to wish for peace to continue Betwen them and the 
whits and furder the settlers that live nerrest to thare camps 
say they have Never seen them so friendly in thare lives and 
that thay have done them No harm except that of Burning 
and the Indians Reasons for that you will see in thare answar 
to your measage We spoke to them considerable on the ad- 
vantage of peace as we live so Neare to gether and that we 
ought to do eatch other all the good we could and as little 
harm as posible and they seemed to desire it as much as we 
we give them forty three pounds of tobaco and about half 
a bushel of sault and parted I got home on munday the Ninth 
we was out from Cahokia five days I think the interpreter 
ought to have three dollars per day as he got five dollars in 
Peltry to go out and traid with the Indiens and we could 
Not get him for les I have no news we are all well and I hope 
that you and yours is the same and dear Sir I remaine with

Speech Pronounced by the Latter 

[Dec 16, 1805] 

Har. Pa. 179 

He that made us, made us and made fire, it is the master 
of life we are accused of having set fire — we did it and we also 
saw white people do it. The Deer was put on the Earth by 



 

the Master of Life, and we endeavour to make our wives and 
children live, and if we are not permitted to set fire we cannot 
live. You then want us to die. You the whites would be 
very angry if we were to die with hunger, for the want of 
hunting, and that we should go and kill your cattle to eat. At 
the time we lived with the French, our first father we were 
happy, they never said anything to us, Since we have known 
our father the Long Knife, there are always some complaints 
though we do not think to do them any harm, at present that 
we are endeavouring to make our wives and children live, we 
do not dare set fire; when we do set fire, we think ourselves 
distant from the settlemts — and we are close. In all Counsels 
we have been we are desired to hunt and not go to v.'ar, now 
we are quiet and hunting, and we believe to do right ; it is im- 
possible to hunt without setting fire. The whites arrive every 
day, they settle, we know nothing of it, and if they suffer in 
the fall, it is rather their fault than ours, because we do not 
know where they are. The master of Life gave us this land 
it is to live on and our wives and children, whilst you were on 
the other side of the Great Lake, that land was given you to 
live on. In all the Counsels our father has nothing but hard 
things to tell us, whilst we are endeavouring to do everything 
to please him, we strive to hunt in such places, as will be of 
no injury to them, and whilst we are endeavoring to do good, 
we find ourselves near the Long Knives who complains imme- 
diately, now that we think to do well, we are exposed to re- 
proaches, which renders our Life, a hard one, if we set fire to 
the weeds or grass, it is to live on the game, we have no other 
means to subsist. All that the maker of Life placed on the 
Earth is to live upon and we endeavour to live as in the times 
of our first fathers. Why do you reproach us of setting fire? 
You are glad to receive our skins, without which we would 
have none. In all our Counsels the Chiefs exhort us, to make 
our wives and Children live, it is our sole occupation and we 
strive to do no hurt to any person. We have had our first 
father the French, then the English and Spaniard, today we 
have our Father the Long Knife, who does not like our Con- 
duct. We are not the only ones who set fire, the Kaskaskians, 
the Shawnese and the Miamis have set fire ; as well as us. We 
know not of any horse belonging to the whites amongst us 
if there were any we should not hide it, we saw one light bay 
that the Miamis have that has the four feet and nose white. 



 

Proclamation Concerning Selling Liquor to Indians 

December 17, 1805 

Executive Journal, 12 

A Council or Conference with certain tribes of Indians being 
about to be held, the Governor Issued his proclamation pro- 
hibiting any Citizen or other person from giving Bartering or 
selling ardent spirits or other intoxicating liquors to any In- 
dian or Indians in the Town of Vincennes or within 30 miles 
of the same, until such Council or Conference shall be termi- 
nated, on pain of being dealt with agreeably to the provisions 
of the law in that case made and provided. (Abstract) 



Harrison to Secretary of War 

Vincennes 24th December 1805 

Har. Pa. 180-182 

Sir: 

In consequence of the great alarm which existed in the 
Illinois country from the Hostile dispositions which some par- 
ties of Kickapoos were said to have manifested towards the 
settlers by setting fire to their fences and hay stacks and 
otherwise abusing and insulting them I thought it highly ex- 
pedient and proper to send to them a respectable deputation 
to demand an explanation of their conduct and if it was found 
to be as criminal as it has been represented to insist upon 
the surrender of the culprits and an unequivocal declaration 
as to their future intentions. In order to give satisfaction 
to the citizens I selected two of the most respectable char- 
acters of that neighbourhood one an american [Shadrack 
Bond] and the other a Frenchman [Jean Perry] who have 
executed their commission much to my satisfaction and whose 
respective reports I have now the Honor to inclose. From 
these and from other information which I have procured I 
am convinced that the conflagrations complained of were en- 
tirely accidental and that the extensiveness of the mischief 
they have occasioned is to be attributed to the unusual 
drought of the season. 

General Wilkinson will have communicated to you the un- 
fortunate catastrophe which has befallen the Osages. As soon 
as I was informed of it I dispatched instructions to Messrs. 



 

Wells and Jouett' by a special express directing- to use their 
utmost endeavours to get possession of the prisoners that 
they may be restored to their friends. I have little doubt of 
their success as the most influencial of the Potawatimi chiefs 
are upright well meaning men. However disagreeable and 
afflicting this affair may be at the moment when we had flat- 
tered ourselves that a general pacification had been effected, 
the Patawatimies are certainly not so much to blame as they 
may appear to be upon a first view of the Transaction for 
the party which made the stroke were certainly uninformed 
of the Treaty at St. Louis nor could they know (from the 
time that they crossed the Mississippi) that anything of the 
kind was in aggitation. 

The murders committed on the Missouri and Saint Francois 
rivers have excited I understand much alarm in that coun- 
try. It is with great pleasure I inform you that the Tribes 
on this side of the Mississippi are as well disposed towards 
us as ever they have been. 

The Delawares are indeed extremely restless and uneasy, 
they are much dissatisfied with the Miamies and all the young 
men are very desirous to join their countrymen on the west 
side of the Mississippi. The chiefs and old men wish to re- 
main where they are and have applied to me to use my in- 
fluence to prevent the intended emigration. I have as yet 
returned them no answer because I wished to be informed 
whether their stay or removal would best comport with the 
views of the President. 

I have the honor to be with great respect and esteem Sir 
your humble servt.

I have had more difliculty in assembling the Piankeshaw 
chiefs and bringing them to reasonable terms than I at first 
apprehended. The Treaty will however be signed this day or 
tomorrow and will be forwarded by the next mail.

Harrison to the Dela wares 

Early in 1806 
Dawson, Harrison, 8S 

Speech of Governor Harrison, delivered to the Delaware 
Indians, on the delusion which prevailed among them with 
respect to sorcery.^ 

1. Harrison thought this was a carefully laid plan ot Tecumseh and the Prophet 
to get rid of the Indian chiefs and reorganize the tribes. Joseph Renard's son had been 
deposed among the Kickapoos and Winnemac was marked. Little Turtle was ignored 
and the old chief Teteboxti of the Delawares murdered. He usurped the power of the 
Shawnee chiefs so much that they applied to Harrison for protection. They had fol- 
lowers in evei-y tribe within a hundred miles and it seems they insisted on their converts 
acknowledging the chieftainship of the Prophet. 



 

My Children — 

My heart is filled with grief, and my eyes are dissolved in 
tears, at the news which has reached me. You have been 
celebrated for your wisdom above all the tribes of red people 
who inhabit this great island. Your fame as warriors has 
extended to the remotest nations, and the wisdom of your 
chiefs has gained for you the appellation of grand-fathers 
from all the neighboring tribes. From what cause, then, 
does it proceed, that you have departed from the wise coun- 
cils of your fathers, and covered yourselves with guilt. 

My children, tread back the steps you have taken, and en- 
deavor to regain the straight road which you have abandoned. 
The dark, crooked and thorny one which you are now pur- 
suing will certainly lead to endless woe and misery. But who 
is this pretended prophet who dares to speak in the name of 
the Great Creator? Examine him. Is he more wise or vir- 
tuous than you are yourselves, that he should be selected to 
convey to you the orders of your God? Demand of him some 
proofs at least of his being the messenger of the Deity. If 
God has really employed him he has doubtless authorized him 
to perform some miracles, that he may be known and re- 
ceived as a prophet. If he is really a prophet, ask of him to 
cause the sun to stand still — the moon to alter its course — 
the rivers to cease to flow — or the dead to rise from their 
graves. If he does these things, you may then believe that 
he has been sent from God. He tells you that the Great 
Spirit commands you to punish with death those who deal 
in magic, and that he is authorized to point them out. 
Wretched delusion ! Is, then, the Master of life obliged to em- 
ploy mortal man to punish those who offend Him? Has he 
not the thunder and all the powers of nature at his com- 
mand? — and could he not sweep away from the earth a whole 
nation with one motion of his arm? 

My children! do not believe that the great and good Cre- 
ator of mankind has directed you to destroy your own flesh; 
and do not doubt but that, if you pursue this abominable 
wickedness, his vengeance will overtake and crush you. 

The above is addressed to you in the name of the Seventeen 
Fires. I now speak to your from myself, as a friend who 
wishes nothing more sincerely than to see you prosperous 
and happy. Clear your eyes, I beseech you, from the mist 



 

which surrounds them. No longer be imposed upon by the 
arts of an impostor. Drive him from your town, and let 
peace and harmony once more prevail amongst you. Let your 
poor old men and women sleep in quietness, and banish from 
their minds the dreadful idea of being burnt alive by their 
own friends and countrymen. I charge you to stop your 
bloody career; and if you wish the friendship of your great 
father the President if you wish to preserve the good opinion 
of the Seventeen Fires, let me hear, by the return of the 
bearer, [Capt. William Prince] that you have determined to 
follow my advice. 



Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES, 1st January, 1806 

American State Papers, Indian Affairs, I, 705 
Sir : I have the honor to forward the treaty concluded with 
the Piankeshaws, on the 30th ultimo. [Peters, Indian Treaties, 
100] It will, I hope, be found such as I promised it should 
be, i. e. highly advantageous to the United States; nor is it 
by any means a bad bargain for the Indians themselves. The 
annuity which is now promised, together with that which 
they formerly received, will be a certain resource to them, 
when they shall be no longer able to procure subsistence from 
the chase. In the course of the negotiation, I had promised 
that the United States would, for five years, bear the ex- 
pense of repairing their guns, but I forgot to insert it in the 
treaty. It would, perhaps be found more economical to send 
an armorer to this place, to work altogether for the Indians, 
than to employ the artizans on the spot, whose prices are 
most enormously extravagant, as you will obsei^ve by exam- 
ining their accounts, heretofore forwarded. The neighboring 
tribes will be highly pleased with such an indulgence, for 
which they have made frequent application. 

It is, in my opinion, essentially necessary that the law 
regulating the trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, 
should be so altered at the present session of Congress, as to 
prohibit any person from trading with the Indians, anywhere 
upon the lands of the United States, without a licence. The 
title to so large a portion of the Indian country has been 
extinguished, from which a great number of them still draw 



 

their support, that it is much to be feared they will fall a 
sacrifice to the merciless rapacity of the traders, unless they 
are restrained by the same penalties to which those are sub- 
jected who reside at the Indian towns. 

Notwithstanding the recent murder of two white men on 
the Missouri, by three Indians (as it is supposed) from this 
territory, viz : a Miami, Pattawatamy, and a Kickapoo, I can 
with confidence repeat to you the assurances lately given, of 
the pacific disposition of the tribes under my superintendence. 
The three murders certainly belong to the banditti of the 
Illinois river, of which the noted Turkey-foot was the chief.' 
Governor Wilkinson, hearing that two of them were at no 
great distance from him, has very properly demanded them 
of the Kickapoo chief, who had them in his custody. I shall 
endeavor to secure the other as soon as possible. 

I have the honor to be, with the most perfect respect, sir, 
your humble servant, 

William Henry Harrison 

P. S. The tract now ceded is about eighty or ninety miles 
wide, from the northwest corner of the Vincennes tract to 
the Kaskaskia cession, and about the same distance from that 
line to the Ohio.

Dear Sir 

Your several unacknowledged letters of June 16, Aug. 29, 
Nov. 12 & 20 prove me an unpunctual correspondent, it is 
not because I do less than I might do, but that there is more 

1. "A small impediment to the growth of the settlement was the killing of Dennis 
and Van Meter by the Indians in 1802. Turkey Foot, an evil-disposed and cruel chief 
of a band of the Pottawatomie Indians, and his party returning home from Cahokia 
to their town toward Chicago, met Dennis and Van Meter at the foot of the Missis- 
sippi Bluff, about five miles southwest of the present town of Edwardsville (III.). The 
country contained at that day very few inhabitants above Cahokia, and Turkey Foot, 
seeing the Americans extending their settlements toward his country, caught fire at 
the spectacle and killed these two men. These Indians may have been intoxicated, as 
they were frequently drunk when they were trading in Cahokia. This was not con- 
sidered war, but a kind of Indian depredation." 

Reynolds, Pioneer Hist, of III. iSO 



 

than I can do. I will now summarily reply to their several 
articles. And first I pray you to deliver to the legislature 
the inclosed letter in answer to the Address they favored me 
with, of the two persons [Bond and Perry] chosen to supply 
the place of Mr. Hay in the legislative council, I nominated 
Mr. Bond, which nomination has been with others 3 weeks 
before the senate, so has that of Judge [John] Griffin^ for 
the Michigan territory. I am told it is doubtful whether the 
Senate mil confirm this last [Conf. Jan. 9, 1806]. I have 
earnestly inculcated the necessity of raising the salaries of 
the territorial governors & judges, and it will be attempted 
this session ; but with what success is very doubtful. [Raised 
to $1,200, Mar. 3, 1807] 

the British have clearly no right to trade with the Indians 
in Louisiana, it is therefore decided to keep that trade to 
ourselves as the only means of governing those Indians 
peaceably, this will render it important to be particularly 
friendly to the Sacs, Foxes, Kickapoos, Sioux, & other In- 
dians residing on the borders between the British & us; and 
by taking their pelts & furs at higher prices, & selling them 
goods at lower prices than the trade will bear without loss, 
to let them see their own interest in an exclusive adhesion 
to us. what we lose with them, we must make up from other 
quarters, our principle being neither to gain nor lose on the 
whole Indian trade taken together, the late stroke^ of the 
Poutewatamis on the Osages must be strongly reprimanded, 
and no exertion spared to recover & restore the prisoners & 
make satisfaction for the killed, the Indians on this side 
the Missisipi must understand that that river is now ours, 
& is not to be a river of blood, if we permit those on this 
side to cross it to war against the other side, we must permit 
the other side to come over to this for revenge, the safety 
of our settlements will not admit of this, and in the present 
case of the Poutewatamies they should be made to under-

2. "Sometime in the latter part of 1805 a war party of the Potawatamie tribe had 
crossed the Mississippi on an e.xcursion about the time the treaty was made at St. 
Louis between the Osages and Potawatamies and on falling in with a hunting camp 
of Osages had killed or carried off 73 women and children. This was done when all 
the men were away hunting. The Osages at once notified Governor Wilkinson." Dawson.

stand that unless they make to the Osages every satisfaction 
in their power, & satisfy us they will cease crossing the Mis- 
sipi to war on nations which never injured them, we may 
give a free passage & support to the Osages to come over 
and take such revenge as will glut them, but it is from the 
Secretary of War that you \vill receive what is to be con- 
sidered as official, & as your guide in this business, among 
the Misipi Indians now here, is one Poutawatami chief, noth- 
ing has yet been said to him on this subject, but some ex- 
planations will take place before he leaves us, which prob- 
ably will not be till late in February. Accept my friendly

House Report, — Slavery 

February 14, 1806 
Am. Sta. Pa. Misc. I, 450 

Mr. Garnett', from the committee appointed Dec. 18, 1805, 
to whom were referred the I'eport of a select committee, made 
on the 17th of February, 1804, [see same date above] on a let- 
ter of William Henry Harrison, [see Dec. 22, 1802] president 
of a convention held at Vincennes, in the Indiana Territory, 
[see Nov. 22, 1802, above] declaring the consent of the people 
of the said Territory to a suspension of the sixth article of 
compact between the United States and the said people ; [Nov. 

1. This committee was composed of James M. Garnett i 
C. Benjamin Parke of Ind., Philip van Cortlandt of N. Y 
Matthew Walton of Ky., and a Mr. Smith of S. Car. 



 

22, 1802, above] also on a memorial and petition of the in- 
habitants of the said Territory; [see Oct. 10, 1807] also on 
the petition of the Legislative Council and House of Repre- 
sentatives of the said Territory ; [see Feb. 12, 1807, and Sept. 
19, 1807, above] together with the petition of certain purchas- 
ers of land, settled and intending to settle on that pai-t of the 
Indiana Territory ; west of the Ohio, and east of the boundary 
line running from the mouth of the Kentucky river; and on 
two memorials from the inhabitants of Randolph and St. Clair 
— made the following report : 

That having attentively considered the facts stated in the 
said petitions and memorials, they are of opinion that a quali- 
fied suspension, for a limited time, of the sixth article of com- 
pact between the original States and the people and States 
west of the river Ohio, would be beneficial to the people of the 
Indiana Territory. The suspension of this article is different 
from that between slavery and freedom, inasmuch as it would 
merely occasion the removal of persons, already slaves, from 
one part of the country to another. The good effects of this 
suspension, in the present instance, would be to accelerate the 
population of that Territory, instead of seeking as they are 
now compelled to do, settlements in other States or countries 
permitting the introduction of slaves. The condition of the 
slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by it, as it is 
evident, from experience that the more they are separated 
and diffused, the more care and attention are bestowed on . 
them by their masters, each proprietor having it in his power 
to increase their comforts and conveniences in proportion to 
the smallness of their numbers. The dangers, too, (if any 
are to be apprehended,) from too large a black population 
existing in any one section of country, would certainly be very 
much diminished, if not entirely removed. But whether dan- 
gers are to be feared from this source or not, it is certainly an 
obvious dictate of sound policy to guard against them as far as 
possible. If this danger does exist, or there is any cause to 
apprehend it, and our Western brethren are not only willing 
but desirous to aid us in taking precautions against it, would 
it not be wise to accept their assistance? We should benefit 
ourselves, without injuring them, as their population must al- 
ways so far exceed any black population which can ever exist 
in that country, as to render the idea of danger from that 
source chimerical. 



 

Your committee consider the regulation, contained in the 
ordinance for the government of the territory of the United 
States, which requires a freehold of fifty acres of land as a 
qualification for an elector of the General Assembly, as limit- 
ing too much the elective franchise. Some restriction, how- 
ever, being necessary, your committee conceive that a resi- 
dence continued long enough to evince a determination to 
become a permanent inhabitant, should entitle a person to the 
rights of sufl:rage. This probationary period need not extend 
beyond twelve months. 

The petition of certain settlers in the Indiana Territory, 
[Dearborn County] praying to be annexed to the State of 
Ohio, ought not, in the opinion of your committee be granted. 

It appears to your committee that the division of the Indi- 
ana Territory, in the manner directed by the ordinance of 
1787, and for which the people of Randolph and St. Clair have 
petitioned your honorable body, would be inexpedient at this 
time. The people of the two sections have lately entered into 
the second grade of government, the whole expense of which 
would fall on the people of one section, if a division were now 
to be made. This, in the opinion of your committee, would be 
neither politic nor just. But, although a division of the Terri- 
tory appears improper at this time, we think it should be made 
as soon as the population of either section has increased so far 
as to entitle them to form a State Government. The petition 
which prays that such a Government may be formed, by unit- 
ing the two sections as soon as their inhabitants shall have 
augmented so far as to authorize it, your committee conceive 
ought not to be granted. A territory, when once erected into 
a State, cannot be divided or dismembered without its own 
consent; the formation therefore, of two States out of this 
Territory, originally intended by the ordinance of 1787, could 
not constitutionally be effected, if the two sections were once 
permitted to form one State, without the consent of that State, 
however necessary the extent and population of that Terri- 
tory might render such division. 

After attentively considering the various objects desired in 
the memorials and petitions, the committee respectfully sub- 
mit to the House the following resolutions : 

1. Resolved, That the sixth article of the ordinance of 
1787, which prohibits slavery within the Indiana Territory, 
be suspended for ten years, so as to permit the introduction 



 

of slaves, born within the United States, from any of the indi- 
vidual States. 

2. Resolved, That every white freeman of the age of 
twenty-one years, who has resided within the Territory twelve 
months, and within the county in which he claims a vote, six 
months, immediately preceding the election, shall enjoy the 
rights of an elector of the General Assembly. 

3. Resolved, That the petition of certain settlers in the 
Indiana Territory, praying to be annexed to the State of Ohio, 
ought not to be granted. 

4. Resolved, That it is inexpedient, at this time, to grant 
that part of the petition of the people of Randolph and St. 
Clair [counties in 111.] which prays for a division of the In- 
diana Territory. 

5. Resolved, That so much of the petition of the Legis- 
lative council and House of Representatives of the Indiana 
Territory as prays that the two sections may be united into 
one State Government, ought not to be granted.

Pike to Harrison 

[Extracts of a letter from Lieut. [Zebulon M.] Pike to Gov- 
ernor Harrison] 

28th June 1806 

Bisselt Mss. 7, St. Louis Mercantile Library 

I have observed by a Letter and Deposition of Capt. Daniel 
Bissell, that Mr. B. [Lemuel] Harrison wrote you a letter, 



 

complaining of me, and asserting that I had basely treated him 
(in connection with Captain Bessell) by taking a House from 
him in his absence. 

This circumstance is fully explained by Capt. Daniel 
Bissell's Deposition, and I should never have conceived his 
letter as worthy my further notice. But allow me to say that, 
the nature of your Notes on that letter were such as wounded 
my feelings and more deeply as they came from a character, 
whom I had always been induced (as well from duty as in- 
clination) to respect and esteem. Your note says "He ought 
to have looked to Parkinson for redress and "to have made 
use of the Arms of the United States which was put under his 
direction for different purposes. To dispossess the person 
who has obtained a legal possession". It would be difficult 
to when where in any passage of L. Harrison's letter, (even 
admitting it directly true) would justify the foregoing con- 
clusion, of my having taken possession by force of Arms. 
And, when we refer to Cap. Bissell's Deposition, we will per- 
ceive, that I obtained a peaceable and legal possession of prop- 
erty, which I had been some years illegally deprived of. It is 
unnecessary for me to attempt to be the panegyrist of Capt. 
Bissell's character; but I presume that no person can for one 
minute doubt his having acted with no unpropriety in this 
affair, and, that the insinuations of Mr. L. Harrison, was as 
unfounded and groundless as many others raised by the Scoun- 
drels who resided in the vicinity of Massac. 

As the before mentioned Documents were handed to my 
Colonel [Bissell] I should be happy if Governor Harrison felt 
himself at liberty, to honer me with a line, expi-essing his sat- 
isfaction of the foregoing explanation.

to be minutely interpreted to them; you will add to it such 
observations as may occur to you, to enforce upon them the 
belief that the United States are extremely desirous to pre- 
serve a friendly intercourse with them, and will not commence 
hostilities unless driven to it by the conduct of the Indians 
themselves. But if they should be forced into a war, after 
having done every thing in their power to avoid it, the Kicka- 
poos must take the penalty of their own rashness. It will be 
of advantage to dwell upon the immense force of mounted 
militia which the United States can bring upon them from the 
neighboring states of Kentucky and Ohio, and the Louisiana 
and Indiana territories. It may also be suggested to them, that 
(a feAV stragglers excepted) there is not the smallest probabil- 
ity of their receiving any aid from the Potawatamies, 
Miamies, Weas, or Delawares, who have too just a sense of the 
danger of their situation, to engage in any such rash enter- 
prise. 

After having delivered the speech to the chiefs at the Ver- 
million if you should discover that there is no danger of pro- 
ceeding to the villages on the Prairies, (and you are not on 
any account to expose yourself to any danger,) you will go 
there, and, if possible, prevail on Joseph Renard's son,= their 
head chief, to accompany you to both places. You will omit 
no means of obtaining information, as to the general disposi- 
tion of the Indians, as it relates to peace or war; and the re- 
sources which they calculate on for carrying on a war, par- 
ticularly their means of procuring arms and ammunition, and 
the deposites they may have of either. Should time and other 
circumstances unite, to make it proper in your opinion, to pro- 
ceed to the Potawatamie villages on the Wabash, you will do 
so ; but, at any rate, I wish you to go to the Delaware towns, 
on White river to deliver the speech which I have sent to them, 
for the purpose of explaining to them the circumstances re- 
lating to the escape of Red,' who murdered one of their men. 
Whilst you are there, you will collect such information as you

establishments of the Eel river and Miami Indians, on White 
river, and Sugar creek. Your having been at St. Louis at the 
time the Kickapoo was killed by Mr. Hammond, which is given 
as the reason of their discontent, you will have it in your 
power to explain the circumstance, and convince them it was 
purely accidental. You may also assure them that the pres- 
ents to the relations of the deceased will not be withheld. 

William Henry Harrison 

July ? 1806 

William Henry Harrison, Governor and Commander in 
Chief of the Indiana Territory, and Superintendent of 
Indian Affairs, to his Children, the Chiefs and Warriors 
of the Kickapoo tribe. 

My Children: 

I lately sent you a message by one of your warriors, but I 
have not yet received an answer. The head chief of the Weas 
[Lapousier] has however been with me, and has assured me 
that you still keep hold of the chain of friendship which has 
bound you to your father, since the treaty made with general 
Wayne. 

My Children, this information has given me great pleasure, 
because I had heard that you had suffered bad thoughts to get 
possession of your minds. 

My Children, what is it you wish for? have I not often told 
you that you should inform me of all your gi-ievances, and 
that you should never apply to your father in vain ? 

My Children, be wise; do not follow the advice of those who 
would lead you to destruction ; what is it they would persuade 
you to? — To make war upon your fathers, the Seventeen 
Fires? — What injury has your father done you? — If he has 
done any, why do you not complain to him and ask redress? — 
Will he turn a deaf ear to your complaints? — He has always 
listened to you, and will listen to you still ; you will certainly 
not raise your arm against him. 

My Children, you have a number of young warriors, but 
when compared to the warriors of the United States, you know 
they are but as a handful. 



 

My Children, can you count the leaves on the trees, or the 
grains of sand in the river banks? So numerous are the 
warriors of the Seventeen Fires. 

My Children, it would grieve your father to let loose his 
warriors upon his red children; nor will he do it unless you 
compel him ; he had rather that they would stay at home and 
make corn for their women and children ; but he is not afraid 
to make war ; he knows that they are brave. 

My Children, he has men armed with all kinds of weapons; 
those who live on the big waters and in the big towns, under- 
stand the use of muskets and bayonets, and those who live on 
this side the mountains use the same arms that you do. 

My Children, the Great Spirit has taught your fathers to 
make all the arms and ammunition which they use ; but you do 
not understand this art; if you should go to war with your 
fathers, who would supply you with those things? The 
British cannot; we have driven them beyond the lakes, and 
they cannot send a trader to you without our permission. 

My Children, open your eyes to your true interests; your 
father wishes you to be happy. If you wish to have your 
minds set at ease, come and speak to him. 

My Children, the young man who carries this is my friend, 
and he will speak to you in my name ; listen to him as if I were 
to address you, and treat him with kindness and hospitality.

nursery fills much faster than my strong box and if our future 
progress in this way is as great as it has been and our Gov- 
ernment should adopt the Roman policy of bestowing rewards 
on those who contribute most to the population of the country

I have taken the liberty to enclose herewith a paragraph 
from the Farmers library the vehicle of the abuse which a cer- 
tain Isaac Darneille^ has poured upon me for many months 
past under the signature of Decius and which I believe was 
foi-warded to you subscribed with his own name — This re- 
cantation was not extorted by the dread of powder and ball or 
steel — Arguments which I have long declined the use of in 
private quarrels but from the dread of the indignation of 12 
of the Citizens of Kentucky who were about to decide upon the 
merits of his accusations. 

I am sorry to inform you that the Indians on the Illinois 
river and the neighbourhood of the Lakes discover a good deal 
of that kind of restlessness & Jealousy which usually precede 
a rupture and if the information I have just received be cor- 
rect there is a probability that we shall shortly receive some 
pretty strong manifestations of the enmity of the Sacs and 
Kickapoos. 

An elderly Squaw who resides at the principal Wea village 
about 50 miles from the place has communicated to me 
through a trader of unquestionable veracity that about 10 days 
ago a Kickapoo arrived in their village with a war belt invit- 
ing the Weas to join his nation and the Sacs in a war against 
the United States. The belt and speech were delivered as the 
squaw says to the Wea chiefs — She further said that she had 
conversed with the bearer of the belt & demanded the reasons 
which induced the Kickapoos to go to war with the Americans 
who were strong enough to destroy all the Indians in a very 
short time. He answered that all this was well understood 
but that they had received so many injuries from the Amer- 
icans that they were determined to perish to a man rather than 
not revenge them — I do not believe this tale altho I think it 
highly probable that some part of the Conversation passed be-

at Caholiia. He seems to have been a preacher in Maryland but in the west he played 
the Chesterfield in a social way and engaged in land speculation and law for a liveli- 
hood. He was engaged in a number of discreditable episodes and finally became a school 
teacher in western Ky. where he died in 1830. He had a good classical education. His

tween the Kickapoo &. the squaw. I have the highest confi- 
dence in the Wea chief- — I know he has a warm friendship 
for me & I am sure he would have communicated the proposi- 
tion which the Kickapoos are said to have made to him if there 
was really any such made — The affair however deserves at- 
tention & I shall take care to have it properly investigated — 
the result of my enquiries shall be communicated to the Sec-

In a letter which I did myself the honor to write to you some 
time in the last Summer I took the liberty to request the 
Appointment of Judge of this Territory if a vacancy should 
occur for my brother in law Mr Coupland whose embarrassed 
Circumstances would have been much relieved by such an ap- 
pointment — If however Mr Coupland should not be deemed a 
proper person or should decline the office I beg leave to solicit 
it for my friend Mr [Benjamin] Parke our Delegate to Con- 
gress who is also the Attorney General of the Territory & who 
unites all the qualifications requisite for such an appointment 
I believe that he would be more acceptable to the people of 
the Territory as a Judge than any other who could be ap- 
pointed.

Shall I say in return I have a boon to ask of you, of no or- 
dinary import? No, I will not! because the commutation 
would dishonor my application ; but I will demand from your 



 

friendship a boon, in its influence coextensive with the Union ; 
a boon, perhaps on which that Union may much depend; a 
boon, which from my knowledge of men, motives, and prin- 
ciples, will be acceptable to those whose politics we are bound 
to support. If you ask, what is this important boon which 
I so earnestly crave? I will say to you, return the bearer to 
the councils of our country, where his talents and abilities 
are all-important at the present moment. But you continue, 
how is this to be done? By your fiat! Let Mr. [Benjamin] 
Parks adhere to his profession; convene your Solomons and 
let them return him (Colonel Burr) to Congress. If you 
taste this proposition, speak to him, and he will authorize you 
to purchase, if necessary, an estate for him in your Terri- 
tory.'

Dear Sir 

You must by this time suppose me one of the worst cor- 
respondents in the World & I have no inclination to deny the 
charge for all my friends tell me so & what every one be- 
lieves must be true. I wrote to you however about six weeks 
ago by Col. [Francis] Vigo but as that gentleman did not 
visit your post as he intended when he set out from this 
place the letter was returned to me & I intended to have 
wi-itten by Mr. [Charles] Gratiot but he left this place with- 
out my knowing it having called at my house when I was 
absent. Your letter of the 4th of April last was duly re- 
ceived & removed every difficulty with regard to the affair 
of T. Harrison — indeed I never had an idea that Lt. Pike for 
whom I have a great esteem & friendship had done anything 
more in that affair than what would have been considered 
when subjected to the most serious scrutiny as an act of im- 
prudence Such as I myself have committed whilst in a military 
command & such as all men of ardent minds are likely to 
commit. I have appointed Mr. [Gratiot?] Quater a magis- 
trate & I am very glad to find from are mutual friend 

1. This is only a fragment of the letter. Compare Wilkinson's testimony at Burr's 
trial when he said he would go to jail rather than produce the entire letter from 
Harrison. 



 

Whittlock that he will be agreeable to you. I intended to 
have given him a letter to your requesting your advice and 
assistance in the performing of his duty respecting which 
he may be at a loss from his limited acquaintance with our 
language manners & laws — I think that a good understand- 
ing between you may be production of mutual advantages & 
tend to preserve tranquility in the settlement adjacent to your 
post. 

With much Respect & Esteem I am Dr. Sir, Your Humbl.

Harrison: Message to Legislature 

November 3, 1806 

Dillon, History of Indiana, U23-U2U 

In a message which was delivered before the territorial 
legislature of Indiana, in 1806, Governor Harrison stated that 
he had received from all the Indian tribes, under his super- 
intendence, "the most solemn assurances of a disposition, on 
their part, to preserve inviolate their relations of amity with 
the United States." The same message contains the follow- 
ing passages in relation to the condition of Indian affairs at 
that period : 

They [the Indians] will never have recourse to arms, I 
speak of those in our immediate neighborhood, unless driven 
to it by a series of injustice and oppression. Of this they 
already begin to complain ; and I am sorry to say that their 
complaints are far from being groundless. It is true that 
the general government has passed laws for fulfilling, not 
only the stipulation contained in our treaty, but also those 
sublimer duties which a just sense of our prosperity and their 
wretchedness seem to impose. The laws of the territory pro- 
vide, also the same punishment for offenses committed against 
Indians as against white men. Experience, however, shows 
that there is a wide difference in the execution of those laws. 
The Indian always suffers, and the white man never. This 
partiality has not escaped their penetration, and has afforded 
them an opportunity of making the proudest comparisons be- 
tween their own observance of treaties and that of their 
boasted superiors. If, in your review of our penal code, gen- 
tlemen, any regulation should suggest itself which would 



 

promise more impartiality in the execution of the laws in 
favor of this unhappy people, the adoption of it will be highly 
acceptable to the government of the United States and honor- 
able to yourselves. But should you suppose it dangerous to 
make any discrimination in their favor, I pray you to lose 
no opportunity of inculcating, among your constituents, an 
abhorrence of that unchristian and detestable doctrine which 
would make a distinction of guilt between the murder of a 
white man and an Indian/

Permit me to introduce to your acquaintance Captain

character and manners have gained him the respect and 
esteem of all who have had the pleasure of an introduction 
to him. He is to command the troops that are stationed in 
your neighborhood and from what I know of him myself 
and what I have heard from others upon whom I can rely a 
more fortunate selection could not have been. I must ask 
the favour of you to make him acquainted with Messrs Gratiot 
and Fouland and the rest of my friends in your to\vn.

Considering the various and extravagant reports^ which 
circulate conceiTiing me, it may not be unsatisfactory to you 

1. This message was addressed to the Second Session of the First General Assembly, 
which met at Vincennes, November 3, 1806, and enacted twenty-eight laws. The full 
text of this message has not been found : but from a passage in No. 30 it is evident 
that one of the Governor's recommendations was a revision of the plan of taxation. 

1. James House was bom in Conn, enlisted Feb. 22, 1799, from Penn. as a 
lieutenant in the artillery; became paymaster 1799: captain 1805; colonel 1822; Brig. 
Gen., 1832, died Nov. 17, 1834. Heitman, Register, 5H

Frankfort grand jury. This is evidently the letter which Harrison says almost misled 
him. 



 

to be informed (and to you there can be no better source of 
information than myself) that I have no wish or design to 
attempt a separation of the Union, that I have no connection 
with any foreign power or government, that I never medi- 
tated the introduction of any foreigni power or influence into 
the United States, or any part of its territories, but on the 
contrary should repel with indignation any proposition or 
measure having that tendency; in fine, that I have no project 
or views hostile to the interest or tranquillity or union of 
the United States, or prejudicial to its government, and I 
pledge my honor to the truth of this declaration. It is true 
that I am engaged in an extensive speculation, and that with 
me are associated some of your intimate and dearest friends. 
The objects are such as every man of honor and every good 
citizen must approve. They have been communicated to sev- 
eral of the principal officers of our government, particularly 
to one in the confidence of the administration. He has as- 
sured me my views would be grateful to the administration. 
Indeed, from the nature of them, it can not be otherwise, 
and I have no doiibt of having received your active support, 
if a personal communication with you could have been had. 

Waller Taylor to Harrison 

Louisville, January 12, 1807 

Dillon, History of Indiana iSl 

I arrived at Jefi'ersonville on Saturday morning last, after 
an extremely disagreeable journey, occasioned by the badness 
of the roads, and the difficulty of making our stages of a 
night. The public mind at this place appears to be much 
agitated, on account of Colonel [Aaron] Burr's mysterious 
movements.^ Conjectures are various about his intentions; 
but nothing certain has transpired to throw any light on his 
views. There is stationed at this place about two hundred 
militia, who examine all boats that descend the river. No 
discoveries have yet been made by them ; and only two boats 

1. Burr's movements had been the chief object of interest in the Ohio Valley since 
the summer of 1805. Davis Floyd had been active in his support, building and loading 
boats. Burr had visited Harrison at Vincennes, with what result is not known. So 
far as is known Harrison offered no opposition. Taylor was perhaps sent on this 
trip by the governor to watch developments. Butler, Histori/ of Kentuckji, SSO, says 
Burr made advances to Harrison but the latter repelled him. It seems that Burr 
Bent Captain Westcott to Harrison but without results. 



 

have yet been detained, which were built by Burr's direction 
at Jeff ersonvi lie, or this place, I am not certain which. A 
large drove of horses, said to be purchased for the expedition, 
will be seized to-day, by the civil authority of the State. It 
seems to me that the precautions now taken are perfectly 
useless ; because Burr, I believe has got all the force he could 
raise from this State, and is, probably, before this time, at 
Natchez. 



Slavery Petition 

February 12, 1807 

Annuls of Ninth Congress, Sec. Sess. i82 
Am. Sta. Pa. Misc. I, 477 

Mr. Parke, from the committee' to whom was referred the 
letter of William Henry Harrison, Governor of the In- 
diana Territory, enclosing certain resolutions of the Leg- 
islative Council and House of Representatives of the said 
Territory, made the following report : 
That the resolutions of the Legislative Council and House 
of Representatives of the Indiana Territory relate to a sus- 
pension for the term of ten years, of the sixth article of com- 
pact between the United States and the Territories and States 
northwest of the river Ohio, passed the 13th July, 1787. That 
article declares "there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary 
servitude in the said Territory." 

The suspension of the said article would operate an imme- 
diate and essential benefit to the Territory, as emigration to 
it will be inconsiderable for many years except from those 
States where slavery is tolerated ; and although it is not con- 
sidered expedient to force the population of the Territory, 
yet it is desirable to connect its scattered settlements, and, in 
regard to political rights, to place it on an equal footing witli 
the different states. From the interior situation of the Ter- 
ritory, it is not believed that slaves would ever become so 
numerous as to endanger the internal peace or future pros- 
perity of the country. The current of emigration flowing to 
the western country, the Territories ought all to be opened 

1. This committee consisted of Benjamin Parlte of Ind.. John Rhea of Tenn.. 
Jeremiah Morrow of Ohio, Willis Alston of N. C, Josiah Masters of N. Y., Thomas 
Sanford of Ky., and Abram Trigg of Va. The petition from Indiana is given in 
Annals of Congress, Jan. 20, 1807. 



 

to their introduction. The abstract question of liberty and 
slavery is not involved in the proposed measure, as slavery 
now exists to a considerable extent in different parts of the 
Union ; it would not augment the number of slaves, but merely 
authorize the removal to Indiana of such as are held in bond- 
age in the United States. If slavery is an evil, means ought 
to be devised to render it least dangerous to the community, 
and by which the hapless situation of the slaves would be 
most ameliorated; and to accomplish these objects, no meas- 
ure would be so effectual as the one proposed. The commit- 
tee, therefore, respectfully submit to the House the following 
resolution : 

Resolved, That it is expedient to suspend, from and after 
the 1st day of January 1808 the sixth article of compact be- 
tween the United States and the Territories and States north- 
west of the river Ohio, passed the 13th day of July, 1787, for 
the term of ten years.

Jeffe)-f!on Papers, 2d Series, Vol. Sd, No. 50 
Dr Sir 

Mr Davis Floyd' who was so unfortunate as to have become 
the dupe of the artful & mischievous Aaron Burr- has re- 
quested me to write to you in his favor, and to State his 
Standing and Character in this Territory before his late ex- 
pedition. I have been intimately acquainted with this Gentle- 
man for Six Years and I can truly affirm that there was not 
a man in the Territory, who possessed more intirely my Con- 
fidence & esteem, As sheriff of the County [Clark] in which 
he resided. Representative in the Legislature and an Officer 
in the Militia, (in which he held the rank of Major) his Con- 
duct was equally honorable to himself and useful to his fel- 
low Citizens nor do I believe that there is any man who pos- 
sessed a higher sense of Patriotism or more devotion to 
the Constitution of his Country, You will ask then how he 
came to engage in the late treasonable enterprise? The copy 
of Colo. Burrs'' letter to me which is inclosed will furnish the 
Solution from which You will See that the grosest falshoods 
were Used to entrap those whose honesty he knew to be proof 
against any proposal to violate the Laws of their Country, — 
This letter of Colo Burrs, was addressed to me in Conse- 
quence of Major Floyd and another Gentleman having waited 
on him at Louisville & declared their intention of abandoning 
him unless he would give to me the most explicit assurances 
in writing that his object was known to, and approved of by 
the Government, This You see he did not hesitate to do, and 

1. Davis Floyd openeJ a tavern at Clarkville in 1801, where he was a falls pilot 
for many years. He was actively associated with Burr for which he was tried and 
convicted, fined $10 and sentenced to jail for 3 hours. He moved to Corydon and rep- 
resented that county in the legislature; was circuit judge from 1816 to 1823 and was 
then appointed by Jefferson. Dec. 5, 1823, as a commissioner to adjust land claims

There is a literature on Aaron Burr, perhaps the best is Parton's Burr though it 

is rather hostile. Safford, The Blennerhassett Papers, and his Memoirs by M. L. Davis 

are good. The evidence is given in Am. Sta. Pa., Mis. I, 468-646. See also Dillon,

I must Confess that the Solemnity of his Declarations im- 
posed for Some time on me as well as Major Floyd.* 

4. On the third of Nov., 1806, U. S. attorney Joseph Davies asl<ed for an in- 
dictment against Burr. Judse Innes denied the application but at Burr's request 
granted it. Daviess said his witness could be there on the following Wednesday, but 
on that day announced that his witness, Davis Floyd, could not attend as he was 
attending the Indiana legislature, Parton, Burr, 
sent his colored servant with a dispatch sewed 
and D. F. (Davis Floyd) as follows: "If you 
you tomorrow night. In the meantime put all 

Floyd went down the Ohio and Mississippi with Burr. He had charge of a boat. 
This entry is in Blennerhassetfs journal for January 9, 1807: "Major Floyd's boat 
put ashore in consequence of being deterred by a sudden squall of wind." On Jan. 12: 
"This day Major Floyd joined us from Nachez." 

Safford, BIcnnerhassctt Papers. 187, 180 

On page 190 is a letter from Floyd to a U. S. Officer at Petit Gulf showing that 
Floyd was not conscious of opposing the U. S. Government. June 25, 1807, the Federal 
grand jury under Chief Justice Marshall, Henrico Co., Va. indicted Davis Floyd along 
with Burr for high treason. 

Parton. Life of Burr, II, 126 

Samuel Moxley testified at the trial of Burr. Sept. 21, that he joined Burr at the 
Falls in Captain Thomas Berry's boat. That Major Floyd's boat as well as Berry's was 
built at the Fails and loaded with provisions. Moxley was hired by Berry twelve miles 
back of Jeffersonville. 

AnnaU of Cong. 10th, first eess. I, iS6 

David risk testified that "some time in the month of September, 1806, a certain 
Davis Floyd, of the Indiana Territory, came to this affiant, and asked him if he did 
not wish to take a voyage down the river with him during the course of the fail or 
winter ; that he was going to settle a new country, the Washita, on the Red river. 
This happened either the next day. or a few days after Colonel Burr had left Jeffer- 
sonville, the residence of the said Floyd. At that time this affiant did not tell him 
whether he would go or not ; but about two or three weeks afterwards he did agree 
to go, the said Floyd having several times mentioned what a fine chance there would 
be for him : that they would not agree to give to any one man more than twelve dollars a 
month, and one hundred and fifty acres of land at the end of six months, besides clothes 
and provisions : but as he and this affiant were well acquainted, if he would have confi- 
dence in him, he would do something very clever for him ; and if they succeeded in 
their object, there would be fortunes made for all that went. This affiant asked what 
other object they had besides settling the Washita land. The said Floyd answered that 
there was a new road to be cut a great distance and several houses to be built, which 
would be a very profitable undertaking. No positive bargain was made between the 
said Floyd and this affiant. On the 16th of December, 1806, this affiant moved down the 
river from the falls of the Ohio, in the Indiana Territory, with the said Davis Floyd, 
with two boats and one batteau, which the said Floyd had built there. After the boats 
had left the falls of the Ohio three or four days, he discovered for the first time, on 
board one of Floyd's boats, a chest and a box, the former of which, it afterwards 
appeared, contained muskets and bayonets, a few fuses, and blunderbusses and pistol ; 
the latter rifles. A day or two afterwards, the said Floyd inquired of the men if they 
did not want, each of them, a gun to take care of : that he had some there which he 
was afraid would get rusty. The chest box was then opened, and all the arms taken 
out and cleaned and some of them occasionally used by the men in hunting as they 
went down the river. There were as near as he can judge, between twenty-five and 
thirty muskets with bayonets, two or three fuses, three or four blunderbusses, ten 
pairs of pistols and about eight or ten rifles. 

Some short time after the boats had joined Colonel Burr, and before they had 
got into the Mississippi river, while this affiant was lying sick on his trunk, he heard 
the said Floyd tell several of the men that they were going to take Baton Rouge and 
Mexico ; this affiant asked how they were going to do it with so few men : the said 
Floyd answered, that a large party of men were to join us at Natchez, and General 
Wilkinson and his army were to join us at the mouth of Red river. Nothing of im-

Sir: 

I wrote to you about eighteen months ago that some 
roumours unfavourable to the reputation of Mr. [Charles] 
Jouett' had reached me. I have however never found a per- 
son who would make any specific charge against him, Mr. 
Munro,- excepted who asserted that he had applied a part of 
the Public provisions to his own use. 

Mr. Jouett having heard that some unfavourable impres- 
sions had been made on my mind against him has now volun- 

]>ortance occuiTed till the boats got down to Bayou Piei*re. A day or two before their 
arrival there. Colonel Burr took a boat and four or five men. and went on ahead, as 
this affiant understood, to do some business, which he expected to do before the boats 
got down. Floyd's boat, in which he went himself, and in which this affiant was. 
arrived there on a Sunday morning, and the other boats not till the evening. On our 
arrival. Col. Burr was standing on the bank of the river, about a mile above the town : 
some short time after the men from our boat went ashore, this affiant saw Colonel Burr 
and a certain Robert A. New (who had the charge of Floyd's boat in his absence, he 
having then gone to Natchez) talking together for some time. The said New then 
came on board our boat, and called all the men into it, and said he understood they 
were all going to be stopped, and inquired of them whether they would stand by 
Colonel Burr and go on, or quit. Most of the men were for going on, but two or 
three were for quitting. In the course of that day, this affiant mentioned to the 
said New that he mistrusted they were going on some unlawful scheme. He assured 
3t, that nothing was going to take place but what was lawful

tarily come forward and declared his willingness to submit 
to any investigation that I might think proper to institute. 

His explanation of the circumstances which gave rise to 
Mr. Munro's accusation is entirely satisfactory and I have 
no hesitation in saying as far as I am acquainted with his 
conduct as a public officer he has acted with zeal and integrity. 
It is true that a great clamor has been raised against him at 
Detroit by persons in the British interest but this is easily 
accounted for as the establishments of an Indian agency at 
that place had a powerful effect in checking their illicit prac- 
tices in the Indian country.

Since you were here on last Friday the 10th inst. two of our 
scouts are in and report that last Sunday night, the 12th inst., 
a band of roving Indians captured a white family on the old 
Indian road from this place to Clarkesville this side of the 
mudhole [near where Otwell, Indiana, now stands] killed the 
man and took into captivity the woman and her five children.^

Captain William Hargrove : 

Your report by the hand of scout [Ell] Ernest has been re- 
ceived. The Governor is very much pleased at your prompt- 
ness. The supplies for the families of those who will serve as 
Rangers will be sent as often as needed. 

I have ordered sent you today, one sack of salt, ten bags of 
meal, for you to distribute before you leave home. Also 
twenty-five pounds of powder, twenty-five pounds of lead, two 
hundred gunflints, one bundle of tow [to clean rifles]. You 
will divide your force and form a squad of six men under a 
reliable man who will act as Sergeant to patrol the main 
travelled way from your settlement south to the Ohio river, 
at Red Banks [Henderson, Ky.]. Instruct the Sergeant to 
make two trips each way every ten days. I will send a scout 
who will come with the men and carts that bring the supplies. 
He will go on duty with the squad patrolling to the south. 
The other thirteen men will be with you ; also one scout and 
two friendly Indians. You are to patrol the old Indian trace 
[Vincennes — New Albany] that leads from this place to 
Clarksville on the Ohio river, from a point where this old road 
crosses White river [Wrights Ferry] and going as far as

Indiana, Harrison org;anized three divisions of rangers to patrol the main roads, espe-

the Second, but the captain of the Third is not known. This correspondence between 
Harrison and Hargrove is taken from Col. William M. Cockrum's valuable Pioneer

thirty-five miles east of the mudhole. The two Indians to be 
directly under the orders of the scout who will keep you in- 
formed of the orders he gives them. Once every week send a 
report of your work to this office. It has been ordered that 
movers coming over the old trace shall be held on the other 
end until a number of them are together. Then they will 
travel with the rangers as they are coming west on the trace. 
Any coming into your territory will be sent to a point out of 
danger by you, if coming to the older settlements. If they 
intend to form a new settlement, they must build a fort and 
stay in it until the season for raids has past. They can pre- 
pare houses where they intend to locate but they must remain 
in the blockhouses at night. If there should be extra men 
with the movers who have had experience as hunters or in 
Indian fighting enlist them if you can. I hope that your ex- 
perience in Indian warfare will help you protect your men. 
The roving bands of Indians prowling over this unprotected 
country in the warm season aim to murder helpless people for 
their scalps and the capturing of prisoners for what they can 
realize from the sale of them for servants to the British posts 
on the lakes. They are not hunting for armed soldiers. A 
careful and vigilant scouting service will in a great measure 
do away with these prowling bands of Indians.

Captain William Hargrove, in the Ranger Service of Indiana 
Territory: 
Your report by the half-breed Twenney came to hand this 
evening. The Governor wishes to say that he is well pleased 
with your work and fully agrees with you that the route from 
the forks of White river, south to the Yellow Banks on the 
Ohio river [Rockport, Indiana] should be patrolled at least 
once each week. The three men you have recruited can take 
the place of some of your best men that you are acquainted 
with. You will send them over the route in company with one 
of the scouts. The Governor suggests that you send scout 



 

[John] FuQuay' with them, as he is familiar with the coun- 
try south of you on the Ohio river. In your next report fully 
describe what was found on the Yellow Bank route and if 
any Indian sign has been seen near the Ohio river. 

It is utterly impossible at this time to furnish anything 
like a company of men to assist the father of Mrs. Larkins 
in releasing her from captivity. The Governor directs that 
you say to Colonel Greenup that if he can bring the aid from 
Kentucky that he thinks he can, that scouts and guides will 
be furnished them from this post and that he is truly sorry 
that he has not the men to furnish all the help needed.

Sir: 

On the 29th ultimo Gabriel, one of the Kaska. Indians 
(Brother-in-law to Ducoigne) was found dead on the Massac 
road about seven miles from this place. He was scalpt his 
scull cut in pieces with three strokes of the tomahawk two 
bullet holes thro' his body one entered the breast the other the 
left side, his left arm broke by the stroke of a ball — his Riffle, 
accoutrements, blanket cloath saddle and bridle were carried 
off. The sadle was found by a party of the Kasa. Indians 
who, the day after the murder was committed pursued the 
trail of a party of eight Indians in a direction towards the 
Kickapoo Towns. Two old blankets an old blue Cappeau and 
a Jole of bacon were left by the perpetrators with the dead 
body. Also an Indian war sign was found on the body. 
Ducoigne believes it to have been done by the Kickapoos or 
Potawatomies. A few days before this event happened, the 
Horse of Mr. Doza' on which he was riding was shot thro' the 
neck a little after dark, on the road leading to Prairie 
Durocher^ about two miles from this Village ; by the aid of a

flash of lightning Doza discovered two men whom he took to 
be Indians — a Horse belonging to a Mr. Patten was also shot 
thro the neck (and killed) by an Indian in the woods near the 
farm of Mr. Patten, at no great distance from the place where 
the murder was perpetrated. The bell on the horse which 
Mr. Patten's negro found the preceding morning was carried 
off ; the negro saw an Indian in pursuit of the Horse a short 
time before the horse was shot. 

Ducoigne as well as all his people are in a great dread at 
present. His situation is certainly a very unpleasant & un- 
safe one. Some strange Indians are said to be skulking about 
this place. The Kaskaskians have all come to the village and 
dare not venture out unless they are permitted to fire on the 
Indians whom they may meet in the woods. I have advised 
them to act only on the defensive for the present; to which 
he replied in a sarcastic way "Yes When I meet an Indian I 
must stand until he shoots me down, and then make a defence, 
and thus lose my life and the lives of my people. I have had 
ample protection promised to me by the United States and yet 
the officers do not interest themselves in my behalf. No es- 
cort can be obtained to bring in my dead people and they even 
doubt their authority to rescue me from an attack, under these 
circumstances I ought at least to be placed on a footing with 
my enemies". 

I stated to you in my former letter that some of our officers 
entertain eronious opinions as to the protection they are 
authorized to give to the Kasa. Indians in certain cases and 
suggested the propriety of giving instructions to the officers 
on this subject. I am Dear Sir

Captain Wm. Hargrove, In the Indian Ranger Service : 

Your report with enclosures have been received. The Gov- 
ernor feels very sorry that Colonel Greenup feels as he ex- 
presses himself. He ought to know and if reasonable would 
understand that to govern this wild territory and furnish half 
protection to the scattered settlers in this wilderness, that we 
have all we can do with the limited number of men that is at 
our command. It would be a very pleasing thing to aid your 
old soldier mate and recapture Mrs. Larkins and her children. 
It is but natural that her father should feel very anxious about 
her release but he could do nothing with the few men we could 
send him on such an expedition. After leaving the old Indian 
road that you are on there is no settlement north and it would 
take an army to invade the country north of White river. You 
will please convey to him the Governor's compliments and in- 
form him of the contents of the letter. As soon as it is pos- 
sible, we will give him all the aid we can, but it would do him 
no good to make the attempt with a few men as they would 
all be destroyed. 

The report of the three men on the trace south to the Yellow 
Banks is noted. There is most likely but little travel on that 
route. The one family which your men excorted to safty is 
a sufficient answer as to the usefulness of the patrol. They 
will be continued at least until the warm weather is over.

Sir: 

The United States having guaranteed to the Kaskaskias 
Tribe of Indians a protection against every Indian Tribe or 
Foreign power equal to what is enjoyed by their own Citizens 
and as it appears that there is a design formed by some of the 
neighbouring tribes to cut them off it becomes necessary that 
measures should be immediately taken to pi-event a catas- 
trophe so horrible in itself — and which would justly subject 



 

our government to the reproach of having violated its most 
solemn engagements. 

You are therefore hereby directed to take immediate meas- 
ures to have the militia of the Town of Kaskaskias and its 
vicinity in readiness to repel any attack that may be made 
upon them and in order that your protection should be as 
effectual as possible I have directed the Chief [Ducoigne] to 
put himself and his tribe under your orders and not to suffer 
them to leave the town without your permission — this per- 
mission should not be given unless you should think proper to 
employ them as scouts until it is ascertained that they can 
go out in safety. I have requested Michael Jones Esq. to sup- 
ply them with provisions and ammunition and with this gen- 
tleman to whom I have hitherto entrusted the management of 
the Indian business in the Illinois country you will please to 
consult on the measures to be adopted to carry the Orders 
contained in this letter into effect. It will be necessary that 
every party of Indians who may come into your vicinity should 
be watched and that they should be informed of the direc- 
tions you have received to protect the Kaskaskians and this I 
hope will be sufficient to prevent their attempting to do them 
any farther mischief. I have sent a message [See next num- 
ber] to the Chiefs of the Illinois Kickapoos through the Chief 
of that Nation who resides on the Vermilion and a duplicate 
of the same to Mr. Jones who will convey it to them by some 
intelligent person who understands their language. You will 
please to communicate to me as soon as possible any informa- 
tion you may possess relative to the late murder of the Kas- 
kaskian Indian which will lead to a discovery of the 
perpretrators and whether it proceeded from an accidental 
rencounter or a determination upon the part of the Tribe to 
which they belonged to make War upon the Kaskaskians. 

I am most respectfully your humble servt.

Rangers : 
Ell Ernest is in with your report. Will send you a Cree 
Indian for the one you say is too lazy to hunt. This Indian 



 

has been here for a long time and has the reputation of being 
a great hunter. He can keep your rangers in meat. I have 
had an interview with him and he is delighted with the pros- 
pect of going as a scout. Ernest is acquainted with him and 
can make him understand what is to be done. Ernest said 
that he saw a number of Indians in bathing on the south bank 
of the White river and a number of them were fishing. They 
did not see him. As they were near here, a platoon of cavalry 
has been sent with several scouts to look after them. These 
troops before they return may report to you and will inform 
you what these Indians were up to. There are always some 
contrary people in all walks of life who are hard to manage. 
The ones you report are not all who have been troublesome. 
There is no deviating from the rule. Anyone who refuses to 
stay in the fort when ordered, arrest them and send them to 
this post, under guard. When the Government does all that 
it can to protect its people they must and shall obey the rules. 
This territory is under no law that can force obedience but the 
Military and all of its subjects must obey the governing rule 
or be sent out of it.

Hur. Pa. -20^-206 

Sir: 

I have the Honour to enclose herewith a letter [May 4] 
from Michael Jones, Esquire, the Register of the Land office 
at Kaskaskias, upon the subject of a murder lately committed 
upon one of the Kaskaskias Indians in the vicinity of Kas- 
kaskias by a party of Indians supposed to belong to the Kicka- 
poo or Potawatimi Tribes. From the circumstances attending 
the murder and others which have come to my knowledge I am 
induced to believe that a design has been formed by one or 
both of the last mentioned Tribes to destroy the remnant 
of the Kaskaskias Tribe. As the United States have guaran- 
teed to the Kaskaskians a protection as effectual as "that 
which is enjoyed by their own Citizens" I had no hesitation 
in giving the orders of which the enclosed is a copy to the 



 

Commanding Officer of the Militia at Kaskaskias [Pierre 
Menard]. I hope however that there will be no necessity of 
having recourse to arms to protect them. The message which 
I have sent to the Kickapoos (of which I enclose a copy) will 
I believe produce a suspension of Hostilities and satisfaction 
for the injury that has been already done. The killing of the 
Horse mentioned in that of Mr. Jones' letter and the firing 
at the frenchman do not in my opinion indicate any hostile 
design against the Whites. The Indians frequently steal 
horses that they are unable to catch by shooting them through 
the upper part of the neck, which only stuns them a little — 
but if the shot is a little too low the horse is killed. Doza the 
Frenchman who was shot at he might easily have been mis- 
taken in the night for a Kaskaskias Indian. 

I am utterly at a loss to know what to do with the Banditti 
of Creeks which have so long infested this country. They are 
the most daring mischevious fellows in existence. The set- 
tlers on the Ohio have suffered so much from them, that they 
say They can no longer bear with them. At the earnest 
solicitation of the People in that quarter I have authorized the 
Capt. of the Militia [Pierre Menard] with the concurrance 
of a Justice of the Peace to disarm them, if they do not attend 
to the solemn admonition which I have lately sent them. They 
are in the daily habit of committing every species of aggres- 
sion excepting murder, &c. and should they begin with this 
I know no other way of managing them than hunting them 
like wild beasts. For I am persuaded from their characters 
that if any individual amongst them was to be brought to 
punishment the families of many of our scattered settlers 
would fall a sacrifice to the revenge of the others. 

I have the Honor to be with the greatest respect Sir Your 
humble servt.

Wells to Harrison 

Fort Wayne June 1807 

Dawson, Harrison, 92 

Mr. [William] ' Kirke is now about to retire from this place, 
and form a settlement at the Ottawa towns, among the 
Shawanese, and there wait the orders of the government. 

I have done every thing in my power to carry the views of 
the President into execution among the Indians, under Mr. 
Kirke, but to no purpose. The Indians too plainly see, that he 
cannot fulfil the views of the President, and say they will not 
acknowledge the receipts of a thing they never received. 

Now sir, as I firmly believe that the Indians are very 
anxious to receive what the President has offered them — as 
I am convinced that it would add much to the welfare of the 
Indians, and believing that I could come nearer executing the 
views of the President among the Indians of this agency, than 
any other person he could appoint for that purpose, I now 
offer him my services through you, and beg that you will as- 
sure him that any money that may be appropriated for this 
purpose, will not be misapplied, but will be at all times faith- 
fully and honestly accounted for to his satisfaction. 

I declare to you that I am not actuated by any personal 
views. I do not wish the President to add one cent to my 
salary, unless it is his opinion I deserve it. I am afraid that 
a wrong construction will be put upon the conduct of the In- 
dians in rejecting Mr. Kirke, and discourage the President in 
his benevolent intentions ; and I will exert myself to the utmost 
to forward the views of the President among the Indians of 
this agency, should he think proper to trust them to my care. 
And I trust you will advocate the cause of the Indians on this 
occasion. 

etc. etc. etc. [William Wells] 

1. William Kirke was sent by Baltimore Quakers as a missionai-y to the Wabash 
Indians. Upon a favorable report by him the Quakers petitioned the president for 
aid and received 5G.000. He recruited a small band of assistants and came on to 
Fort Wayne. At a meeting of the chiefs they refused to sanction his work, because 
they said he was a stranger. Harrison implies that agent Wells was the one opposed 
to the missionary. Dawson, Harrison, 01

Captain Wm. Hargrove, In the Ranger Service 

The requisition for provision has been filled and forwarded 
under escort. One of our scouts reports that Indians were 
seen passing to the west on the south side of White river a 
little way west of the place where the Indian trace to Louis- 
ville crosses that river. Whether they are a roving band of 
friendly Indians or hostile ones has not been found out at 
these headquarters. There was a runner sent to David 
Robb's' notifying him about the Indians. When you receive 
this you had better return to this end of your route and leave 
one-half of your men under your ranking non-commissioned 
officer. With the rest you had better examine the country 
to the west on the south side of the river as far as two or 
three miles west of David Robb's place and see if you can 
find the cause of these Indians prowling over that section. If 
the fort at White Oak Springs- is too small to hold the new 
comers, have them build another block house near it and have 
them both enclosed inside the same stockade with only two 
gates for the two forts. If you can enlist of the new arrivals 
as many as twenty-five men for service at this post, your 
effort will be duly appreciated. The time of enlistment of 
quite a number of our troops expires next month and at least 
twenty-five Kentuckians will not re-enlist.

in the state. After the wars he became land agent at Laporte. He died Apr. 15, 1844. 
He was a member of the con. convention of 1816 and a close personal friend of 
Harrison. For a full account see Stormont, Gibson Countu, U

Your repoi't by the hand of Ranger Hogue shows that it is 
best to be determined and firm in dealing with our friends as 
well as foes. You will not have to arrest any more for refus- 
ing to obey the orders for their own protection. Ernest can 
remain two months longer. The service that he was wanted 
for was in a section where he had done scouting service some 
years ago. Mr. David Robb visited the Governor last Satur- 
day the 13th inst. and remained over until Sunday. He says 
that everything is quiet in your home neighborhood. If you 
can make the exchange without weakening your force it would 
be well. Men of families are more liable to yearn for home 
than single ones. Do not make the exchange until the young 
men are at the post of duty. Under no circumstances weaken 
your force, as you have a very important district to guard. 
Computation for rations are paid for as the regular wages of 
the soldier, but not when they are in active service and living 
from supplies furnished by the hunters or by the commis- 
saries. Computation for rations is intended for those who are 
on detached duty and paying for their provisions. The laws 
of the United States govern land warrants or land script and 
each man who serves the required time is entitled to it and 
can claim any land that is surveyed and not allotted on his 
warrant. You are correct when you say that in these trouble- 
some times that soldiers who are serving to protect their 
homes and country are much better troops than those who are 
serving with the hope of securing large pay. This country 
must depend on its soldiers and must pay them but the loyalty 
and patriotism of those enlisted should be well looked after. 
In giving these certificates whose time of enlistment is up, be 
sure to note on their discharge, the amount they have been 
paid and whether they prefer all in land or part in land and 
part in Treasury notes.

Last Saturday, the 4th inst. a number of friendly Indians 
were in to see the celebration of Independence Day. A half- 
breed Delaware Indian named "Swimming Otter" reported 
that there was likely to be a raid made by young Indian

hunters on boats loaded with people and their plunder com- 
ing to this section by the Wabash or going down the Ohio 
river. He said that the band would be led by an Indian who 
lost his father in a battle with a boat crew near the Red 
Banks [Henderson, Ky.]. The scouts thoroughly interrogated 
the Indian and he has promised to let them know the time 
they are to start and the route they will follow. The raiders 
will not get started, so the half-breed says, in less than ten 
days before they go. You will then be informed by a runner 
so that you can thwart their designs if they attempt to cross 
your territory. It is reported here by friendly Indians that 
a band of Miami Indians captured a boat on the Ohio river 
some forty miles below Clarksville and captured the crew, 
killing two men and carrying two women and four children 
into captivity. You can do no better than you have. You 
could not do any good by roaming over the wilderness unless 
it was to make a short cut to reach a point on one of the 
other routes. The white people coming to this section are 
on the three traces [Vincennes, Yellowbanks, Redbanks] or 
down the Ohio and up the Wabash river.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

Vincennes 11th July 1807 

Har. Pa. 207-210 

Sir: 

About five weeks ago I was informed that a Kaskaskias In- 
dian had been killed and scalped a few miles from the Town 
of Kaskaskias and that the murder was supposed to have 
been perpetrated by the Kickapoos. I received also at the 
same time from the chief Ducoigne a demand that the per- 
petrator should be sought after and brought to punishment. 
A few days after a party of Kickapoos who were in the 
neighbourhood of St. Louis waited on Genl. Wm. Clark [Gov- 
ernor of Missouri] acknowledged that the murder had been 
committed by some of their tribe and requested Genl. Clark's 
interference to make up the matter with the Kaskaskias de- 
claring at the same time that the Tribe disavowed any par- 
ticipation in the murder or any wish to do injury to the Kas- 



 

kaskias. Not having then heard of this conciliatory dispo- 
sition on the part of the Kickapoos and believing from cir- 
cumstances which attended the murder that they intended 
further mischief I immediately dispatched a strong speech to 
the chiefs demanding retribution for the past and satisfactory 
assurance of a disposition to maintain peace in future. Their 
answer was sufficiently conciliatory excepting they made no 
mention of any intention to give up the murderer. They 
employed however the Shawanos and Delawares who re- 
sided on the west side of the Mississippi to go to the Kas- 
kaskias with the property which had been taken from the 
murdered Indian and endeavour to settle the affair with Du- 
coign in the Indian way by presents and wampum. Ducoign 
would not agree to their proposals but referred them to me. 
He has however in the speeches he has sent me insisted in 
the strongest terms that the murderer should be delivered 
up and punished and declares that nothing less than his being 
hanged will satisfy him. The Kickapoos will however cer- 
tainly not deliver up murderers be the consequences what they 
may. It is with the utmost reluctance that these surrenders 
are made when white people are killed but I am persuaded 
that no consideration on earth could induce them to do it in 
the case of a murdered Indian it is so contrary to their ideas 
of propriety and to the universal practice of all the tribes on 
the Continent. As Ducoign however insists upon it and the 
right to a protection as effectual as that which is enjoyed by 
our own citizens as guaranteed to him by their treaty the 
attempt to get the murderer must be made. But as his per- 
sisting in having him punished by our Laws will draw down 
upon him the jealousy and hatred of all the other Indians I 
shall endeavour to persuade him to submit to the mediation 
of the neighbouring Tribes and abide their award which be- 
ing made under my superintendence and influence will be as 
favourable to him and his Tribe as any that has been made 
in similar circumstances. 

Mr. Wells informs me that he has made you several com- 
mendations on the subject of the Shawnee Prophet who at- 
tracts so much of the attention of several of the Tribes. I 
really fear that this said Prophet is an engine set to work 
by the British for some bad purpose. A respectable Trader 
lately from Detroit informs me that he was told that [Alex- 
ander] McKee the British Indian Agent was lately seen to 



 

pass up the Miami of the Lake to Greenville where the 
Prophet' resides and where there has been a considerable col- 
lection of Indians for many weeks. The Prophet contrives 
to have every Indian put to death who attempts to open the 
eyes of their unfortunate countrymen and I am told that his 
vengeance has been particularly directed against those whom 
he suspects of an attachment to the United States. Five 
Delaware Chiefs of this Description were lately sent for from 
them under guard. I have serious apprehensions for their 
safety. I have received information which cannot be doubted 
that war belts have been passing through all the Tribes from 
the Gulf of Florida to the Lakes. The Shawnees are the 
bearers of these belts and they have never been our friends. 
The Traders who are attached to our Government are unani- 
mously alarmed and agree on the opinion that a general com- 
bination of the Indians for a war against the United States 
is the object of all these messages and councils. My own 
opinion is that this is certainly the object but I hope and be- 
lieve that it will not be accomplished. The several branches 
of the Miami Tribe are immovable in our interest. The In- 
fluencial chiefs of the Delawares are equally so but if the 
machinations of the Prophet should be successful in getting 
these removed I cannot answer for the fidelity of the rest of 
the Tribe. They have certainly gre'at cause of irritation 
against us in consequence of our being unable to bring to 
justice any one of those miscreants who have murdered their 
people. This is made a handle of by the malcontents amongst 
the other Tribes and has given a very unfavorable opinion 
of our impartiality and justice. The apprehension and pun- 
ishment of [William] Red would at this time be attended with 
the most beneficial consequences. He if taken can be con- 
victed and in my opinion the energy- of the Government ought 
to be excited to apprehend him. Both justice and policy 
strongly demand it. I have offered $300 for him several 
months ago. The sum ought in my opinion to be doubled 
or even trebled. It is true that the offence committed was 

1. The Prophet (Tenskwatawa) was a twin brother of Tecumseh. a shawnee. He 
was born about 1770 and died among his people in Wyandotte, Kans., Nov. 1837. His 
well-known portrait was drawn by George Catlin in 1832. By various ways he had 
established an intertribal reputation as a religious leader. He began his priesthood 
around his home at Greenville about 1805. He had followers among the lake Indians 
beyond Superior and among the Creeks, Osages, and other southern tribes. E. H. Blair,

against the Territorial Laws but as the United States have 
by Treaty Guaranteed the safety of the Indians and the Ter- 
ritory is unable to bring him to justice they could not in my 
opinion employ $600 or $1000 to a better object. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir your humble 
seiM;.

Honble. Henry Dearborn Esq. Secy, of War 

P. S. There is a Mr. Lorimier^ who resides on the Mis- 
sissippi who has great influence over the Delawares and Shaw- 
nees. I have thought of sending a confidential person to him 
to endeavour to ascertain from him the object of the fre- 
quent councils held by these tribes and if he does not know 
to engage him to visit their settlements on the Heads of White 
River and at Greenville for that purpose. I have the honor 
to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 16th of May. 
The $1000 mentioned shall be employed agreeably to your 
directions.

This will be handed you by a Piankashaw Indian who is 
thoroughly reliable. ,He will remain with you until you send 
your next report. The half-bi'eed. Swimming Otter, came in

dians hunters and they will start Tuesday night, aiming to 
cross White river above White Oak Springs [Petersburg] 
and go in a direction that will place them on the Ohio at the 
mouth of Green river. It is hard to determine where they 
will cross the old Indian road that you are on, but some place 
between the mudhole and the White Oak Springs fort. The 
people at that Fort must be advised. You have the authority 
to secure as many men for temporary service from the White 
Oak Spring fort as they can spare. You must have the sec-

There will be thirty mounted men from this Post sent to the 
south of you who will patrol along and near to the Patoka

all this vigilance I feel sure that the Indian band will be de- 
stroyed or turned back.

Your report by the Piankashaw Indian is to hand. The 
service rendered by your scouts is of such value to the coun- 
try that the nation should substantially reward you and your 
commands. The Piankashaw Indian is well acquainted with 
the White river for many miles east of the fork. The chastise- 
ment given this band of robbers and cutthroats will have a 
good effect on them and others who would have followed them 
if they had been successful. The Indian only learns as it is 
shot into him. There will be no more raids from that direc- 
tion this season but it is only safe when we are prepared to 
meet them, if they should attempt to come again. Say to 
young Hogue that the Governor will write him a personal 
letter complimenting him for the good shot he proved to be.

Captain Wm. Hargrove, iii the Ranger Service: 

Your report is to hand. The salt, meal and other supplies 
were sent by cart two days ago. The receipt paper I enclose 
to you. Also fifty pounds of lead, fifty pounds of powder, two 
hundred gun-flints, one bail of tow sent to White Oak Springs 
Fort in care of Woolsey Pride. The ten men you enlisted for 
extra service should have a certificate something like the fol- 
lowing : 

'James Blank served ten days on extra military duty with 
the Rangers under Captain William Hargrove, commanding, 
dated and signed.' 

The rangers on the traveled way to the south need not make 
more than one trip each way every ten days. The danger 
does not exist on that route that did some months ago but 
they will patrol to the east, south of the Patoka river a dis- 
tance of forty miles as the river runs, to a trace that crosses 
that river coming north from the Yellow Banks. There is 
no regular traveled way. John Severn' will guide them over 
a blind trace which runs on a line on which formerly there 
was a chain of small Indian towns running many miles to 
the east. They can go over this route as often as once each 
ten days until further orders. Mr. Severns has been seen 
and will go as soon as you can make the necessary arrange- 
ments. You will want good axemen to mark the traces plain 
by making blazes on the sides of the trees near the road so 
that it can be easily followed without a guide.

was a Welshman who had come with his parents to Va. He served as a soldier in the 
Rev. War. While home on furlough in the Mts. of western Va. the family was sur- 
prised by Indians ; parents and two young children killed. He was a prisoner amons 
the Indians and hunted over the place where he later settled: in 1790 he squatted at

Captain Wm. Hargrove, Commanding Rangers: 

Scout FuQuay with your report is here. This office is well 
pleased to learn that everything is so quiet in your district. 
It often happens that the lull in Indian warfare is only tem- 
porary and that they are preparing to make a much larger 
raid at a point where you don't expect them. Indian war- 
fare as I have learned, after thirty years of experience is 
like no other campaigning. Their approach is so sly and 
stealthy that you can never tell where or when they will come. 
They are the slyest and most treacherous enemy that any 
civilized troops ever had to contend with and the only se- 
curity on the border is continual vigilance. The camp of 
white people that Scout FuQuay found east of the trace to 
the Yellow Bank are no doubt a part of the misguided people 
who have scattered over the country as fugitives from jus- 
tice that had assembled at an island up the Ohio river as 
followers of that arch traitor and murderer, Aaron Burr.' The 
Governor has closely interogated FuQuay and this is his 
opinion. The people are guilty of no more wrong than that 
of being duped by one of the smartest villian in the country. 
They only acted as was dictated to them by those who held 
and had held high positions in the Government. It is broadly 
hinted that a man [Wilkinson] high in military command in 
the American army was strongly tinctured with Burr's chi- 
merical conspiracy that saved himself from disgi-ace by turn- 
ing a traitor to Burr. The thing to do is for you to have 
these four misguided men with their wives and helpless chil- 
dren, prepare a fort some place where you think best in your 
military territory so you can give them your protection. Your 
good judgment is depended upon to keep this matter close 
and so instruct the refugees. FuQuay has been obligated to 
secrecy. These people are no doubt worthy and will grow 
up among the other pioneers and be useful to our country. 
You will find out from them if they know of any other bands 
in hiding. This territory needs more people and these mis- 
guided, duped men and women will make as good citizens as

Sir: 

It is with great pleasure I inform you that the Result of 
several councils held by the Indians in this quarter has been 
an unequivocal and unanimous determination to preserve the 
relations of peace and amity with the U. S. from which they 
derive so much advantage. I pledge myself for the peace- 
able disposition of the Delawares, Miamis, Weas, Eel River 
Tribe, Piankeshaws, Kickapoos and the greater part of the 
Shawanos. Overtures have been made to them both by the 
British and Spaniards which they have rejected with indigna- 
tion. The speech from one of the agents of the latter said 
to be in writing I expect to get possession of. The determina- 
tion of the council held at the Kickapoo town at which the 
above mentioned tribes were represented have been forwarded 
by them to the Indians of the Lakes. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect and consideration 

your humble servant,

Message to the Legislature' 

August 17, 1807 

Western Sun, August 22, 1807 
Dawson, Life of Harrison, 9A-99 

Fellow citize^is of the Legislative Council and Hoiise of Rep- 
resentatives- 
The existence of difficulties in the execution of our revenue 
law, which could not be overcome but by the interposition of 

concerning: the date of this 
ives the date as August 18, 



 

the legislature, has occasioned your convention at an earlier 
period than that which was assigned by the prorogation which 
terminated your last meeting. I regret the inconvenience 
which this measure has probably occasioned to some of you, 
gentlemen, but the public exigencies could not, in my opinion, 
admit of delay, and I was moreover persuaded that you would 
think with me that the calls of official duty were paramount to 
every private or personal consideration. 

I have directed the auditor to lay before you, gentlemen, a 
statement of the causes which have produced the embarrass- 
ments in the collection of the taxes for the present year, which 
will enable you to determine more correctly on the remedy 
that is to be applied. An amendatory act to the one which is 
now in force may answer for the present ; but nothing less, in 
my opinion, than a total change in the whole system will save 
us in future from the disagreeable consequences of a deficient 
revenue and an empty treasury. The defects in the present 
system were early foreseen, and at the opening of the session 
I strongly recommended to the two houses the adoption of a 
diflterent plan. The combination of so many circumstances, 
such as this law requires, must always render the execution 
of it uncertain and precarious. It appears to me, also that it 
is bottomed upon an improper principle; the quantum and 
ratio of the tax should be fixed by the legislator alone, and not 
by an executive officer. This important subject, gentlemen, 
claims your earliest attention; it will require the exercise of 
much industry and patience, to remedy the evils which have 
arisen from the present unfortunate system, and to provide 
one which shall give certainty and stability to your revenue. 
In aflfairs of this kind, experience is the best guide which the 
legislator can follow — he will seek out cases that are parallel 
to the one on which he is called to act, and will thus possess 
himself of sure landmarks to guide him to his object. In the 
present instance there is no necessity of a recurrence to for- 
eign or distant examples, the neighboring states affording pre- 

it as August 17. Apparently it was dated on the 17th, but not delivered till twelve 
o'clock on the 18th when the governor met both houses of the legislature in the repre- 
sentative chamber. The laws of 1807 bear the date August 16, Sunday. 

2. The Second General Assembly was composed of Jesse B. Thomas of Dearborn, 
Shadrach Bond and William Biggs of St. Clair (111.), George Fisher of Randolph (111.), 
James Beggs of Clark and Luke Decker and General W. Johnston of Knox. These 
were elected on the first Monday of Feb. 1807. The councillors were as before, except 
that Shadrach Bond took the place of John Hay. resigned. When Bond was elected 
B representative, Shadrach Bond, Jr., took his place. (See page 1.) 



 

cisely what we seek — a people similar in manners, in habits, 
and in the state of information, raising their revenue from the 
same objects. Notwithstanding the embarrassments which 
have hitherto attended our financial operations, gentlemen, 
there is one consolatory circumstance, which has been fully 
established, that a revenue equal to all our necessities can be 
raised, and that too without oppression or inconvenience to the 
people. 

The organization of the inferior courts, which was adopted 
at the first session, continues as far as I am informed to pro- 
duce all the good effects which was expected to flow from it. 

No session of the court of chancery has yet been holden; 
whether the blame is attributable to the chancellor, or to the 
legislature in not providing him a compensation, I shall not 
attempt to determine ; it is, however, a state of things which 
cannot but produce great inconvenience and distress to the 
suitors in that court, and a speedy remedy ought certainly to 
be applied. If in the review, gentlemen, which you shall take 
of the other parts of the judiciary system, it should appear 
susceptible of improvement in the important points of facili- 
tating the operations of justice and lessing the burdens to its 
attainment, the adoption of it would, no doubt, be grateful to 
your constituents. 

The law which was passed at the last session of the legis- 
lature for regulating marriages does not authorize the clerks 
who issue the licenses to demand security of the applicants 
that there exists no lawful impediment to the proposed union. 
This omission, which I suppose was accidental, occasions a 
very glaring inconsistency in our code. Conforming to the 
practice in most of the United states, our laws consider and 
punish bigamy as a capital off'ense. The facility with which 
licenses may be procured, and the want of authority in the per- 
son who issues them to ask a single question of the applicants, 
seems to invite to the commission of an off'ense which is 
deemed sufficiently heinous to merit the punishment of death. 
It is certainly better, when it is practicable, to prevent crimes 
by regulations which the unprincipled and wicked cannot 
evade, than by the infliction of punishment. An amendment 
to the law in question, which should direct the applicants for 
licenses to give bond and security in a small amount of their 
legal ability to marry, would probably save many unsuspect- 
ing females from being made the victims of their credulity. 



 

Connected in some measure with this subject is the law- 
authorizing the general and circuit courts to grant divorces. 
The propriety and policy of a law of this kind has been 
strongly contested in many parts of the United States ; and it 
is believed that the principle has been everywhere condemned 
save in one or two States only. It cannot be denied, that the 
success of one applicant for a divorce has always the effect of 
producing others, and that the advantages which a few indi- 
viduals may derive from the dissolution of this solemn con- 
tract are too dearly purchased by its injurious effects upon 
the morals of the community. The scenes which are fre- 
quently exhibited in trials of this kind are shocking to human- 
ity: the ties of consanguinity and nature are loosened; the 
child is brought to give testimony against the parents; con- 
fidence and affection are destroyed; family secrets disclosed; 
and human nature is exhibited in its worst colors. In the 
time of the Roman republic divorces might be obtained by a 
summary and easy process, but so great was the abhorrence 
of them amongst these enlightened people that, in a period 
of five hundred years, but one person had been found to take 
advantage of the privilege which the law allowed. But when 
their manners became corrupted by luxury, divorces were so 
common that applications were frequently made to the College 
of Augurs to ascertain the father of a child born in legal wed- 
lock. A few years ago there were but two instances on rec- 
ord in the State of Virginia of applications for divorces. One 
only of these had been successful ; and although that was ac- 
knowledged to be a case which had as strong claims to indul- 
gence as any that could happen, it was nevertheless opposed 
by some of the most enlightened patriots of the State, upon 
the principle that it was better for an individual to suffer some 
inconvenience than that an example should be established so 
injurious (as they supposed) to the morals of the community. 
There ought certainly, however, to be some tribunal for grant- 
ing divorces; but I am decidedly of opinion that this power 
can nowhere be so properly lodged as with the legislature. 

The perfection of the militia system, gentlemen, is an object 
of the first importance. To render it an efficient and compe- 
tent protection to our country in time of war, it is requisite 
that its organization and discipline should be attended to in 
time of peace. I fear, however, that our progress in these es- 
sential points will fall far short of the public expectations and 



 

my wishes, unless the state of our treasury will authorize the 
disbursement of a small sum as a compensation for a staff 
officer in each county to attend to the disciplining the men and 
regulating the returns. It gives me pleasure to state that 
some degree of military spirit begins to manifest itself in sev- 
eral parts of the territory, and that there is a probability that 
we shall at least furnish our quota of volunteers, to serve upon 
the terms of a late act of Congress. The deficiency of arms 
and accoutrements throughout every corps of the militia, is 
however truly alarming and disgraceful. Men in easy cir- 
cumstances are not ashamed to appear upon the parade with- 
out a firelock, or bearing one which would be more harmless 
to an enemy than the sticks carried by others. Whilst we 
should pity and endeavor from the public purse to furnish 
those who are unable to supply themselves, those who are able, 
and neglect to equip themselves, should be denied the honor- 
able appellation of defenders of their country. One of the 
principal characteristics which distinguishes the citizens of a 
free government from the subjects of a despotic one is the 
right of keeping arms ; and that any American should neglect 
to avail himself of this valuable privilege manifests a supine- 
ness which is highly censurable. It is possible, gentlemen, 
that the moment is not far distant when every capable man 
will be called upon to assume the character of a soldier. The 
situation of our affairs on the Atlantic coast, as well as on this 
frontier, makes it necessary that there should be no delay in 
preparing ourselves for the worst that may happen. A rest- 
less and dissatisfied disposition has manifested itself among 
some of the neighboring tribes, and a few individuals are 
believed to be decidedly hostile. It gives me pleasure, how- 
ever, to state that I have within a few days received from two 
of the tribes the most positive assurances of friendship and 
their unalterable determination to submit themselves entirely 
to my direction. These assurances, although in my opinion 
sincere, ought not entirely to be relied upon; and the prepara- 
tions ought still for defense to go on until the real disposition 
of all the tribes is perfectly ascertained. Although [that] the 
agency of a foreign power is producing the discontents among 
the Indians cannot be questioned, I am persuaded that their 
utmost efforts to induce them to take up arms would be un- 
availing, if one only of the many persons who have committed 
murder on their people could be brought to punishment. 



 

Whilst we rigorously exact of them the delivery of every 
murderer of a white man, the neglect on our part to punish 
similar offences committed on them forms a strong and just 
ground of complaint, for which I can offer no excuse or palia- 
tion. A powerful nation rendering justice to a petty tribe of 
savages is a sublime spectacle, worthy of a great republic, 
and of a people who have shewn themselves as valiant in war 
as in peace moderate and forbearing. I do not know, gentle- 
men, whether it will be in your power to remedy the evil com- 
plained of, as the defects seems to be not so much in the 
laws as in the execution. But if any means can be adopted 
which would insure the execution of justice in any cases in 
which the Indians are concerned, the measure would reflect 
honor on yourselves, and be of undoubted advantage to your 
country. 

The sale of the public lands in the district of Vincennes 
since the last session of the legislature, and the preparations 
for opening other land offices, gives us a nearer prospect of 
the accomplishment of our hopes and wishes, by the forma- 
tion of a State government. An event of so much importance 
to the prosperity and character of the country ought to be 
accelerated by every means within our reach. 

I should not do justice to my own feelings, and perhaps 
disappoint your expectations, gentlemen, should I neglect on 
this occasion to mention a subject which has greatly agitated 
our country, and called forth the warmest expressions of 
patriotic ardour from every class of its citizens. The United 
States, true to those principles which ought to prevail in every 
republic, preferring happiness to splendor, and safety to glory, 
have endeavored to abstract themselves from the entangling 
politics of Europe, and by practicing the most perfect neutral- 
ity to keep clear of those bloody wars which have so long 
desolated the finest quarter of the globe! The justice and im- 
partiality of her conduct towards the belligerents has not, 
however, been reciprocated, and from one of those powers 
insult and injury have followed each other in quick succession, 
and promised satisfaction been anticipated by further out- 
rage ! The ships of our merchants pursuing a legal commerce 
upon that ocean to which all have an equal right, have been 
captured, plundered, and their men impressed to serve a for- 
eign tyrant, and shed their blood in battles in which they 
have no interest. For these aggressions our government. 



 

without mingling with its pohtics those passions which agi- 
tate the breasts of monarchs, and which produce the greater 
part of those wars which overwhelm their unhappy subjects 
with misery and ruin, have demanded redress but have de- 
manded it in vain, still calculating, however, upon the exist- 
ence of a better disposition on the part of the power which 
had injured us. That last resort, which is literally "a trial 
of who can do the other the most harm", was deprecated by 
the people as well as by the government and as long as there 
remained the most distant hope of an amicable adjustment 
argument and negotiation were thought preferable to war. 
This delusion has, however, passed away, and has given place 
to the opinion that moderation and forbearance have been mis- 
taken for timidity and fear. Some nations, like some indi- 
viduals will not profit by the lessons of experience. Great 
Britain might have remembered that the arms of America 
were not palsied by the previous use of remonstrance. A 
blind fatality hurries her on to that destruction which Amer- 
ica had no wish to accelerate ; and an act of tyranny and in- 
justice, surpassing anything that can be found even in the 
history of her depredations upon neutrals, has converted an 
useful friend to a foe, able to punish her for her multiplied 
agressions.'' 

The blood rises to my cheek when I reflect on the humiliat- 
ing, the disgraceful scene, of the crew of an American ship of 
war mustered on its own deck by a British lieutenant for the 
purpose of selecting the innocent victims of their own 
tyranny! But an act of this kind was perhaps necessary to 
convince all our fellow-citizens that they had nothing to ex- 
pect from British generosity or justice, when these were op- 
posed by British interest. The unheard of outrage has made 
a deep impression upon the American mind ; citizens of every 
political denomination are rallying round the standard of their 
country, and pledging their lives and fortunes in support of 
her rights.^ I should do injustice to the well-known patri- 
otism of our territory to suppose that either yourselves or your 
constituents, gentlemen, felt less on this interesting occasion 
than the rest of your countrymen. We are, indeed, from our

situation, peculiarly interested in the contest whicli is likely to 
ensue ; for who does not know that the tomahawk and scalping 
knife of the savage are always employed as the instruments 
of British vengeance. At this moment, fellow citizens, as I 
sincerely believe, their agents are organizing a combination 
amongst the Indians within our limits, for the purposes of 
assassination and murder ; and if these their worthy allies are 
not let loose to slaughter our women and children, it will not 
proceed from the humanity and mercy of a nation which 
boasts of her attainments in every art and science. 

At this important crisis but one sentiment should animate 
the breasts of every American. Disregarding every personal 
consideration, he should think only of the tie that binds him 
to his country; and confiding in the wisdom and firmness of 
his government, he should patiently wait the signal which 
calls him to the field. How deep the humiliation ! How last- 
ing the disgrace! How injurious to the cause of republican- 
ism, should the blood of our murdered fellow citizens remain 
unsatisfied, or unrevenged! But it cannot be; Americans 
must prize too highly their dear-bought rights, tamely to sur- 
render them to the proud nation from whom they were 
wrested. A beneficent and discriminating Providence will 
make us the objects of his peculiar care ; another Washington 
will arise to lead our armies to victory and glory, and the 
tyrants of the world will be taught the useful lesson that a 
nation of Free men are not to be insulted with impunity.

Reply of the Legislature to the Message 

St. Vincent, August 19, 1807 

Dawson, Harrison, 99 

His Excellency, William Henry Harrison, Governor of the 
Indiana Territory: 

Accept, sir, the merited thanks of the house of representa- 
tives, for the speech which you delivered to the two branches 
of the legislature, on the 18th instant, in which we discover 
nothing more than those true and independent principles 
which compose the patriotic heart. 

The subjects which you have taken notice of in your speech, 
the injurious consequences resulting from them, and the im- 



 

propriety of their continuance, are, we are assured from ex- 
perience, far from being chimerical. 

We have seen, sir, and, with you, regret, the insufficiency of 
our militia system; and, by every constitutional exertion in 
our power, will endeavor to avert the great calamity of im- 
mediately falling a sure prey to any and every savage or 
dastardly foe; which would surely and inevitably be the case 
under our present military or defensive arrangements. 

The recent lawless and piratical conduct of some of the 
officers of the British navy, upon one of the United States' 
vessels, riding at anchor in the waters of peace, and near the 
shoi-es of honest content, and she, too in an unprepared state 
of defence, harrows up our very souls, and fires our just 
indignation. We are assured that nothing but unpunished 
example dared them to the commission of a deed so unwar- 
rantable, base, and truly despicable; highly honorary and 
imitative of the nation and government under which they 
serve. Suffer us, sir, to assure you, that but one sentiment 
animates the representatives of the sons of Indiana, who es- 
teem themselves heirs to freedom; and until the last drop of 
blood shall be drained from our hearts, we will defend our- 
selves, our rising posterity, and the freedom of America. 

With equal pleasure with yourself, we view our progressive 
population, which is, as it were the key stone of that desirable 
arch, (we mean a free and independent state,) in the com- 
pletion of which alone, we will ever be useful or ornamental 
to our general government. And we most ardently pray that 
our superstructure may have the three necessary and inesti- 
mable qualities of beauty, strength, and wisdom, which will 
secure us our true standing amongst the states of the Union. 

It is with heartfelt pleasure and real satisfaction, that we 
unanimously acknowledge, sir, our firm belief that we shall 
receive your co-operation in any measures that may be deemed 
for the general good.

Captain William Hargrove, Commanding Scouts and 
Rangers : 
Your report by the Crea Indian. He was detailed here to 
carry you this letter of instruction. The four young men' you 
sent with him have enlisted and look like good material to 
make soldiers. The Governor is well pleased with your suc- 
cess in having the four families located in your district. The 
young men you sent were interrogated separately. They all 
agree in their statements that there are several other bands 
scattered over the territory some distance north of the Ohio 
river from ten to fifteen miles east of the yellow bank trace 
to something like the same distance west of the same trace. 
They claim that there is one band of these refugees west of 
the Yellow Bank trace about ten miles. They were camped 
near a large creek. It is thought best for you to send FuQuay 
with two other men to find these people and have them locate 
in a place that they can be given protection and that they 
can aid in giving protection to others. Young Bailey, one 
of the men you sent in some time ago has orders to report 
to you to go with FuQuay. He is acquainted with the people 
and has been at their camp. He says that there are six men, 
three women and five children in the band. Instruct FuQuay 
to infoi-m the refugees that they must move near some of 
the settled sections and build a block house for their pro- 
tection and there will be no question asked. That as soon 
as the dangerous season for Indian raids has passed, they 
can go to work preparing homes. If you can enlist the men 
without families, do so. If you don't need them send them 
to this Post. If these people should refuse to settle as has 
been suggested, after you have plainly informed them it 
must be done, then you send such a number of men as will 
be required to arrest and bring them and their belongings to 
this Post. The wounded old soldier and his family you can 
put in charge of one of your stockade camps. The man to 
look well for Indians that may be prowling around, the woman 
to oversee the culinary affairs of the camp.

HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 239 

John Severns was here today and had an interview with the 
Governor about opening a trace from the one that runs south 
from your neighborhood to the Red Banks, to commence fif- 
teen miles north of the Ohio river on that trace, running 
thence east parallel with the river from forty to fifty miles. 
If it should become necessary to reinforce the Rangers on 
either of the traces running to the south or the main one 
running to the east, it would be almost impossible to do it 
as the country between the traces is one vast unbroken wil- 
derness. Severns says that many large creeks will have to 
be crossed that empty their waters into the Ohio. The trace 
just south of the Patoka river opened some time ago, will 
be extended from the Yellow Banks trace, thirty or forty 
miles east. You had better have the same men go over this 
route as soon as Severns is through with the new survey far- 
ther south. Mr. Severns says that in going near the Patoka 
river many abrupt banks and deep gorges are met with. In- 
form him that it is not necessary to make a straight line but 
to so blaze and mark it that it can be easily traced. It is 
not intended for wheeled vehicles or sleds to pass over but 
for foot soldiers mostly. The logs need not be moved but 
the brush had better be cut seven or eight feet wide.

Wells to Harrison 

Fort Wayne, the 20th August 1807 

Hu.r. Pa. 1 89-191 

Dear Sir: 

Since I wrote you on the 14 instant the Indians have con- 
tinued to flock to Greenville which increases the fears of our 
frontiers. These Indians are from the Lakes near Mackinac 
they appear to be deff to everything I say to them tho I can 
see nothing among them that carrys the appearance of Dan- 
ger. 

Two confidential Indians that I sent to that quarter have 
returned today and say that all the Indians in that quarter 
believe in what the Prophet tells them which is that the great 
spirit will in a few years distroy every white man in america 
that every Indian has made himself a war club that the militia 



 

and military at Mackanak are constantly under arms and that 
they could here no friendship expressed among the Indians 
for the United States. I am also this moment informed by 
a letter from Detroit that the inhabitants of that place are 
fortifing themselves. 

It appears by information I this moment received that up- 
wards of 200 Delawares have gone to meet the other Indians 
at the Kickapoo tov^^n in the prairie where it is expected 13 
different nations will be represented. 

The Delawares have received this invitation from the Mi- 
amis at Massacinwa to attend this council. Since Rusherville 
[Richardville] returaed from Detroit all the Miamis have re- 
fused to attend this counsel 3 excepted. Rusherville,' Pecan 
and the Owl it is believed will be at this place to mori'ow to 
receive their goods and to cover their designs in assembling 
the Indians at the Kickapoo towns— none of the Pawtawata- 
mys from this quarter have gone to this council. This busi- 
ness as I before told you was kept a secret from the Little 
Turtle^ the mesenger sent from Massacenwa to the Delawares 

1. Richardville was a Miami chief born near Furt Wayne about 1761. His father 
was the Indian trader Druet de Richardville and his mother an Indian named Taucumwa. 
This Indian family had a monopoly of the transportation business between the Maumee 
and Wabash and was wealthy. John Baptist Richardville or Peshewa was her only 
son. He succeeded to the leadership of the tribe after the death of Pecan in 1814. 
He died in 1841. He is thought to have been a nephew of Little Turtle. Brice, 
Fort Wayne. M. tM. 2Sr,, 31i; Burton. Hist. Col. 66 

2. Little Turtle. "Misch-e-can-o-quoh," or the Little Turtle, agreeably to the best 
received authorities, was of a mi.xed origin — his mother beinp a Mohegan woman and 
his father a Miami chief — born about the year 1747, at the latter's village on the 
upper waters of Eel river, some twenty miles west of Ft. Wayne. He planned and 
won decisive victories in the two engagements against detachments of Gen. Harmar's 
army, near Ft. Wayne, in October. 1790: was conspicuous as the leader in the attack, 
on the morning of November 4. 1791, upon the forces of Gov. St. Clair, that resulted 
in the terrible disaster known in history as "St. Clair's Defeat", and which was 
without a parallel in Indian warfare until the disastrous ertgagment of Gen. Custer, 
on the Little Big-Horn River of the Upper Missouri. He was also in the action of 
June 30. 1794, in the severe attack upon Major McMahon's escort of ninety riflemen 
and fifty dragoons, under the walls of "Fort Recovei-y". a militai-y post erected in 
December, 1793, upon the ground where St. Clair had been defeated. Satisfied that 
the Indian confederation could not successfully contend with Gen. Wayne, he advised 
them to listen to the latter's overtures for peace. Overruled in this, he led his own 
warriors in the battle of August 20. 1794. known as the "Battle of the Fallen Timbers", 
in which Gen. Wayne achieved a decisive victory. From this time forward, the Little 
Turtle was the open and abiding friend of the United States. He would before this 
have broken away from the malign influence operating from Canada through its 
agents and traders, but he was powerless to carry his people with him until after 
they had suffered serious reverses. 

At the Treaty of Greenville, he shone as the brightest light in the assembled orators, 
gathered at this great council-fire from the entire Northwest, to plead the cause of 
their tribes and of their starving women and children. After the conclusion of peace. 
Little Turtle resided at his village, where the Government had built him a comfortable 
house. "He took," says Gov. Harrison, "great interest in everything that appertained 



 

in delivering his message said he was directed to tell them 
(the Delawares) that this Business must be kept a secret 
from the Turtle, the White Loon,- 5 Medals* and Charley=^ as 
they weai-e Big Knives — and ought not to know anything 
about the affairs of the Indians. I believe the Pawtawatamys, 

to civilized life, and possessed a mind capable of understanding their advantages in a 
degree far superior to any other Indian." In his character he combined, in an eminent 
degree, the qualities of the military strategist, the wily diplomat, the orator, and the 
philospher, winning distinction in all. 

He died of gout, July 14, 1812, on the side of the St. Marys river, opposite Ft. 
Wayne, in the orchard of his son-in-law Capt. Wm. Wells, from whose house, at his 
own request, he had been removed to the open air. He was buried upon the spot with 
military honors, by the troops of the garrison, and with his remains were deposited 
the sword and large silver medal presented by President Washington, and his other 
war implements and ornaments." Brice's Fort Wayne; Harrison, The Aborigines of the 
Ohio valley, 70 

3. White Loon or Wapa Mangua a Miami chief. His village was on the Mississinewa 
near Marion. His town was burned by Campbell Dec. 14, 1812. Harrison had met him 
at Greenville and was personally acquainted with him and considered him friendly to 
the Americans.

Fergus, Hist. Ser. 26, p. 73 
4. "Five Medals or Waugshe was a celebrated war-chief of the river St. Joseph of 
Lake Michigan, whose village was upon the Elkhart tributary of that stream, in north- 
ern Indiana. He is recognized under various names, viz, ; at the treaty of Greenville 
as "Wau-gshe" — from "Wau-gese", the Odjibwa name for a favorite silver ornament in 
the shape of and called a Half-Moon : at the second treaty of peace executed at Green- 
ville, July 22, 1814, he is written down as "0-nox-a, or Five Medals": while, at the 
treaty of Spring Wells, near Detroit, in 181.5, his name is affixed to the parchment as 
"Noun-geesia, or Five Medals." The two are synonymous, the first being compounded 
from "Noun", Five, and "Gee-sia", medals or ornaments, in the Pottawatomie dialect, 
allowing for a somewhat defective spelling that fails to fully preserve the sound of 
the word as the Indian would pronounce it. He wore upon his person medals presented 
to him by both British and American authorities, with other ornaments, from which 
he came to be designated as "The Five Medals." 

Harrison, Discourse of Aboriffines, 73 

5. Charley or Katunga. A chief of that subdivision of the Miamis who were called 
Eel-Rivers (and Eel-Creeks), for reason that their ancient and principal village— known 
by the Indians as Ke-na-pa-com-a-qua, to the early French writers as L'Anguille (the 
Eel), and to the Americans as the "Eel River Town" was situated on this stream, 
some six miles above its confluence with the Wabash at Logansport, Ind. However, 
it is evident, from Gov. Harrison's instructions to Col. Campbell, already referred to, 
that Charley lived in one of the villages on the Mississinnewa which Col, Compbell was 
ordered to destroy : for among those whose lives were to be saved is named that of 
"Charley, the principal of the Eel River Tribe." The chief figures at several of the 
treaties, on behalf of his tribe, both before and after the war of 1812, as "Ka-Tun-ga" 
"Ke-tan-ga" (with the addition of "Charley") ; and, in some instances, as simply 
Charley. His original name — the signiiication of which is nowhere given — is neither 
Indian, French, or English, but savors of the cori-uption of all. 

His people were swept over to the British by the current of events immediately 
following Gen. Hull's surrender of Detroit, and which carried with it nearly all the 
other Northwestern tribes. The failure of the attack upon Fort Harrison, near Terre 
Haute, Ind., September 4. 1812, and upon Fort Wayne early in this month, together 
with the energy Gov. Harrison displayed in organizing the militia of Indiana, Ohio, 
and Kentucky, all ablaze with enthusiasm, to recover the prestige and territory lost 
by the unexplainable conduct of Gen. Hull at Detroit thoroughly alai-med those of 
the Miamis who had taken sides with Te-cum-the and the British. Accordingly we 
learn, from an official letter of Gov. Harrison, dated Franklinton, O., October 13, 1812, 

16—21182 



 

miamis and Delawares are our friends. Lapasin" is to be 
suspected — the prophet keeps up a communication with the 
British at Maiden. We are all allarmed at this place, my 
self excepted as I can see no danger as yet at our doors. 

Something must be done it cannot be done too soon for the 
Indians are certainly forming an improper combination one 
that it is not friendly towards us otherwise the Leaders in 
it would not keep it so much in the Dark from every person 
that is friendly disposed towards the united States. I have 
sent Mr. [John] Connor with this letter to you in order that 
you may receive all the information he possesses respecting 
the Delawares. 

I have promised him that you would reward him liberally 
for his trouble — treat him well He may be usefull to us. 

I shall do everything for the best and hope to secure such 
instructions from you as may be calculated to meet the pres- 
ent times as soon as possible. 

It is my opinion that the British are at the bottom of all 
this Business and depend on it that if we have war with them 
that many of the Indian tribes will take an active part against 
us — and nothing would have a better effect on the minds of 
the Indians than an immediate show of resentment on our 

that: "Before I left St. Mary's for Defiance, some Miamis had arrived, via Fort 
Wayne, with a flag and a message from their chiefs, begging for peace. I had no 
time then to listen to their speech, and on my return here I found the Owl, (a dis- 
tinguished chief, who had long been a confidential friend of the Governor) Charley, 
the Eel-River Chief, the Turtle's son, and several others who had joined them. They 
came prepared to palliate or deny the hostility of their tribe, as. one or the other might 
best suit their purpose." 

Charley survived the war, and was living as late as October 6, 1818, when he, with 
other "chiefs and warriors of the Miami nation of Indians", executed the Treaty of St. 
Mary's ; and he was dead before October 23, 1826, when, at the treaty held at the 
mouth of Mississinewa, a reservation of "five sections of land, above the old village on 
the north side of Eel River." was made in favor of his son "Little Charley".

6. LePousser (French), A-she-non-qua in the Miami dialect, signifying the Speech 
Maker, the Persuader, or Talker. At the treaty held October 26. 1809, at Vincennes, 
this chief's name is signed Lapousier (the article La and the word Pousser run together 
as in the Ft. Wayne manuscript), while at the "Treaty of Peace and Friendship," 
between the U. S. and the Miamis and other hostile tribes in the War of 1812, e.\ecuted 
at Greenville, Ohio, July 22. 1814, his name appears thus, "Lapassiere or A-she-non-qua."

text of the Treaty is supplemented with the signers' names interpreted and carefully 
spaced so as to preserve the correct sound in their pronunciation. 

The Weas, for whom A-she-non-qua was a leading orator, were a band of the 
Miami tribe having their principal village on the east bank of the Wabash, below 
Lafayette, and above Attica, and known in early history as Ouiatanon, or the Wea-town. 
The name is yet preserved, and the identity of the neighborhood retained, in its 
bestowal upon "Wea-Prairie" and "Wea-creek."

from Greenville and I doubt whether matters can be kept in 
there present state until I have time to hear from you. The

Sir: 

Since my last I have made every exertion to ascertain the 
real disposition of the neighbouring Tribes and the cause of 
the stir and commotion which have existed amongst them 
for some time past. The avowed object of the latter is to 
cement a more perfect union and friendship amongst them- 
selves as they have often been advised to the United States 
but to which I am persuaded they were stimulated in the 
present instance by British influence. I am confident how- 
ever that the ultimate object of the British (which no doubt 
is that of forming a general confederacy against us) has not 
yet been communicated either to the Miamis, Weas, Dela- 
wares or even to the Kickapoos. The Shawnees are certainly 
entirely devoted to the British as are a part of the Pota- 
watomies, the Chippeways and Ottawas. From the enclosed 
deposition of [Dominique] Ducharme' sent to me by Mr. 
Jouitt it would appear that the latter tribes have actually

determined on commencing hostilities. I have adopted meas- 
ures which I think cannot fail to put me in possession of the 
intentions of the British in this quarter, at least as far as 
they are known to the Indians. As soon as my emissary 
returns you shall be informed of everything he may be able 
to discover. I am in the meantime doing all in my power to 
organize and discipline the Militia of the Territory. As it 
is almost impossible to find persons who are acquainted even 
with the rudiments of tactics, I am obliged to perform alter- 
nately the duties of Commander-in-chief Adjutant and even 
drill corporal. The habits of my early life are not however 
so far obliterated as to make this duty irksome or unpleas- 
ant, were it not for the great deficiency of ai-ms and accou- 
trements. We have cavalry without swords, light infantry 
without bayonets or cartridge boxes and battalions armed 
with a mixture of rifles, fowling pieces, broken muskets and 
sticks. To a man accustomed to the uniformity of a regular 
and disciplined army, these things are really shocking. I 
must beg of you sir to submit to the President the propriety 
of having our deficiency made up from the publick arsenals. 
A small deposit of arms might be made with good effect at 
this place, at Kaskaskia or Cahokia, and Jeffersonville. The 
Militia of Dearborn county, the seat of Justice of which is 
not more than 18 miles from the Arsenal at New-Port, might, 
in case of emergency be supplied from there. 

I have not been able to collect the returns from the distant 
counties of the volunteers who have off"ered on the terms of 
the late act of Congress. I am in hopes to be able to forward 
them to you in the course of a fortnight. Two troops of 
cavalry one of light infantry, one or two of expert riflemen, 
and two or three others to be armed with rifles or muskets 
as the President may chose, may I think be calculated on. 

I am extremely anxious to know the President's determina- 
tion on the subject of a supply of arms etc. If he should 
direct them to be supplied, on order to Major [Thomas] Mar- 
tin- to send them on immediately to the places above desig- 
nated would enable us to get them much sooner than if the 
order were in the first instance sent to me.

William Hargrove, Commanding first division of Rangers, 
east of the Wabash river: 
There has been a trace cut from the Clarksville and Vin- 
cennes road that leaves that route at a point about forty 
miles east of the Mudhole and running to the south, coming 
to the Ohio river at the west end of a large bend about three 
miles west of the mouth of Blue river [Fredonia]. There is 
a traveled way that comes to the south bank of the Ohio 
opposite this point that runs to the south and far into Ken- 
tucky and people coming to this and other sections of In- 
diana Territory are crossing the river at that point and fol- 
lowing Blue river to the old Indian road before mentioned. 
The two traces to the east which are now being opened should 
go into this Blue river trace. You are instructed to have a 
patrol of three men go over the new rou^te nearest the Ohio

Harrison to Secretary of War 

Vincennes Sept. 5th 1807 

Har. Pa. 186-188 

Sir: 

The letter herewith enclosed [August 20, above] from Mr. 
Wells I received four days ago, and I at first thought it of 
sufficient Importance to authorise my sending it by a special 
Express but upon conversing with Mr. [John] Connor the 
Bearer of it It appeared to me that there was no danger of 
hostilities being immediately commenced altho I do Believe 
that the Chippeways, Ottowas and part of the Pottawatamies 
only wait for the signal from the British Indian Agents, to 
commence the attack. 

I have sent Connor with a Talk [immediately following] 
to the Shawnese requiring the Immediate removal of the Im- 
postor from our Territory and the dispersion of the War- 



 

riors he has collected around him. The British could not 
have adopted a better plan to effect their purpose of alienating 
from our government the affections of the Indians than em- 
ploying this vile Instrument. It manifests at once their in- 
veterate rancour against us and their perfect acquaintance 
with the Indian character. I think however that the Miamies, 
Weas, Delawares and Kickapoos have not as yet been seduced 
and that we may rely on their fidelity. I believe their in- 
clinations are on our side but if that were not even the case 
I am persuaded that they are too well acquainted with their 
Interest to dare to lift the Tomahawk. 

Wells has been endeavouring for some time past to get the 
Impostor removed from Greenville by means of the Delawares 
and Shawnese but without effect ; he has also I Believe threat- 
ened him with the vengeance of the United States, if he con- 
tinues to Excite disturbances amongst the Indians. To pro- 
tect himself from this is I imagine the reason of his retain- 
ing about him the armed pilgrims that have come from the 
Lakes to visit him. Connor says that 12 or 15 days ago they 
amounted to upwards of Three hundred Men, and that a 
larger body were hourly Expected. It would require a con- 
siderable force to remove those Fellows, and it is my opinion, 
it should not be attempted, but with one that would leave 
nothing to the hazard. Filled with the enthusiasm as those 
wretches certainly are, they would no doubt defend the object 
of their veneration with all their force and an unsuccessful 
attempt to drive them off would confirm his influence and per- 
haps draw over to his party those tribes who now regard 
him with contempt. Believing that it was all important in 
the present crisis to obtain Correct information from the In- 
dian country and to secure the friendship of those who are 
best calculated to give it I have appointed Mr. Connor Inter- 
preter for the Delawares with the same pay as that Mr. 
[Joseph] Barron receives and have directed him to employ 
himself altogether in developing the designs of the British 
and such of the Indians as they have gained over to their 
interest. I have entire reliance on his fidelity, and am con- 
fident that he can do us much service. I have placed myself 
under no obligation to Continue him longer than his services 
will be wanted. I trust that this step will meet the Presi- 
dent's approbation. 

Since I had the honour to write to you on Saturday last 



 

two other companies of Volunteers Consisting of young active 
Woodsmen have oifered their services. This County alone 
will furnish a good Battalion from the other Counties there 
will be at least a sufficiency to form a Regiment or rather a 
Legionary Corps composed of Dragoons, Riflemen, and in- 
fantry. 

I have the honor to be with perfect respect your most obedi- 
ent and humble servant.

August, 1807 

Dawson, Hariison, 101 

My Children: 

Listen to me, I speak in the name of your father, the great 
chief of the Seventeen Fires. 

My Children, it is now twelve years since the tomahawk, 
which you had raised by the advice of your father the king 
of Great Britain, was buried at Greenville in the presence 
of that great warrior. General Wayne. 

My Children, you there promised, and the Great Spirit 
heard it, that you would in future live in peace and friend- 
ship with your brothers, the Americans. You made a treaty 
with your father, and that contained a number of good things, 
equally beneficial to all the tribes of red people, who were 
parties to it. 

My Children, you promised in that treaty to acknowledge 
no other father than the chief of the Seventeen Fires, and 
never to listen to the proposition of any foreign nation. You 
promised never to lift up the tomahawk against any of your 
father's children, and to give him notice of any other tribe 
that intended it: your father also promised to do something 
for you, particularly to deliver to you every year a certain 
quantity of goods, to prevent any white man from settling 
upon your lands without your consent, or to do you any per- 
sonal injury. He promised to run a line between your land 
£^nd his, so that you might know your own ; and you were to 



 

be permitted to live and hunt upon your father's lands, as 
long as you behaved yourselves well. 

Ahj Children, which of those articles has your father 
broken? You know that he has observed them all with the 
utmost good faith. But, my Children, have you done so? 
Have you not always had your ears open to receive bad ad- 
vice from the white people beyond the lakes? 

My Children, let us look back to times that are past. It 
has been a long time since you called the king of Great 
Britain father. You know that it is the duty of a father to 
watch over his children, to give them good advice, and to do 
every thing in his power to make them happy. What has 
this father of yours done for you during the long time that 
you have looked up to him for protection, and advice? Are 
you wiser and happier than you were before you knew him ; 
or is your nation stronger or more respectable? No, my 
Children, he took you by the hand when you were a powerful 
tribe ; you held him fast, supposing that he was your friend, 
and he conducted you through paths filled with thorns and 
briars, which tore your flesh and shed your blood. Your 
strength was exhausted, and you could no longer follow him. 
Did he stay by you in your distress, and assist and comfort 
you? No, he led you into danger, and then abandoned you. 
He saw your blood flowing, and he would give you no bandage 
to tie up your wounds. This was the conduct of the man who 
called himself your father. The Great Spirit opened your 
eyes, you heard the voice of the chief of the Seventeen Fires, 
speaking the words of peace. He called to you to follow 
him — you came to him, and he once more put you on the 
right way, on the broad smooth road that would have led you 
to happiness. But the voice of your deceiver is again heard ; 
and, forgetful of your former suff'erings, you are listening to 
him. 

My Children, shut your ears, and mind him not, or he will 
lead you to ruin and misery. 

My Children, I have heard bad news. The sacred spot 
where the great council fire was kindled, around which the 
Seventeen Fires and ten tribes of their Children smoked the 
pipe of peace — that very spot where the Great Spirit heard 
his white and red children encircle themselves with the chain 
of friendship — that place has been selected for dark and 
bloody councils. 



 

My Children, this business must be stopped. I wll no 
longer suffer it. You have called in a number of men from 
the most distant tribes, to listen to a fool, [the Prophet] who 
speaks not the words of the Great Spirit but those of the devil, 
and of the British agents. 

My Children, your conduct has much alarmed the white 
settlers near you. They desire that you will send away those 
people, and if they wish to have the imposter with them, they 
can carry him. Let him go to the lakes; he can hear the 
British more distinctly. 

The Prophet to Harrison 

[August] 1807 

Dawson, Harrison, pp. 102 & 103 

Father, 

I am very sorry that you listen to the advice of bad birds. — 
You have impeached me with having correspondence with the 
British ; and with calling and sending for the Lidians from the 
most distant parts of the country, "to listen to a fool that 
speaks not the words of the Great Spirit ; but the words of the 
devil." Father, those impeachments I deny, and say they are 
not true. I never had a word with the British, and I never 
sent for any Indians. They came here themselves to listen 
and hear the words of the Great Spirit. 

Father, I wish you would not listen any more to the voice of 
bad birds ; and you may rest assured it is the least of our idea 
to make disturbance, and we will rather try to stop any such 
proceedings than encourage them. 

[The Prophet]

VINCENNES, Sept. 12, 1807 

Cockium, Pioneer History, 216, 217 

Captain Wm Hargrove, Commanding Rangers east of the 
Wabash river 
There has long been an old traveled way from this Post 
that crosses the White river near David Robb's place and the 



 

Patoka rivei- at John Severns', thence in a southwest direction 
to the Wabash river near the point where the Little Wabash 
empties into the main river, thence across the main Wabash 
at that place which can only be crossed by canoes or check 
boats. This route is known by some as the Salt Route. Salt 
has become so scarce and high priced that a number of settlers 
south of White river have petitioned the Governor for an es- 
cort of soldiers to protect them whilst on the trail and at the 
salt works west of the Wabash river. This petition has been 
under consideration for several days. The Governor sent for 
Mr. Robb about this matter and it has been arranged that 
a meeting with the petitioners and other citizens would be 
held at Mr. Kimbles [Jesse Kimball]' who lives on the site of 
the southwest of Mr. Severns', on Thursday the seventeenth 
day of September, 1807. You will temporarily place your 
command in the hands of your Ranking Sergeant and attend 
that meeting, taking two men and one scout with you. After 
due deliberation and consultation with the people present, if 
you think it best you can place two men on duty on the trail 
west of the river but their main camp must be on the east side 
of the Wabash when there are no parties to guard at the salt 
works. The scouts will remain with the two soldiers doing 
regular scouting duties. Instruct him to go for miles on every 
side of the salt works and learn the lay of the country and 
at night to be near the works or with the soldiers at their 
camp east of the river. The salt makers are to be instructed 
to have certain days to make salt and that they must go to the 
works in a body of not less than fifteen men, one-half of that 
number to be at all time ready for military duty, subject to 
the orders of the Sergeant which you place in command, to 
protect the others while the work is in progress. That from 
this relief the camp guards must be furnished day and night. 
The two soldiers are to remain on duty as long as you shall 
think it will be necessary to have a guard. After the first of 
December there is but little danger of Indian raids. This 
side of the Wabash is considered sufficiently safe for so large a

year 1802 a special convention [Dec. 25, 1802 above] of Dele- 
gates from the respective Counties petitioned Congress for a 
suspension of the sixth article of Compact, contained in the 
Ordinance of 1787 : in 1805 a majority of the members of the 
Legislative Council and House of Representatives remon- 
strated with Congress on the subject. [Feb. 7, 1805, above] 
In 1806 the Legislative Council and House of Representatives 
passed sundry resolutions [Feb. 14, 1806, above] which were 
laid before Congress, declaratory of their sense of the propri- 
ety of admitting slaves : and as the Citizens of the Territory 
decidedly approve of the toleration of Slavery the Legislative 
Council and House of Representatives consider it incumbent 
on them, briefly to state, on behalf of themselves and their 
constituents, the reasons which have influenced them in favor 
of the measures. 

In the first place candor induces us to premise that in re- 
gard to the right of holding slaves a variety in opinion exists ; 
whilst some consider it decent and Just to acquire them either 
by purchase or conquest, others consider their possession by 
either tenure as a crime of the deepest stain ; that it is repug- 
nant to every principle of natural Justice of political rights 
and to every sentiment of humanity. Without entering into 
the merits of this controversy it need only be remarked that 
the proposition to introduce Slavery into the Territory is not 
embraced by them. It is not a question of liberty or Slavery. 
Slavery now exists in the United States and in this Territory. 
It was the crime of England and their misfortune. And it 
now becomes a question merely of policy in what way the 
Slaves are to be disposed of, that they may be least dangerous 
to the community, most useful to their proprietors, and by 
which their situation may be most ameliorated. 

As the law of Congress prohibiting the further importation 
of slaves into the Lfnited States takes eff'ect the first of Janu- 
ary next [1808], it is evident that the proposed toleration will 
not increase the number in the United States. 

It is believed, and has not experience verified the fact? that 
such is the number of slaves in the Southern States that the 
safety of individuals as well as the political institutions of 
those States are exposed to no small hazard. However desir- 
able it may be to emancipate them, it can never be done until 
they are dispersed ; it would be equally impolitic for the whites 
as for the 'slaves ; — The great current of emigration is con- 



 

stantly flowing from the Eastern & Southern States to the 
Western States and Territories. The increase of population 
in the Western Country for the last twenty years may afford 
some idea of its probable amount in the course of the present 
century; — It must be immense; and were all the Territories 
opened to the introduction of slaves, a large proportion of 
them would naturally be drawn from the southern States. 

From a reference to the States of Kentucky and Tennessee 
and at the time of the last United States Census, it is not be- 
lieved that the number of Slaves would ever become so great 
as to indanger either the internal peace or future prosperity 
of the Territory. It is also rendered improbable from the in- 
terior situation of the Territory its climate and productions. 

Slavery is tolerated in the Territories of Orleans Mississippi 
and Louisiana; — Why should this Territory be excepted? 

It is believed that Slaves possessed in small numbers by 
farmers are better fed and better Clothed than when they are 
crowded together in quarters by hundreds; — their situation 
in Kentucky, Tennessee, and the back parts of Maryland and 
Virginia verify this belief. 

Resolved by the Legislative Council and House of Repre- 
sentatives of the Indiana Territory That it is expedient to 
suspend for a given number of years the sixth article of com- 
pact contained in the Ordinance for the Government of the 
North- Western Territory passed the 13th day of July in the 
year 1787. 

Resolved that a Copy of the foregoing be forwarded to the 
Vice President of the United States with a request that he 
will lay the same before the Senate and that a Copy be for- 
warded to the Speaker of the House of Representatives with 
a request that he will lay the same before the said House of 
Representatives; and that the Governor of this Territory be 
requested to forward the same as aforesaid. Passed the Leg-

The following Answer was then read and agreed to, and di- 
rected to be prepared by the Secretary to be read again on 
Sunday next, and to be signed by the President, and attested 
by the Secretary in triplicate. 

The French Inhabitants of Vincenes return Thanks to His 
Excellency the Governor for the Communication he has been 
pleased to make to them, correspondent with the sense they 
entertain of the frankness and patriotism with which they are 
addressed; and conceiving that the occasion and the impor- 
tance of the subject communicated, dictate the propriety of 
stating their answer in the form of Resolutions they have 
adopted that mode, as follows. 

Having taken into consideration that part of the Governor's 
Communication which relates to the late outrage committed by 
the British against the United States. 

Resolved unanimously that the french Inhabitants of Vin- 
cennes freely and explicitly unite their feeble but determined 
voice with those of their fellow citizens on the atlantic so gen- 
eraly proclaimed throughout The United States, in the Just ex- 
pression of their detestation and resentment of the late un- 
provoked, cruel and outrageous aggression committed by 
Captn. Humphries of the British Navy in wresting by force of 
Arms four of our Brethren from on board one of the Frigates 
of The United States, in time of Peace. 

Resolved unanimously that we will support with our Lives 
and Fortunes such measures as the constituted authorities of 
our Country may deem proper to adopt and pursue in demand- 
ing and enforcing such Satisfaction from the British Govern- 
ment for this recent, and every other outrage committed by 
them on our National dignity or our Commercial Rights, as 
the United States are entitled to from a Nation boasting to act 
on principles of Right and not of Force. 

Having taken into our serious consideration that part of 
the Governor's Communication which relates to the Patriotism 
and Fidelity of the French Inhabitants of Vincennes and the 
circumstances connected thereto.'^

vened a meeting of the French inhabitants of Vincennes. for the purpose of declaring 
their sentiments upon the abominable outrage and insult committed upon the flag of 
the United States, and the murder of one of their citizens, as well as to express their 
attachment to the government of their country, and their determination to fight for 
and support it. In his address to the meeting, he informed them of the attempts made 
by the emissaries of the British government to prejudice the Indians against the 
Americans, and strongly urged them to detect, and to conmiunicate to him, the names 



 

Resolved unanimously that we perceive with great surprise 
and indignation that there appears to exist in the mind of the 
Governor suspicions of our Patriotism and Fidelity to The 
United States. That under such circumstances a recurrence 
to the evidence of facts in the past conduct of the French In- 
habitants of Vincennes will furnish the strongest arguments 
and proofs in our power to adduce to remove such injurious 
suspicions if they realy exist. 

Was it not with the aid and comfort of our ancestors as 
well as many yet sui-viving, that the Troops of Virginia re- 
duced these Posts? Have we not at all times since, upon 
every occasion demonstrated our Zeal and attachment to the 
United States, and joined their Army in defence of our Coun- 
try, and thereby drawn upon ourselves the eternal hatred of 
the Indians in our vicinity? Have we since the establishment 
of our Territorial Government refused to coopei-ate with our 
fellow citizens in the faithful performance of every required 
duty? But we are disposed to admit that should those in- 
jurious suspicions be entertained by the Governor, they must 
have been imparted to him by evil Counsellors. Should there 
be any persons amongst us, who by their actions or expres- 
sions may have given occasion to such Calumnies, let them 
be exposed and brought to condign punishment. 

It is ungenerous to involve indiscriminately the innocent 
with the guilty, and we deem it no less odious to be suspected 
than to be guilty of infidelity to our Country. If any expres- 
sions favorable to France have been made by any amongst us, 
they arose only from an impression that the coalesced Powers 

of any persons of that description which might come to their ItnowledKe. He also ex- 
pressed some apprehensions that some attempts might be made to weaken their own 
attachment to the government of the United States, and seriously warned them to be 
on their guard against any insidious observations having that tendency : which latter 
remark was made in conseciuence of one of the oldest and most respectable of their 
number having said, that he would have no objections to fight against the Indians. 
but he could not think of taking up arms against the king of Great Britian : to whom 
he had once sworn allegiance. . 

This observation of the Governor called forth the ire of a Scotchman. [Mcintosh] 
notorious for his tory principles ; and he, having considerable influence among the 
persons composing the meeting, by being employed in transacting their business, and 
having a good knowledge of their language, procured himself to be chosen secretary 
of the meeting: and supposing himself to be alluded to as a British emissary, he 
induced them to step forward in his vindication : and he the better succeeded in this. 
as he contrived to impress them with the belief that the Governor had questioned their 
own patriotism, which induced them to make common cause with him. But this 
delusion was soon dissipated, and appropriate resolutions were entered into and handed 
over to the Governor, in order to have them transmitted to the President of the United 
States."

HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 259 

in Europe had views of dismembering a Country from which 
our ancestors emigrated, and for whose Prosperity we do not 
wish to be understood to feel indifferent, while we explicitly 
disavow any partiality for France or any other country, which 
is not consistent with our allegiance to The United States. 
It may be, and we believe it is part of the Governor's official 
duty, to warn the People of the danger that may flow from the 
specious attempts which may be made by British or other for- 
eign Agents, to alienate our affections from our Government, 
and attach us to the British or other Nations: and we seize 
the present occasion to assure His Excellency, and through 
him the General Government, that our attachment and Fidel- 
ity to The United States are sincere, strong and permanent. 
That we know not of British or any other Emissaries or 
Agents in this place, or in the Indian Country: and if ever 
such infamous attempts should be made upon us by any, we 
would regard ourselves as unworthy of our Country, if we 
concealed them for a moment from the constituted authorities. 
We must be permitted to observe that the Person [William 
JMcIntosh] pointed to by your Excellency has lived amongst us 
upwards of twenty years, has acquired a handsome Property, 
and has never to our knowledge or belief attempted to weaken, 
but on the contrary has always, as on the present occasion 
strengthened our zeal in the common cause of our Country. 
It is therefore but an act of Justice to our own honour as well 
as to him to declare, that we regard the means practised to 
lessen him in the good opinion of his fellow citfzens as re- 
pugnant to our sense of the rights secured to every citizen by 
the laws of our Country, as the accusations appear to us to 
be ill founded. 

Resolved, that the Governor be waited upon by the Presi- 
dent, and a committee of two Members of this meeting at one 
o'clock on Sunday next, and present to him two Copies of 
these Proceedings, and that he be and he hereby is requested 
to transmit one of them to the President of The United States, 
as the Answer of the French Inhabitants of Vincennes to His 
Excellencies' Communication. 

On Sunday the 20th September 1807. the foregoing Answer 
was agreed to unanimously.

Captain William Hargrove, Ranger Service : 

Your report of the 19th inst. by your hunter, the Cree In- 
dian, came in two days ago. He was retained to carry mes- 
sages to parties on the old Salt trace. That information was 
wanted from us before this was sent to you. David Robb, 
John Severn, Sr. and Isaac Montgomery^ were here last night. 
The matter of a guard at the salt works was gone over care- 
fully. They all agree with your report that there is no need 
of guards on the east side of the Wabash and if it were not 
for a lot of foolhardy, earless people who would insist on 
going there in small parties, there would be no need of guards 
on the west side of the river. The two men and the scout 
which you have there will remain on duty. The most prob- 
able trouble, if any comes, will be from south of the Ohio river. 
You can have your scout informed of this and have him keep 
a close lookout in that direction. Young Bailey returned sev- 
eral days ago with your report about the refugees [Burr]. 
Retain the three young men which you enlisted if you need 
them. If the three families will come to a point within two 
miles of the Yellow Banks road it will do. If they prefer, 
they can move on to the new road that is being located to the 
east no far from where they are now camped. It is thought 
best for you to have Bailey look after this matter,. These 
people must be near one of these routes and must prepare 
themselves a strong blockhouse with a stockade around it.

1. Thomas Montgomery (Pretty old Tom) "a man who had fought Indians over 
half of Va., all of Ky., and southern Indiana," was the youngest son in a family of 
ten, born to Hugh Montgomery, an Irish emigrant to Va. He served in the Revolution 
and in 1793 came to Ky. He lost his land in Montgomery Co. Ky. and in 1805 located in 
Montgomery Tp. Gibson Co. Ind. His wife was a cousin of Davy Crockett.

Captain Wm. Hargrove, in command of Rangers: 

The Governor wishes to assure you of his appreciation of 
your successful work in gathering so many of the unfortunate 
refugees at points near the Yellow Banks and other traces 
and the large colony which you have gathered on the new 
trace crossing the Yellow Banks road. This is very desirable 
place to have a strong fort. In making the building be sure 
that it is strongly put together, made out of large logs and 
that a stockade ten feet high be built that will enclose one acre 
of ground. In this enclosure can be erected a number of 
strong buildings that will safely protect fifty people. This 
will be a rallying point for all who may come later to that sec- 
tion. The times are very unsettled. The Indians are con- 
tinually grumbling because the white people are in this coun- 
try and threatening that unless their lands are restored they 
will drive them back across the Ohio river. North of the 
White river they could' easily concentrate in such numbers 
that should they find our people unprepared could overrun the 
most of your territory. It is hard to tell anjrthing about what 
an Indian will do when he has the advantage. They are the 
most treacherous, cunning rascals on earth and the most 
brutal as well. The only safe way is to keep the advantage 
on our side and put the Indians on the defense. When they 
know that your position makes one white man equal to ten 
Indians there is no danger of an attack. The two men com- 
ing into your lines east of the Mud-hole have certainly re- 
pented of all the wrong which they have done by following 
after Traitor Burr. It is best for you to see all these people 
who are connected with that unfortunate affair and instruct 
them under no circumstances to let any one know that they 
were in the Burr conspiracy. If they do in after years they 
will be accused of being traitors by people not half so worthy 
as they are.

Dear Sir 

I have the Honor to enclose herewith some Resokitions 
adopted by the French Inhabitants of this place on the 18th 
Ultimo but which were not put into my Hands until a few 
days ago. [September 20, above] 

In the preamble to the Resolutions there are some Circum- 
stances Mentioned which require explanation, thinking that 
a public declaration of attachment to the Government at this 
Crisis would be acceptable to you & honorable to themselves 
I assembled the French Citizens some time since and after 
informing them of the late outrage Committed on our flag by 
the British Vessel & the probability that it might lead to 
War with that nation I recommended to them to take the sub- 
ject into Consideration & adopt some mode of expressing their 
sentiments. The Communication was received by them with 
apparent pleasure and they promised to follow my advice. In 
the course of my address [at Jones' Tavern] I informed them 
also of the attempts which were making by British emissaries 
to prejudice the Indians against the United States & urged 
them to endeavour to Detect & Communicate to me the names 
of any Characters of that description which might Come to 
their knowledge — I expressed also an Apprehension that at- 
tempts might be made to weaken their attachment to the 
American Government — & warned them to be on their guard 
against any insidious obsei-vations having that tendency. The 
latter remark was made in consequence of the oldest & most 
I'espectable of their number having declared that he would 
freely take up ai-ms against the Indians but he could not think 
of fighting against the king of G. Britain to whom he had 
once taken an Oath of Allegiance. A Scotchman of the name 
of Mcintosh who is as inveterate a tory as any of his nation 
and who has considerable influence over them from the neces- 
sity they are under of employing him to transact their busi- 
ness procured himself to be appointed Secretary to their meet- 
ing and supposing that he had been alluded to as a British 
Emissary prevailed upon them to step forward in his vindica- 
tion. To effect this more easily & to induce them to make 
a common cause with him they were prevailed upon to think 



 

that I had in my address expressed some doubts of their 
patriotism, an assertion equally false & mischievous. 

I have the Honor to enclose also the Resignation of Pierre 
Menard [Sept. 19, above] one of the Legislative Council 
which was sent to me only a few days ago from Kaskaskias 
altho it had some time since been announced by him to the 
House of Representatives & Nominations made to fill his va- 
cancy. The persons nominated Messrs [George] Fisher & 
Finne [James Finney] are both respectable men & good Re- 
publicans. Mr Fisher is however the choice of the House of 
Representatives & I believe of his County. [Sept. 12, above]

House of Rrepresentatives Collection portfolio ISO 
Various resolutions & petitions 1807-08 

At a numerous meeting of the Citizens of Clark County in 
Springville (agi-eably to notice previously given) on Satur- 
day the [10] day of October 1807 for the purpose of taking 
into consideration the Resolution past at the last Session of 
the Legislature of the Indiana Territory praying the Congress 
of the United States to suspend for a certain time the sixth 
article of compact contained in the Ordinance, Mr John Beggs^ 
was chosen chairman and Davis Floyd Secretary. 

On Motion Ordered that a Committee of five suitable per- 
sons be appointed to draft and report to this meeting a Me- 
morial to Congress in opposition to the Resolutions of the 
Legislature of the Indiana Territory on the subject of Slavery 
in this Territory by the suspension of the sixth article of 
Compact contained in the Ordinance and the said Committee 
was appointed of Messrs Absalom Little^ John Owens^ Charles 

1. John Bei,'K3. The BeEss family was descended from James Bet'es of Ireland. 
The grandfather, Thomas Beg^s. was born in New Jersey but soon moved to Western 
Va. He died in the service as a Revolutionary soldier. The three brothers, James, 
John and Charles came to Clark county, early, by way of Kentucky, and bought laree 
farms. All were church leaders, John, the oldest was a Baptist. All served in various 
capacities. Charles was a captain of militia under Harrison at Tippecanoe.

Beggs* Robert Robertson' and James Beggs"* Mr Little from 
the aforesaid Committee reported a memorial pursuant to the 
aforesaid Order in the words and figures following (Viz, 

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States in Congress assembled 

The memorial of the Citizens of Clark County Humbly 
sheweth, that great anxiety has been and still is evinced by 
some of the Citizens of this Territory on the subject of the 
introduction of Slavery into the same ; But in no case has the 
voice of the Citizens been unanimous. In the year 1802 at 
a special convention of delegates from the respective Coun- 
ties a petition was forwarded to Congress to repeal the sixth 
article of Compact contained in the Ordinance, But the rep- 
resentation of all that part of the Territory East of Knox 
County were present and were decidedly opposed to that part 
of the petition 

In the year 1805 the subject was again taken up and dis- 
cussed in the general assembly and a Majority of the house 
of Representatives voted against said memorial on the afd. 
subject, and consequently, the Memorial was rejected as the 
Journals of that House doth sufficiently evince; But a num- 
ber of Citizens thought proper to sign the same and amongst 
the rest the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the 
President of the Council (tho the president of the Council 
denies ever having signed the same) and by some Legislative 
Legerdemain it found its way into the Congress of the United 
States as the Legislative act of the Territory. In the present 
year 1807 the subject was again taken up by the Legislature 
of this Territory and a Majority of both houses passed cer- 
tain resolutions (in the proportion of two to one) for the 
purpose of suspending the sixth article of compact contained 

2. Absalom Little or Littell with his family was one of the first settlers of Clark 
county. His home was near Sellersburg. He came from Penn. in 1779. He was an 
elder in the Presbyterian church. On or near his farm was or^'anized one of the 
earliest protestant churches in Ind. — a Baptist church. 1788. In 1801 Little was ap- 
pointed an appraiser for Springville. Harrison appointed him a justice Oct. 27, 1808.

3. John Owens was one of the original settlers of Clarksville, 1783 ; Dec. 24, 1803 
he was appointed a Falls pilot : Sept. 20, 1803 he was made Capt. of militia : promoted 
to major Auk. 16. 1806: during the war of 1812 he served with the mounted rifles as a 
lieutenant and captain. He served under Bigger at Tippecanoe,

in the Ordinance which we presume is before your Honorable 
body 

But let it be understood that in the Legislative Council 
there were but three members present and the president of 
the same (for certain reasons) positively refused to sign 
the said Resolutions and they were reduced to the last subter- 
fuge of prevailing- on the president to leave his seat and one 
of the other members take it as president pro tern, for the 
purpose of signing the said Resolutions (whether this is right 
or wrong Judge ye) 

And altho' it is contended by some that at this day there 
is a Majority in favour of Slavery (whilst the opposite opin- 
ion is held by others) tho' the fact is certainly doubtful. But 
when we take a view of the vast emigration into this Terri- 
tory and of Citizens too decidedly opposed to the measure we 
feel satisfied, that at all events Congress will suspend any 
Legislative act on this subject until we shall by the Constitu- 
tion be admitted into the Union and have a right to adopt 
such a constitution in this respect as may comport with the 
wishes of a Majority of the Citizens. 

As to the propriety of Holding those in slavery whom it 
hath pleased the divine Creator to Create free, seems to us 
to be repugnant to the inestimable principals of a Republican 
government. Altho' some of the States have and do hold 
slaves, Yet it seems to be the general opinion even in those 
states that they are an evil from which they can not extricate 
themselves. As to the Interest of the Territory a variety 
of opinion exists; But suffer your memorialists to state that 
it is a fact that a great number of Citizens in various parts 
of the United States are preparing and many have actually 
emigrated to this Territory to get free from a government 
which does tolerate Slavery. 

The Toleration of Slavery is either right or wrong and if 
Congress should think with us that it is wrong that it is in- 
consistent with the principals upon which our future Consti- 
tution is to be formed, your Memorialists, will rest satisfied, 
at least, that this subject will not be by them taken up until 
the Constitutional number of the Citizens of this Territory 
shall assume that right 

It is considered useless for your Memorialists to recapitu- 
late the many reasons and objections which might be ad- 
vanced, relying that this subject is fully and fairly under- 



 

stood by your Honorable Body as it relates to the natural 
right policy and prosperity of a free and independent nation. 

On Motion Resolved that the chairman be requested to for- 
ward duplicate Copies of these proceedings (Signed by the 
said Chairman and Counter signed by the Secretary) One to 
the Vice President of the United States or President of the 
Senate pro Tern and One to the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives in the Congress of the United States

William Hargrove, Ca'ptain Commanding in Ranger Service: 
Your report and the man you sent in under guard, are here. 
You did the right thing in an-esting this man. All such sus- 
picious cases as this should be investigated. What this man 
is has not yet been found out and it is doubtful if it ever is. 
If this country were at war with a white race it would evi- 
dently be determined that he was a spy locating the military 
strength and positions of our army. It may be that he is 
doing that v.ork for the British. He evidently is not what he 
claims to be. A prisoner for two years among the Indians 
would not have such clean underwear beneath his buckskin 
suit. Then his hair has been recently cut by a barber. He 
will be retained for the present. This is Sunday and the cart 
drivers are all at a gathering down the river someway. Will 
forward the supplies tomorrow.

Captain William Hargrove, Commanding Rangers: 

Your report by FuQuay is received. The flints were of a 
new lot. Since your statement has come they have been ex- 
amined and found to be of shelly material and are of no value. 
Others will be sent you as soon as possible. Have your men 
save the old ones until the others come. 

The statement of the Delaware Indian that he has seen the 
prisoner whom we are holding as a spy at Clarkesville, two 
moons ago is noted. 

The old trace that runs near the Ohio river crossing the 
Wabash and on the saline regions of the Illinois has been a 
regular pass way for Indians from time when none know. 
The Shawnees under chief Setteedown^ have, as you know, a 
straggling settlement along this trail and extending to about 
ten miles off the Yellow Banks trace that you patrolled. Our 
scouts from this place have often been over the route and vis- 
ited some white people located on the north bank of the Ohio. 
Major John Sprinkles,- who lives on the north bank some six 
miles up the river from the mouth of Green river was to see 
the Governor yesterday and informed him that detached bands 
of Indians had been passing east for eight or ten days and 
appeared to be carrying their luggage with them. Bailey 
Anderson,^ who lives in the neighborhood of a few of the 

1. Setteedown or Settetah was chief of a small straggling band of nondescript 
Indians, mostly Shawnees. Their village from 1807 to 1811 was near the mouth of 
Cypress creek Warrick county. In 1811 he was implicated in the murder of the Meeks 
family of Spencer county and killed.

For a more detailed account see Arvil Barr, in Indiana May. of Hist. XIV, 301,-331 

2. John Sprinkle was the first permanent settler of Warrick county, he was a 
Pennsylvanian born 1772. From there he located in Henderson 1792. He came to 
Indiana in 1803 and settled at Newburg Warrick county where he died, 1821. His 
title of Major is from the Ky. militia. A brother, George, was captured during the 
Miami war, about 1790 and ransomed at Fort Wayne about 1794.

Shawnee wigwams, informed Mr. Sprinkles that some of these 
visiting Indians were preparing a camp not more than one 
mile from his cabin. This may be nothing but hunting par- 
ties from over the Wabash. Any unusual gathering of In- 
dians on the Ohio river at this time of the year is looked on 
with suspicion. They may intend to remain during the winter 
and if a chance comes, attempt to capture boats and movers 
descending the river as soon as the water is in sufficient stage. 
You will temporarily leave your command in charge of Ser- 
geant Hogue, taking two reliable men with you and at your 
settlement secure mounts for your parties. Then go south 
along the Red Banks route and up to Major Sprinkles' cabin, 
who is aware of your coming. Bailey Anderson will fall in 
with your party as you go east from the Major's. You are 
to make an official visit to chief Setteedown. Bailey Ander- 
son understands their language and will act as interpreter. 
Before leaving the old Chief invite him to bring some of his 
young men and visit Governor Harrison at this Post. Have 
him set the day as early as he will. You will then proceed 
east on the trace until you come to where it crosses the road 
running to the north that comes to the Ohio river just west 
of the mouth of Blue river. Thoroughly familiarize yourself 
with the route. In returning, note well the topography of the 
country. Return the two men to their station and you report 
in person to this post.

Captain William Hargrove, Commanding the Western Divi- 
sion of Rangers east of the Wabash river: 
Last Sunday night the 18th inst. two of our scouts returning 
from a long trip found themselves at White Oak Spring 
[Petersburg] for a little after seven o'clock in the evening. 
On going to the gate asked permission to stay over night in 
the stockade, which was denied them. They were informed 
that when the gates were closed for the night that they could 



 

not be opened for anyone. The scouts showed their passes 
signed by Governor Harrison, yet they were refused admit- 
tance saying that Governor Harrison nor any of his men could 
get in after night. The Governor directs that you investigate 
this matter. Scout Ell Ernest, the bearer of this order, will 
be permitted to be present while the investigation is being 
made as he was one of the scouts who was refused permission 
to stay in the stockade. Go fully into the details. The Mili- 
tary authorities are doing everything possible with the few 
men at their command to protect the settlers who are scattered 
on the southern borders of this Territory and cheerfully do 
this hard service, imperilling the lives of the best men of the 
country, trying to give protection to those who are exposed 
to danger; but when it comes to such actions as is above re- 
lated of men who were being guarded, insulting and denying 
the common coutesies to those guarding them that is so fully 
extended by all decent pioneer settlers to all who come to their 
cabins. Some parties at that fort are guilty of indignities 
that will not be silently passed over. Find, if you can if the 
owner of that fort was at home that night. Secure the names 
of the men who were there and if possible the one who was 
spokesman. When you have made this investigation send the 
report to this office by Ell Ernest.

Wm Hargrove, Captain Commanding Rangers: 

Chief Settedowii and his young men have retunied to their 
homes. He assured the Governor that the Indians gathering 
in his neighborhood were very peaceable inclined toward the 
■ white people and gave as a reason for their being there that 
game was more plentiful than across the Wabash and that 
they intended to stay only a short while. In answering the 
inquiry why he did not want to keep all the game for himself 
and people, said, that there was much more than he wanted. 
Finally said in less than one moon they would all go back over 
the Wabash. It is hoped that this will be true, but the only 
security with the Indians is to be always prepared and watch 
them. FuQuay is better acquainted with that section than 
any one else we have in the service. He and Ben Page have 
orders to report to you at your east stockade camp, on the 
Clarksville trace and will hand you this letter. It is thought 
best for you to go with the two scouts to the Yellow Banks 
and have them make such disposition of their time during 
the next thirty days as will secure the best information of the 
movements of the strange Indians. This suggestion is made 
for your consideration in this matter. You are on the ground 
and will understand the situation better than can be under- 
stood at this distance. The two scouts have each a new ax 
besides their rifles and ammunition. This is the equipment 
that most of the newcomers bring to the Territory. Have 
them go into the section a few miles east of Bailey Anderson's 
and build a small cabin and put in their time hunting and 
roving over as large a territory around their cabin as they 
can. In doing this they will have a pretty good idea of what 
the Indians are doing around them. If there is any design 
other than friendship by the newcomers, the Shawnees know 
it. Of all this you are in the best position to find out the 
truth. The two scouts will send or bring you a report as often 
as you think best to require it. You are safe in giving FuQuay 
your confidence as he is one of the most trusted men that is 
in the employ of these head-quarters.

Harrison to Hargrove 

Post Vincennes, November 4, 1807 

Cockrum, Pioneer History, 223 

Captain Wm. Hargrove, Commanding a Detachment of 
Rangers: 

The location for the refugees is no doubt a good one. 
Plenty of water is very desirable. The Governor is favorable 
to your suggestion. It certainly would be to the advantage 
of the new emigrants for them to prepare a little cabin in- 
side of the stockades and to remain in it during the winter. 
If they prefer to go to some other place in the spring they 
can do so. The advantage of being with a number of people 
during the cold season in hunting and the social advantages 
is recompense enough for all the trouble they would be at to 
erect the little cabin. 

Your opinion of FuQuay is correct. He has been closely 
identified with the work in this part of the Territory since 
1801. The Governor would gladly comply with your request 
but his services as scout is of such importance that it is not 
thought best to take him out of that position. Sergeant Hogue 
would fill the place you wanted FuQuay for with a little train- 
ing. 

The supposed spy has been sent to Fort Washington [Cin- 
cinnati] with a statement of the evidence and the affidavit 
against him. There will be no further need of hunting evi- 
dence in that case. Without a doubt he is a spy for the 
British and will be held as such for an indefinite time unless 
direct evidence of his guilt should be secured. Then he v\rill 
be summarily dealt with. 

You now have four roads or traces running to the east that 
can be easily found and traveled over, dividing your territory 
into sections between the Ohio and White rivers. Also you 
h^ve four roads or traces running north and south dividing 
your territory in that direction from near the Wabash on the 
west to Blue river on the east, thus enabling you to give much 
better protection to settlers nov/ there and to the emigrants 
coming into your territory.^ This condition makes that sec- 
tion of this territory very desirable for settlers. The most 



 

important thing that you can do is to see that the blockhouses 
are so located that they will be accessible to those in the sur- 
rounding country if danger should come. There is no cer- 
tainty that we will have a continuation of the quiet that now 
exists. The English on the north are doing all that they can 
to cause trouble between the Indians and the pioneers, using 
the treaties which have been made as a pretext, claiming that 
it was fradulently obtained. 

It is thought best that you make a personal inspection of 
all the blockhouses that are now built and the several that 
are being constructed at the different stations in your ter- 
ritory and see that they are securely built and good, strong, 
durable stockades surrounding them that will have sufficient 
room for the construction of from six to ten small cabins. 
Some one who is most competent in each fort must be placed 
in command and it must be understood that he is to be obeyed 
by all of those who will use that fort as a place of refuge. 

Have them select by lot the man they want, but advice those 
interested that the most efficient men thay have should be 
chosen. You will make a careful inspection of their arms 
and ammunition and should you find them deficient in either 
you can make a requisition on the ordnance office at this 
place through these head-quarters for the needed supplies. 
That needed for the eastern forts will be forwarded to you 
at White Oak Springs fort. That for the western division 
will be sent to David Robb's fort. You will have the proper 
parties meet you at a stated period at these places and give 
out the guns and ammunition to them taking their receipts 
for the same. This will simplify the work as soon as you can 
have a sufficient number of forts so that they will be reason- 
able accessible in all the Territory, which you command, the 
need of the Rangers continually marching over the traces 
will be done away with. Carefully read this letter of sug- 
gestions and when you send in your next report any sugges- 
tions you may have to make will receive careful consideration.

Cockrum, Pioneer History of Indiana, 225-227 

Capt. Wm. Hargrove, Commanding first division of Rangers, 
east of the Wabash river: 

Your report enclosing a letter from FuQuay. The contents 
of that letter were fully considered by the Governor. That 
there would be some excuse made for the Indians to remain 
during the winter months has been suspected. The fact that 
they are building such secure tepees warrants that suspicion, 
but their attempt to be adopted into the tribe of the Shawnees 
was unlooked for. The Governor directs that you have a 
vigilant watch kept on their actions until about the 26th 
inst. the time Chief Setteedown set for their return will then 
be up. Better have Bailey Anderson interview the old Chief 
and in their talk remind him of his promise to Governor that 
they would be gone in one moon. FuQuay and Anderson it 
seems found out that the Illinois Indians on the visit are 
Kickapoos and that they have one of their subchiefs in com- 
mand of them. This looks suspicious. You can do nothing 
as yet, only have FuQuay and Ben Page keep a vigilant watch 
on the Indians and instruct them to send one of your runners, 
who you will keep near them, to you with any information 
that they may secure. If you should learn any new danger- 
ous developments, send immediately to this head-quarters a 
report of it. If it should become necessary, one hundred men 
can be sent from this Post to any point which you may think 
best to place them. The Governor thinks it best to make a 
camp on the Yellow Banks trace at the point where the large 
fort is located [formerly called Taylorsvile, now Selvin, War- 
rick county, Ind.] If the stockade is not as large as is 
needed, it can be enlarged and in a short time the soldiers 
can put up such barracks as will make them comfortable for 
the short time that they will likely stay. 

The Piankashaw Indian, named Yellow Bird has just re- 
turned from a visit to Indian friends on the west fork of 
White river. He said to one of our friendly Indians that 
the Indians on White river were grumbling about the treaties 
and threatening to drive the Americans back over the Ohio. 
That there is a great unrest among the Indians is not doubted 



 

by those whose business it is to know what is going on out- 
side of the settlements. What it may terminate in is un- 
certain. It is best for our people to be well on their guard 
and be ready in the event war should come. 

By order of the Governor 
John Gibson, Sec'y. of Indiana Temtory 

Post Script. : The Governor directs that you ascertain how 
many able-bodied men you have in your district that would 
be able to bear arms. This duty can be done by some of your 
active young men. 

Senate Report on Slavery in Indiana 

November 13, 1807 

Am. Sta. Pa. Misc. I, i8i 

Mr. Franklin, from the committee^ to whom was referred 
the representation and resolution of the Legislature Council 
and House of Representatives of the Indiana Territory, bear- 
ing the date of 13th of July, [?] 1807; [September 19 above] 
and, also, the remonstrance of the citizens of Clark county, 
of the Territory aforesaid, [October 10, above] reported : 

The Legislative Council and House of Representatives, in 
their resolutions, express their sense of the propriety of in- 
troducing slavery into their Territory, and solicit the Con- 
gress of the United States to suspend, for a given number 
of years, the sixth article of compact, in the ordinance for 
the government of the Territory northwest of the river Ohio, 
passed the 13th day of July, 1787. That article declares: 
"there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in 
the said Territory." 

The citizens of Clark county, in their remonstrance, ex- 
press their sense of the impropriety of the measure, and 
solicit the Congress of the United States not to act on the 
subject, so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the 
Territory; at least until their population shall entitle them 
to form a constitution and State Government. 

1. This committee consisted of Jesse Franldin of North Car., Aaron Kitchell of 
New Jersey and Edward Tiffin of Ohio. The two petitions, one from the territorial 
legislature, dated Sept. 19, 1807. the other from citizens of Clarl< county, dated Oct. 
10, 1807 are given in the Annals. (Senate) under date of Nov. 13, 1807. 



 

Your committee, after duly considering the matter, respect- 
fully submit the following resolution: 

Resolved, That it is not expedient at this time to suspend 
the sixth article of compact for the government of the ter- 
ritory of the United States northwest of the river Ohio.

House of Representatives Collection portfolio 180 
Various Resolutions & petitions 1807-08 

The Committee,^ to whom were referred the letter from 
William Henry Harrison governor of the Indiana territory, 
inclosing certain resolutions passed by the Legislative Coun- 
cil and House of Representatives of said territory [Sept. 19, 
supra] , relative to the suspension for a certain period, of the 
sixth article of compact [Ordinance of 1787] between the 
United States and the territories and states north-west of 
the river Ohio, made the 13th of July 1787. And the Me- 
morial of the inhabitants of Clark county in the Indiana ter- 
ritory — 

Report 

They have attentively considered the Resolution of the Leg- 
islative council and House of Representatives of the Indiana 
territory — stating the expediency of suspending for a given 
number of years — the sixth article of Compact — contained in 
the ordinance for the governinent of the North Western ter- 
ritory — passed the 13th of July in the year 1787 — together 
with the reasoning in favor of said resolution — And also — 
a counter memorial of a number of Citizens of Clark county 
in the said Territory of Indiana — [October 10, above] 

It appears to the committee as well from the statement of 
the Legislative council & House of Representatives of said 
territory — as from the Memorial of the Citizens of Clark 
county, — that a difference of opinion exists in the territory, 
as to the right of holding slaves — and as to the propriety of 
introducing them within the said territory. 

1. This committee was composed of Jacob Richards of Penn.. William Kirk- 
patrick of N. Y., John Love of Va., John Davenport of Conn., Josiah Deane of Mass. 
and Benjamin Parke of Ind. appointed Nov. 6, 1807. They reported Nov. 17. It will 
be noted it was a northern committee. These petitions were presented in the senate 
Nov. 7. See Senate report supra. 



 

On a subject of such magnitude, as the introduction of 
slavery (which by numbers is considered as a serious evil, 
and to be cautiously avoided) the voice of the Citizens should 
be clearly ascertained. How far the introduction of slavery 
in said territory would operate to the prejudice, & injuiy of 
one part of the Citizens; and to the advancement & pros- 
perity of the other, your committee cannot undertake to say — 
but the policy of a measure, that probably would have that 
tendency, without promoting the public-good, is at least ques- 
tionable. 

In a few years, from the rapid grovsrth of population in the 
territory, its numbers, will entitle it to be admitted into the 
Union, as an Indepe^ident State, when the Citizens will have 
a right to adopt such measures, as may comport with their 
wishes on the subject. 

Your Committee are of opinion — that it would be im- 
proper at this time for Congress to legislate on the subject — 
And submit the following Resolution. — 

Resolved, 

That it is inexpedient to suspend for a given number of 
years, the sixth article of Compact, contained in the ordi- 
nance for the government of the North-Western territory, 
passed the 13th day of July in the year 1787 —

Captain Wm. Hargrove, in the Ranger Service: 

The men will be sent in two hours from the time your 
runner arrives if they will be needed. If you think that fifty 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 277 

men will be sufficient, that number will be sent. It is best 
to have all that will be needed. 

At a point some miles below the mouth of White river, 
there has been some trouble between the settlers and the In- 
dians who had a few wigwams some distance to the east of 
the Wabash river. Two Piankashaw Indians are here to-day. 
They say that their people were driven away across the 'Wa- 
bash river and their tepees, skins and plunder burned. 

It is directed that you go and investigate this matter and 
see what can be done about obtaining a satisfactory adjust- 
ment with the Indians. Everything has been done here to 
allay the ill feelings of the two Indians. The Governor ordered 
some tents, blankets and kettles to be sent to those who lost 
their property. If you can find out who the white people 
were you will remind them that such conduct as this must 
not occur again. This Territory is in no shape for a race 
war with the Indians, v^hich they would be only too glad for 
an excuse to engage in. It might be best that you take David 
Robb and some other of your best informed citizens with you 
when you make the investigation. The Indians who were 
driven away are with another band of Piankashaw Indians 
west of the Wabash several miles below the mouth of the 
White river.

Captain Hargrove, Commanding Rangers: 

You will personally invite Bailey Anderson to visit these 
Headquarters. The Governor wishes to properly recognize 
his services in persuading old Chief Setteedown to force the 
Kickapoo Indians back to their homes west of the Wabash. 
There will be no further trouble in that direction. Your esti- 
mate of the number of men in your Territory able to bear 
arms shows a very gratifying condition. A little more work 
in locating forts and stockades at two or three exposed places. 



 

will place you in good condition to repel any attack that may 
be made on the settlements.

William Hargrove, Commanding the Western Division of 
Rangers east of the Wabash river: 

The Governor directs that you discharge the men v/ho are 
on patrol duty except those who are on duty on the trace 
east of White Oak Springs Fort. The patrol over that route 
need not go over that trace but once in every eight days. 
The scout and the two friendly Indians will patrol the sec- 
tion of White river from the forks up to as far as twenty- 
five miles east of the Mudholes. There is more danger aris- 
ing from stray bands of Indians attempting to come into the 
settlement for the purpose of stealing horses than there is 
of an attack on the settlers. 

In discharging the men, any whom you find who wish to 
remain in the service, you will enlist for regular soldiers and 
order them to report to these head-quarters with a copy of 
their enlistment papers. When you have finished this work, 
have scouts, FuQuay and Page remain with you and with 
them visit every portion of your Territory and notify the 
people at the blockhouses and the settlements that they must 
keep a vigilant lookout, as the Rangers will be withdrawn. 
After having visited all the stations, return to White Oak 
Springs and discharge all but two of the men and Sergeant 
Hogue who you will place in command with instructions to 
carefully watch the section east of the Mudholes on his patrol ; 
and for him to report by the hand of one of the friendly 
Indians to these head-quarters once every two weeks. When 
you have finished this work you will report to this Post, bring- 
ing FuQuay and Ben Page with you.

House Report on Vincennes University 

December 17, 1807 

Am. Sta. Pa. Misc. I, 65i 

The Committee^ on Commerce and Manufactures report: 

The petitioners state that the Legislature of the Indiana 
Territory in the year 1806, passed an act incorporating a 
university in the district of Vincennes. styled the University 
of Vincennes ; and that the same act authorized the petition- 
ers to dispose of a small part of the land appropriated by an 
act of Congress for the purpose of erecting the necessary 
buildings for said institution. The petitioners state that, as 
the land belonging to the institution cannot be leased at pres- 
ent to advantage, they pray that Congress will pass a law 
laying a small tax on salt made at the public works in that 
Territory, and also on Indian traders, for the support of the 
said institution, until the other institutions in the Territory 
are organized can be benefited by the fund accruing there- 
from. 

The committee have given to the petition of the trustees 
of the University of Vincennes that deliberate attention 
which its importance demands. They are sensible of every 
disposition that can be friendly to institutions the objects of 
which are to inculcate and disseminate knowledge of every 
kind. The people of no nation can be so deeply interested in 
promoting and encouraging the sciences as the citizens of a 
republic. They are frequently called upon personally to per- 
form public duties of high concern, on the right discharge of 
which the happiness of individuals and the prosperity of the 
community depend. Information in the mass of the citizens 
is one of the best securities that can be devised against the 
abuses of power; and it operates no less forcibly in checking 
and restraining the aspiring ambition and subtle arts of those 
to whose care is confided the public welfare. 

As public and private virtues spring from and are fostered 
and matured by true knowledge, it becomes one of the first 
obligations of this Government, if it can constitutionally ex- 
ercise the power to take under its patronage institutions 
that are calculated to insure its diffusion. 

1. This committee consisted of Thomas Newton of Va., Richard Cutts of Mass- 
David Thomas of N. Y.. William McCreery of Md.. Samuel W. Dana of Conn., Robert 
Marion of South Car., and John Porter of Penn. The report is Riven in Annals (H. R.) 
Dec. 17, 1807. The petition is not given. 



 

The committee will inquire what considerations have been 
given to a subject of so much moment by the National Gov- 
ernment? The Territories of the United States are under 
the superintending authority of the General Government. 

In the acts of Congress we are, therefore, to look for the 
care and solicitude they had a right to expect from their 
common guardian. As the district of Vincennes, in the In- 
diana Territory, is brought into view by the petition of the 
trustees of the Vincennes University, it becomes the duty of 
the committee to ascertain whether the bounty of the Gen- 
eral Government to that Territoi-y has been sufficiently large. 
By an act of the 26th of March, 1804, making provision for 
the disposal of the public lands in the Indiana Territory, and 
for other purposes, a section of land, equal to 640 acres, in 
each township, is reserved for the support of public schools; 
and one entire township is set apart in each of the three dis- 
tricts into which that Territory is divided for the use of 
seminaries of learning. To the district of Vincennes is al- 
lotted one entire township, which contains twenty-three thou- 
sand and forty acres of land. The price of an acre is esti- 
mated at two dollars ; and the value of the donation amounts 
fully to forty-six thousand and eighty dollars. On this state- 
ment the committee are willing to rest the claim of Congress 
to the gratitude of the citizens of that Territory and their 
posterity for the munificent allotments of land which have 
been made for the promotion of the sciences. The commit- 
tee are constrained to notice the prayer of the petitioners. 
It is, that a law may be passed "laying a small tax on salt 
made at public works in that Territory, and also a tax on 
Indian traders, for the support of the Vincennes University, 
until the other seminaries are organized, and are in a situ- 
ation to participate in the revenue raised and collected from 
those taxes." The committee will here take the liberty of 
observing, that, whenever the population of that Territory 
shall be so advanced and increased as to requii'e seminaries 
of learning on the extensive scale of universities the liberal 
donations of the General Government will be found to be com- 
mensurate with the views of the petitioners and with the just 
and laudable intentions of the donor. The reservation of the 
salt springs for future disposal in that Territory evidently 
points out the desi^ of Congress, which was to furnish a 
necessary of life at a moderate price, by keeping and pre- 



 

serving the source of it from the monopoly of spectulators. 
The committee are not a little surprised that the enlightened 
policy of Congress should escape the notice and penetration 
of so intelligent and so respectable a body of men as the 
trustees of the University of Vincennes. 

The committee, flatter themselves that the withholding of 
their assent from the prayer of the petition will be justified 
by that liberal mode of thinking v/hich is inspired by the 
sciences, and by that true spirit of justice which equally and 
impartially regards the rights of all. 

With deference to the House, they submit the following 
resolution : 

Resolved, That, ample provision having already been made 
for the support of public schools and for seminaries of learn- 
ing in the district of Vincennes, the prayer of the trustees of 
the University of Vincennes is unreasonable, and ought not 
be granted.

Sir: 

The Delaware Tribes have determined to remove the ensu- 
ing Spring from their present habitations to settle over on 
the west side of the Mississippi. Their particular destination 
is White River [Missouri] to which they say they have been 
invited by the Indians of that country. I can see no injury 
that will result to the United States from this removal; on 
the contrary it will leave vacant a fine tract of country im- 
mediately contiguous to the settled parts of the State of Ohio 
and the upper county of this territory which may in a short 
time be purchased. If however the President's view of this 
subject should be difi'erent from mine I will upon receiving 
your instructions endeavour to stop their emigration which 
will probably take place in the latter part of March and the 
beginning of April next.

Dear Sir 

I duly received your letter of Oct. 10. covering the resolu- 
tions of the French inhabitants of Vincennes, and had hoped 
that their uneasiness under your supposed want of confidence 
in them had subsided, but a letter lately received from their 
chairman, [Laurent Bazadone, Chm. Wm Mcintosh is meant] 
covering another copy of the same resolutions induces me to 
answer them, in order to quiet all further uneasiness. I in- 
close you my answer, [January 30, below] open, for your 
perusal, and will thank you to seal and deliver it. I have ex- 
pressed to them the opinion I have long entertained of the 
antient Canadian French, on a long course of information, & 
as it is favorable to them, I trust it will be soothing, and re- 
store those good dispositions which will ease the execution of 
your duties, and tend to produce that union which the present 
crisis calls for. 

Russia and Portugal have cut off all intercourse with Eng- 
land, their Ambassadors recalled, and war follows of course. 
Our difficulties with her are great ; nor can it yet be seen how 
they will terminate. Accept my salutations & assurances of

I received some days ago your letter of Dec. 15. covering 
a copy of the resolutions of the French inhabitants of Vin- 
cennes of Sep. 18. in answer to the address of Govr. Harrison, 
who had, in the month of October forwarded me a copy of the 
same, in his letter inclosing it he assured me that his address 
to them on the subject of our differences with England was 
merely monitory, putting them on their guard against insinu- 
ations from any agent of that country, who might find their 
way among them, and containing no expression, which if truly 
explained to them, should have conveyed the least doubt of his 



 

confidence in their fidelity to the United States. I had hoped 
therefore that the uneasiness expressed in their resolutions 
had been done away by subsequent explanations, as I have 
no reason to believe any such distrust existed in the gover- 
nor's mind. I can assure them that he never expressed such 
a sentiment in any of his communications to me, but that 
whenever he has had occasion to speak of them, it has been 
in terms of entire approbation & attachment, in my own 
mind certainly no doubts of their fidelity have ever been ex- 
cited or existed, having been the Governor of Virginia when 
Vincennes & the other French settlements of that quarter 
surrendered to the arms of that state, 28 years ago, I have had 
a particular knolege of their character as long perhaps as any 
person in the US, and in the various relations in which I have 
been placed with them by the several offices I have since held, 
that knolege has been kept up. and to their great honor I 
can say that I have ever considered them as sober, honest, and 
orderly citizens, submissive to the laws, and faithful to the 
nation of which they are a part: and should occasion arise of 
proving their fidelity in the cause of their country, I count 
on their aid with as perfect assurance as on that of any other 
part of the US. in return for this confidence, and as an addi- 
tional proof on their part that it is not misplaced, I ask of 
them a return to a perfect good understanding with their gov- 
ernor, and to that respect for those in authority over them 
which has hitherto so honorably marked their character, as 
to myself they may be assured that my confidence in them is 
undiminished, and that nothing will be wanting on the part of 
the general goveinment to secure them in the full participa- 
tion of all the rights civil & religious which are enjoyed by 
their fellow citizens in the union at large. I beg leave through 
you to salute them as well as yourself with affection & respect.

Sir: 

From everything that I see and hear it appears that the 
disposition of the Indians in this vicinity is as friendly 



 

towards the United States as it every has been. I have how- 
ever no faith in the pacific declarations of those in the neigh- 
borhood of the lakes. If they do not take up the hatchet in 
the event of a war with Great Britain fear not love will re- 
strain them. And this is the opinion of all the well informed 
chiefs in this quarter. Should they meditate hostilities you 
may depend on it that they will not throw off the mask until 
they are ready to strike. The professions of no Indians are to 
be relied upon implicitly but the Potawatimis, Ottawas and 
Chippewas who reside in the neighborhood of Detroit are the 
most perfideous of their race. They have been so long used 
to play a double game between our agents and those of the 
British that they are perfect in the arts of deception. I have 
also very strong suspicions that the Sacs are not friendly to 
us. A few weeks ago a party of 8 or 10 passed through the 
Delaware towns on White River, a mission to the Shawnee 
Prophet. In a conversation with the chief of the village they 
declared it to be the intention of their tribe to support the 
prophet against all his enemies. 

Mr. Wells informs me that there is a very unusual assem- 
blage of Potawatomies in the vicinity of Fort Wayne. He 
thinks their intentions perfectly pacific and that their only 
object is to get an occasional supply of provisions of which 
he says they are in great want. I have directed him to keep 
a watchful eye over them and to send me two or three of the 
chiefs whom I have designated that I may endeavour to dis- 
cover what their designs really are. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir Your humble 
servt.

Secretary of War to Harrison 

Jeffersonville Feby. 20. [1808] 

Sir: Your Excellencies letter of the 18th ult. has been re- 
ceived All prudent measures ought to be pursued to counter- 
act the management of our neighbours but we ought not to 



 

shew any improper anxiety for cultivating peace with those 
Indians who may have hostile views, the principal chiefs ought 
to be told in strong terms that their future existence must in 
a great measure depend on their own conduct in case of war. 
I wish you could find sufficient leisure to visit Ft. Wayne for 
the purpose of ascertaining the real objects and views of Wells 
as well as the Indians at Greenville &c. I fear that Wells 
is too attentive to pecuniary considerations.^

Sir, 

The Messenger sent out to the Glaize [on the Maumee] on 
the 10th Instant, is not yet returned, I am much at a loss to 
account for his delay, he was desired to proceed to that place 
and see Mr. Fisher, who your Excellency has appointed an 
Interpreter, and to desire him to come in immediately & to 
bring the Shawanese Chiefs with him, and also the Prophet, 
the message was verbal, no writing was trusted with him for 
fear of accidents; the only way that I can account for his 
delay, is that there may be some difficulty in persuading the 
Prophet (Lau-be-was-i-kaw) also (Els-qua-a-tawa) to come 
in. 

On the 24th instant I had a long conference with Guyash, a 
Chief of the Chippewa Nation, a tried soldier & trusty man, 
after a good deal of conversation he told me, that on his way 
here he called on the Governor [William Hull] at Detroit and 
asked him for news, the Govr. told him he had received let- 
ters from Washington, and said that the English and Amer- 
icans were getting nearer to each other and that he expected 
they were now one people, and that as soon as he heard any 
news he would let him know it, the conversation with Gov- 
ernor Hull took place last Saturday the 20th Instant. I then 
came to the point and asked him his opinion if there should 

1. This letter, evidently in answer to that of Harrison, Feb. 18, has neither sig- 
nature nor date. It appears to be a mere memorandum on the back of the Harrison 
letter for the direction of the clerk in answering Harrison. It must have been written 
as late as March 7 when the Harrison letter was received at Washington. 

1. Francis Gore had been superintendent of Indian affairs since 1796. He was 
stationed at that time on the Niagara frontier. 



 

be any disturbance between Great Britain & America, he said 
there were three Nations that spoke the same Language, the 
Ottawas Potawatamies and Chippewas that he heard that they 
had spoke often on that subject among themselves, and ex- 
pected that they would be called on by the King if a War took 
place between the two countries, but that they must sit quiet ; 
he continued & said, if the whole of the Nations were to talk 
together, that may not be the case, I told him that I hoped his 
idea of his friends would prove true if required, for that the 
King their Father had always shown a great regard for them 
& spared no expence to make them comfortable & that he 
would most certainly keep his eyes looking towards them. 

Two days ago I had a private meeting with the little King, 
an Ottawa Chief, from L'Arbre Croche, [on Little Traverse 
bay] and after talking some time I asked him the same ques- 
tion that I did Guyash (what was his opinion of the Indians 
if a disturbance took place between Great Britain & Amer- 
ica?) his reply was, the gi'ound is smooth yet, I pressd it again 
& his answer was, you will know if it happens. Your Ex- 
cellency knowns how cautious Indians are in general in giving 
their opinion, particularly on so delicate a matter, but from 
the manner in which he spoke it is easily to be understood 
that he considers the Indians decidedly opposed to the Amer- 
icans. With the eKception of the Hurouns, who are very few, 
those two are the only men on the ground that I would speak 
to in confidence the rest are a very indifferent set. The Little 
King's Band, present, only 11 men, are very respectable In- 
dians & appear to be most completely under his control. 

The season for boiling Sugar is now arrived & the whole are 
pressing me very hard to return to their sugar Bush and to 
give them clothing as they have been kept here the whole 
winter, which has prevented them from hunting ; I do not see 
how it is possible to keep them here without a verj^ great ex- 
pence indeed; I am obliged to give them this day, what 
presents remain in store, & if I was to detain them Just now, 
they would look for payment for the loss of the sugar season, 
and make a claim on Government for bread, from a pretence 
of losing the opportunity of preparing the ground for their 
corn, I shall use every endeavor in my power to detain some of 
the young men, those with families will go and it is more than 
probable that they will not return before the latter end of 
April or May. 



 

I cannot discover that the American Government have had 
any public or private meeting with the Indians, except the one 
of the 4th Novr last, with Governor Hull for the purpose of 
making a purchase of land which has caused much dissatisfac- 
tion among the several Nations between this Post & Lake 
Michigan, in my opinion it will not be settled without the loss 
of some lives. 

I cannot close my letter without expressing my thanks to 
Your Excellency for Captain [Matthew] Elliott's assistance, 
which I have found of great use on several occasions. 

with much respect I have the honor to be Your Excellencies 
most obedient and most humble Servant

Sir, 

The indisposition of Captain Johnny the Shawanese chief 
prevented me from seeing him on business untill this day, he 
still continues very ill, but his people being anxious to return 
hom, induced me to go to their quarter & I there spoke to him 
on the situation of public affairs. 

I cannot find out that any communication has been made to 
any of the Indian Nations by the American Government re- 
specting the difference between Great Britain and America. 

The enclosed is what was said to Capt. Johnny in the pres- 
sence of Blackbear and the Buffaloe, Capt Elliot was present 
& I was obliged to employ James Girty' as my Interpreter as 
I had done on former occasions Fisher not having yet arrived. 

I am rather disappointed at not hearing from you, particu- 
larly as you promised me that once a week at least you would 
send, I have been here seven weeks & not one message yet, 
I have wrote twise officially to the Governor & twice to you, 

2. William Glaus was in general charge of Indian affairs of Upper Canada. His 
field reached down the Mississippi to St. Louis. 

1. James Girty was a Pittsburg trader at the beginning of the Revolution. He 
with his brothers George and Simon joined the British. He owned a farm near 
Amherstburg.

probably I have erred in writing to the Governor instead of 
its going through, which enduces me now to transmit the en- 
closed to you, that you may lay the same before His Excel- 
lency. 

No doubt but His Excellency must see some necessity for 
my stay here, or I should have received directions to return 
before now. The number of Indians victualed now amounts 
to 259 men, women, & children, & many of them go off tomor- 
row the Shawnese also.

Report on Division of Indiana Territory

That the petitioners^ state many inconveniences, hardships, 
and privations, as well as the discouragement of emigration 
into their country, under which they labor, in consequence of 
a connexion which they call unnatural, between the two very 
distant settlements, whose country, by the compact between 
the United States and the State of Virginia, is ordained to 
constitute two separate and distinct States. 

Among the disadvantages, they state that the inhabitants of 
their two large and populous counties are subject to be called 
from one hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty miles 
through a wilderness (which, for want of wood and living 
water, must long remain dreary and difficult to pass through) 
to attend as suitors, witnesses, &c., as the general court, which 
is held at Vincennes, has cognizance of every matter in con- 
troversy exceeding the value of fifty dollars. 

They state, also, that the country, wich is to constitute the 
Eastern State, having three-fifths of the representation in the 
Territorial Legislature, with all the officers for the admin- 
istration of the Territorial Government, appointed by the 
President of the United States, they who live in the country 
which is to constitute the Western State, are oppressed with

6, 1808, by Nathaniel Lyons, and referred to the following committee: Nathaniel Lyons 
of Ky., Benjamin Parke of Ind., Francis Gardner of N. H., Killian K. van Rensselaer 
of N. Y., William Hoge of Pcnn., Adam Boyd of N. J. and Josiah Dean of Mass. The

taxes, the avails thereof are expended in the country which is 
to form the Eastern State, and at the discretion of those over 
whom they can have no control. They pray for a dissolution 
of this connexion, and the establishment of a new Territorial 
Government consisting of the country, which, by the compact, 
is designated for the Western State, as it is marked out on the 
map of the United States. 

The committee, however, considering the press of important 
business which must occupy the attention of the National Leg- 
islature, during the short time proposed for the continuance of 
the session, the unpromising aspect of our fiscal concerns, and 
particularly the impolicy of increasing the number of Terri- 
torial Governments without its being manifestly necessary, 
are of opinion that it is inexpedient, at this time to grant the 
prayer of the petitioners.

Sir: 

I left Vincennes a few days ago and the day before my de- 
partune a young man from the Delawares Towns came to 
inform me that a Potawatime Indian had arrived at the Towns 
with a speech from the British in which they were informed 
that they (The British) were upon the point of commencing 
hostilities against the United States and requesting the Dela- 
wares to join them. The latter gave a flat refusal and de- 
clared their determination to adhere to the United States. I 
am endeavouring to make the friendly Tribes enter into an 
association to oblige the others to keep the peace. Unless we 
have a law which will prevent white persons from going into 
and residing in the Indian country we will have it filled with 
British agents, who will constantly counteract us.

Sir, 

Mr. Fisher, whose receipts to the 25th March last I now en- 
close, arrived here on the 22d ulto. he brings nothing new 
with him but what I have mentioned on a former occasion — 
the Language of the American Govt, to the Indians, to sit 
quiet in case of hostilities. 

There is little doubt in my mind of the weight it has with 
them, owing to the very weak state of this country, it makes 
them extremely cautious. The Prophet has moved to the Wa- 
bashe with his people, nearly eighty men. he expects a visit 
from thirty different nations from the Southward and West- 
ward of the Mississippi. I reed, a message from him through 
Fisher assuring me of his friendship, I find the cause of his 
not coming in when I sent for him with the Shawanese Chiefs, 
was owing to a little jealously between him and those chiefs. 
I understand that Mr. McDonald has left a packet for me at 
Mr. Dalsons which he brought from York, I have sent over 
for it. 

Everji;hing appears perfectly quiet among the Indians. 
Your obedt. Sert.

Sir: 

The Shawnese imposter [The Prophet] has acquired such 
an ascendency over the minds of the Indians that there can 
be little doubt of their pursuing any course which he may dic- 
tate to them, and that his views are decidedly hostile to the 
United States is but too evident. I had a very considerable 
confidence in the Delawares and Miamis to resist his designs, 
but a late circumstance has convinced me that altho they may 
not be converted to his divine mission they are under the 
greatest apprehensions of his temporal power. (The Prophet 



 

has selected a spot on the upper part of the Wabash [Tippe- 
canoe] for his future and permanent residence and had en- 
gaged a considerable number of Potawatimies, Ottawas, 
Chippewas and other northern Indians to settle there under 
his auspices.) This circumstance so alarmed the Miamis and 
Delawares that they resolved to defeat the measure at any 
risk and the Chiefs of the latter set out to inform him of their 
determination. The Prophet would not however deign them 
an interview but dispatched his brother to meet them whose 
threats or whose persuasions were sufficient to drive back the 
chiefs with some indications of apprehension and terror. 
Fi'om the latest information it appears also that the Delawares 
were in a state of considerable alarm. Altho the council of 
their chiefs had but a short time ago directed the warriors to 
prevent the Prophet from approaching the Wabash. 

I have lately conversed with an intelligent man who passed 
(a few weeks ago) through some of the villages of the Pota- 
watimies that are under the Prophet's influence. He says that 
they are constantly engaged in what they term religious 
duties. But that their prayers are always succeeded by or 
intermixed with warlike sports, shooting with the bow, throw- 
ing the tomahawk or wielding the war club. This combina- 
tion of Religious and warlike exercise and the choice of weap- 
ons of their own manufacture sufficiently indicates the designs 
of their author. 

I most sincerely wish the President would think himself 
authorized to have him seized and conveyed to the interior of 
the United States until the present appearance of war is re- 
moved. 

I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Sir your

Honorable HENRY DEARBORN Secretary at War 

The Prophet to Harrison 

June 24th 1808 

Har. Pa. 219-225 

My Father The paper which I now deliver to you is the 
speech you sent to us by [John] Connor ; [Sept. 5, 1807] when 
it was delivered we were surprised to find that we had been so 



 

much misrepresented. The chief, the prophet had sent us to 
speak to you in his name. 

My Father. It never was my intention to lift up my hand 
against the Americans; on the contrary we had determined 
to follow the advice of the great Spirit, who has told us that 
our former conduct is not right ; that we ought to live in peace 
upon the land he has given us. This is our positive determina- 
tion and we are resolved not to listen any longer to bad advice. 

My Father you have always told us to let you know what is 
done amongst us and I now inform you that I sent you word 
by Connor, that we were shortly to move to the Wabash, we 
have lately done this and I now send some of my chiefs to visit 
you and to inform that the bad reports you have heard of me 
are all false and beg you not to believe them. 

My Father. As a proof of our sincerity we have brought 
our women and children to reside near you. I am now very 
much engaged in making my new settlement but as soon as 
it is completed I will pay you a visit and hope to remove every 
bad impression you have received against me. 

Father- I hope what I now say will be engraven on your 
heart. It is my determination to obey the voice of great spirit 
and live in peace with you and your people. I do not mean to 
do anything to risk the safety of our children, but on the con- 
trary to multiply them as much as possible. This is what the 
Great Spirit has told us repeatedly. We are all made by him, 
although we differ a little in colour. We are all his children 
and should live in peace and friendship with each other. 

Father. Believe what I say, it is the truth. The Great 
Spirit has told us not to lie you must know that I did not make 
my own Head and Tongue, they were made by the Great Spirit 
and that I cannot lie without offending him. 

Father. In consequence of our removal we are in great 
distress. We hope that you will assist our women and chil- 
dren with a little corn. We are now planting and hope to 
have a plenty when it is ripe. 

Speech of the Shawnees Prophet to Govr. Harrison 

Harrison to the Prophet 

My Children. I have listened to the speech you brought 
to me from the Shawnee chief or prophet and now return you 



 

my answer, to which I request you to pay particular atten- 
tion that you may truly repeat it to him. It is true that I 
have heard a very bad report of you, not only the white people 
in your country but many of the Tribes your neighbours have 
taken up very unfavorable opinions of your intentions. It is 
believed by them that you are endeavouring to alienate the 
minds of the Indians, from their great Father, the President 
of the 17 fires, and once more to bring them under the in- 
fluence of the British and I must confess that I have myself 
given credit to this report. But the solemn assurance which 
you now give me that you have no other object but that of 
making your people happy and live in peace with all man- 
kind have in a great measure removed my prejudices and if 
your subsequent conduct agrees with your present profes- 
sions you may rest satisfied that you will continue to enjoy 
the lavor and protection of the 17 fires. Very dift'erent how- 
ever will be your lot if you permit yourselves to be seduced 
by the British agents. By those enemies to your repose and 
happiness who have as often deceived you and led you into 
difficulties and dangers. You need only to recollect their 
conduct to you during the last war [Wayne's Campaign] in 
which you were engaged with the 17 fires to laiow the man- 
ner in which you will be treated should you again open your 
ears to their council. 

It was by their persuasions that you took up the tomahawk 
but they abandoned you as soon as distress came upon you 
and left you to the mercy of those very enemies whom you 
had provoked and, angered to gratify their revenge and 
malice. How dift'erent has been the conduct of the chief of 
the 17 fires towards you. Like a true Father he watches 
over your happiness and gives you the same advice that you 
say you have received from the great spirit that is to have 
pity on your women and children and live in peace with all 
mankind. War he detests and never engages in it, but in 
his own defence nor will he ever condescend to ask assistance 
of his children confident in his own strength and knowing 
the calamity which war always brings on those who engage 
in it without sufficient cause, he is desirous that his children 
should remain at peace in their cabbins If any of the na- 
tions which reside beyond the great lake waters should pro- 
voke him to war he is sufficiently able to punish them. He 
wants the aid of no power on earth and relies on his own 



 

strength and the favor of the great spirit who always takes 
the side of the injured. 

Your Father the president will be much pleased when he 
hears your determination to consider his protection and to 
shut your ears against the bad talks of the people on the 
other side of the great lakes and I shall take care to express 
to him my belief in your sincerity. But I must candidly in- 
form you that it is his positive determination in any case of 
the Tribes who became his children at The Treaty of Green- 
ville should lift up the Tomahawk against him that he will 
never again make peace as long as there is one of that Tribe 
on this side of the Lakes. He gives them their free choice 
either to live by his side in peace and happiness and receive 
from him every necessary aid for providing a comfortable 
and certain subsistance for their women and children or all 
the calamities which the number and strength of his warriors 
would enable him to inflict I do not say this with an inten- 
tion to insult you. I know that the Shawnees and other Tribes 
which have joined you are brave warriors but the long knives 
are not less brave and you know their numbers are as the 
blades of grass or the grains of sand on the river shore. Be 
wise then and show the people who are endeavouring to seduce 
you that you have sense enough to distinguish the path that 
leads to happiness from that which would conduct you to 
certain misery and ruin. 

With respect to your religious opinions they shall never be 
the cause of dissention and difference between us. The mild 
religion which we possess will not permit us to use any other 
means than argument and reason to induce others to adopt 
our opinions and it is an inviolable rule with the 17 fires to 
permit every man to worship the great spirit in the manner 
he may think best. I shall say nothing upon the subject of 
your settlement on the Wabash, as that country is the prop- 
erty of the Miamies, we do not wish to interfere with you. 

The bearer of the prophet's speech then addressing Gov- 
ernor Harrison said : 

Father. When I return to my village vdth your answer 
every woman and child will rejoice to find that you are still 
their friend. 

(Upon being questioned by the Governor as to the religious 
opinions and pretentions of the chief or Prophet he said) 



 

"I have now listened to that man upwards of three years and 
have never heard him give any but good advice. He tells us 
that we must pray to the great spirit who made the world 
and everything in it for our use. He tells us that no man 
could make the Trees and the plants and the animals but that 
they must be made by the great spirit to whom we ought to 
pray and obey in all things. He tells us not to lie to steal or 
to drink whiskey not to go to war but to live in peace with 
all mankind. He tells us also to work and make corn. (The 
Governor having offered him some hoes and a plough he 
said) Father you can give us nothing that will be acceptable 
to us, we are now not ashamed to work and make corn for 
our women and children.

Sir: 

I have lately received a deputation from the Shawnese 
prophet with a very pacific and concilitary speech [June 24, 
above] a copy of which with my answer [June 24, above] is 

1. This election was held July 25. Rice Jones, son of John Rice Jones, was elected 
from Randolph county and John Messinger, a son-in-law of the famous Nathaniel Lyons, 
from St. aalr. 



 

herewith enclosed. The bearer of this message complained 
most bitterly of the misrepresentations which have been cir- 
culated relative to the prophet's views and his disposition 
towards us. He is shortly to visit me and I shall take the 
opportunity to endeavour to develop his character and inten- 
tions nor do I think it at all impossible to make him an use- 
ful instrument in effecting a radical and salutary change in 
the manners and habits of the Indians. He has already 
gained two very important points towards the accomplish- 
ment of this desirable object. His followers drink no whiskey 
and are no longer ashamed to cultivate the earth. [See 
August 1, below] 

Altho I have not received any instructions from the presi- 
dent directly or from your Department I have in consequence 
of an application from Governor [Meriwether] Lewis [Mis- 
souri] (and under the belief that he had been instructed on 
the subject) informed the several tribes in this territory who 
have heretofore been inimical to the Osages that the United 
States would no longer protect that tribe and would oppose 
no obstacle to any hostile enterprises which might be under- 
taken against them. This intimation has been joyfully re- 
ceived and I have reason to believe that the Osages will be 
attacked in the Fall by a force that they will not be able to 
resist.

1. John Rice Jones was born in Wales, Feb. 10. 1759. He was a college graduate in

died in ofiBce in 1824. He and Harrison were warm friends but parted when Jones 
became interested in land speculation.

them is really one of the most abandoned men I ever knew. 
You will no doubt be surprised at this declaration when you 
recollect that he holds his appointment as a member of the 
Legislative Council by my recommendation. This is indeed 
a circumstance of Infinite Mortification to me & I can only 
comfort myself with the reflection that I was imposed on, 
in common with many others who ought to have known him 
better. The truth is, that he conducted himself with so much 
art that nineteen twentieths of the people of this County had 
designated him for the Council. His talents are unquestion- 
able — And he had taken so decided a part in favor of the 
second Government altho one of the largest landholders in 
the Territory, & altho a professed Federalist had manifested 
so much Moderation that it appeared to me that he could not 
with Justice be neglected in the arrangement of officers con- 
sequent upon the change of System. He has lately been In- 
dicted by the Grand Jury of this County for receiving Bribes 
in two instances when he acted as Attorney General to dis- 
miss prosecutions which he had commenced on the part of 
the Territory. I have enclosed a statement of the case made 
by the present Atty. Genl. Mr [Thomas] Randolph. = 

I trust my dear Sir that you entertain such an opinion of 
my Candor & attachment to you as to believe that I would 
not willingly be the means of inducing you to commit am im- 
proper act. But I do most sincerely think that the removal 
of Jones from his seat in the Council would be attended with 
highly salutary consequences to the United States as well as 
to the Territory. 

We shall have a number of Candidates for the appointment 
of Delegate to Congress. The devisions which the parties will 
take are, those for & those who are opposed to the Devision 
of the Territory & those who favor the admission of Negroes 
& those who are against it. I have some expectation that 
Mr Thos. Randolph from Virga whom I have appointed to 
succeed Mr [Benjamin] Parke as Atty. General will also suc- 
ceed him as Deligate & I am certain that nothing will prevent 
it but the short time he has been in the Territory. 

Until a few months ago I have believed that Davis Floyd 

2. Thomas Randolph became attorney general June 2, 1808 ; was horn in Va. 
1771 : graduated from William and Mary, a member of the famous Randolph family. 
He and Harrison were wai-m friends. He served as attorney general till his death 
on the battle field of Tippecanoe, Nov. 7, 1811. He, Col White and Jo. Daviess were 
great masonic friends and all were buried together. Esarey, Courts and Lawiier$, index 



 

was no farther engaged in Burrs Conspiracy than he acknowl- 
edged to have been in the Statement he made after his return 
& which was forwarded by me to the Secretary of State in 
the Spring of 1807. I have lately however discovered that 
besides the circumstances mentioned by Mr [George] Poin- 
dexter [of Mississippi Ter.] in his Testimony on Burrs

We whose names are hereunto aflixed most respectfully rep- 
resent to the President of the United States, that in our opin- 
ions, it would be highly proper to remove John Rice Jones 
from his appointment as a member of the Legislative Coun- 
cil of the Indiana Territory. His whole conduct since his 
appointment to that office, having manifested a total absence 
of moral & Political virtue & a most rancorous enmity, both 
to the administration of the General Government & that of 
the Territory.

Father : 

It is three years since I first began with that system of 
religion which I now practise. The white people and some 
of the Indians were against me; but I had no other inten- 
tion but to introduce among the Indians, those good princi- 
ples of religion which the white people profess. I was spoken 
badly of by the white people, who reproached me with mis- 
leading the Indians ; but I defy them to say that I did any- 
thing amiss. 

Father, I was told that you intended to hang me. When I 
heard this, I intended to remember it, and tell my father, 
when I went to see him and relate to him the truth. I heard, 
when I settled on the Wabash, that my father, the Governor 
had declared that all the land between Vincennes and Fort 
Wayne was the property of the Seventeen Fires. I also 
heard that you wanted to know, my father, whether I was 
God or man ; and that you said, if I was the former, I should 
not steal horses. I heard this from Mr. Wells, but I believe 
it originated with himself. The Great Spirit told me to tell 
the Indians, that he had made them and the world — that he 
had placed them on it to do good, and not evil. I told all the 
red skins that the way they were in was not good, and that 
they ought to abandon it. That we ought to consider our- 
selves as one man, but we ought to live agreeable to our 
several customs, the red people after their mode and the 
white people after theirs; particularly, that they should not 
drink whiskey, that it was not made for them, but the white 
people, who alone know how to use it; and that it is the 

1807; aid to Harrison at Tippecanoe and durinK the War of 1812. In 1816 he became

cause of all the mischiefs which the Indians suffer ; and that 
they must always follow the directions of the Great Spirit 
and we must listen to him, as it was he that has made us. 

Determine to listen to nothing that is bad. Do not take 
up the tomahawk, should it be offered by the British, or by 
the long knives. Do not meddle with anything that does not 
belong to you, but mind your own business, and cultivate the 
ground, that your women and your children may have enough 
to live on. I now inform you that it is our intention to live 
in peace with our father and his people for ever. 

My father, I have informed you what we mean to do, and 
I call the Great Spirit to witness the truth of my declara- 
tion. The religion which I have established for the last three 
years, has been attended to by the different tribes of Indians 
in this part of the world. Those Indians were once different 
people; they are now but one; they are all determined to 
practice what I have communicated to them, that has come 
immediately from the Great Spirit through me. 

Brother, I speak to you as a warrior. You are one. But 
let us lay aside this character, and attend to the care of our 
children, that they may live in comfort and peace. We desire 
that you will join us for the preservation of both red and 
white people. Formerly, when we lived in ignorance, we were 
foolish; but now, since we listen to the voice of the Great 
Spirit, we are happy. 

I have listened to what you have said to us. You have 
promised to assist us. I now request you, in behalf of all 
the red people, to use your exertions to prevent the sale of 
liquor to us. We are all well pleased to hear you say that 
you will endeavor to promote our happiness. We give you 
every assurance that we will follow the dictates of the Great 
Spirit. 

We are all well pleased with the attention that you have 
showed us; also \vith the good intentions of our father, the 
president. If you give us a few articles, such as needles, 
flints, hoes, powder, etc. etc. we vdll take the animals that 
afford us meat with powder and ball.^

Sir: 

Painful necessity obliges us to announce to you that John 
Campbell, Esq. late Indian agent at La Prairie du Chiene is 
no more. On Friday last he and a Mr. Redford Crawford, 
one of the Macinac Company met on an island near British 
St. Joseph's to settle an affair of honor which unhappily 
eventuated in the death of Mr. Campbell. 

This information is communicated as much from an eye to 
the interest of our government as in compliance with his wish 
expressed before he left this island and reiterated on his 
death bed. He also requested us in case the affair alluded to 
should terminate unfortunately for him that we would solicit 
a Mr. [Julien] Du Bugne' at the Lead mines twenty leagues 
below the Wisconsin on the Mississippi to discharge the duties 
of Indian Agent in his stead until the Government shall ap- 
point another. And likewise observed that he knew no man 
better qualified for this office of Indian agent for that coun- 
try than Mr. DuB. and that it was his fervent wish for the 
interest of the United States Mr. DuBugne should receive that 
appointment. 

We shall immediately write to Mr. DuBugne on the subject. 

Mr. Campbell expired on the night of the 13th inst. 

With great esteem. Sir your obt. servt.

P. S. It is believed proper to inform you also that the In- 
dian traders from this country have none of them obtained 
licenses. Mr. Campbell notified the Macinac Company of his 
authority on that subject and offered licences free of expence. 
The Company refused and neglected applying, alledging that 
they deemed it unnecessary to have licenses when they held 
a clearance from the Collector of their district altho' informed

Sir: 

The celebrated Shawnese Prophet has just left me after a 
visit of more than two weeks. He is rather possessed of con- 
siderable talents and the art and address with which he man- 
ages the Indians is really astonishing. I was not able to 
ascertain whether he is, as I at first supposed, a tool of the 
British or not. His denial of being under any such influence 
was strong and apparently candid. He says that his sole pur- 
pose is to reclaim the Indians from the bad habits they have 
contracted and to cause them to live in Peace and friendship 
with all mankind and declares that he is particularly in- 
structed to that eft'ect by the great spirit. He frequently 
harangued his followers in my presence and the evils attend- 
ant upon war and the use of ardent spirit was his constant 
theme. I cannot say how successful he may be in persuading 
them to lay aside their passion for war but the experiment 
made to determine whether their refusal to drink whiskey pro- 
ceeded from principle or was only empty profession, estab- 
lished the former beyond all doubt 

Upon the whole Sir I am inclined to think that the influence 
which the Prophet has acquired will prove rather advan- 
tageous than otherwise to the United States. [See the 
Prophet's talk, Aug. 1, above] 

I have the honor to be with the greatest respect Sir your 
Humble Servant.

DELA WARES TO HARRISON 

White River, Sept. 9, 1808 

Dawson, Harrison, 110, 111 

Father — 

Attend to the' advice of your children, the head warriors of 
the Delaware nation, who reside along this river. We think 
it our duty to inform you (of) the business which we lately 
undertake (undertook) with regard of (to) the tomahawk. 
We have consult (consulted) with the head warriors of the 
Miamis, who seem afraid to take (up) the tomahawk, and 
would rather act as little children, only looking on their grand- 
fathers. They are waiting till all the other nations take it 
up, then they must of course take it up too. The head war- 
riros of (the) Potawatamies have sent word to us that they 
are preparing for (to) march against (the) Osages. 

We have been carry (carrying) the tomahawk to the 
Shawanese and Wyandots, who (are) fond of war. They 
both took it up and would sharpened, (sharpen it) but could 
not started (start) this fall, and finally agreed to put it off 
till next spring; at which time the whole confederate nations 
will be ready to march, that we may cut off our enemy with 
one stroke. 

The Wyandots undertake to send runners to notify (the) 
Chippewa, Ottawa, and the rest of the nations. 

Father, our friend, the bearer, from beyond (the) Missis- 
sippi, will deliver this letter to you. We wish you to furnish 
him with provisions, powder and lead, and some clothing. 

Father, one word yet. All our allies in this part of the 
country have jointly request (requested of) you this one 
thing — that is, we wish you to prohibit all your traders along 
the Mississippi from selling arms and ammunition to our com- 
mon enemy, (the) Osages; for we have been inform (in- 
formed) that they have frequently come to those French trad- 
ers, and beg for such articles, whereby they have been enabled 
to do more mischief ; and if your traders should furnish them 
with such articles since we proclaim (proclaimed) war against 
that nation, it will, of course, as it were, strengthen our enemy, 
while we profess to be friends of the United States, ; there- 



 

fore we entreat you to listen, and consider what we have to 

say.^

Annual Message, Second Session, Second Assembly 

September 27, 1808 

Vincennes Western Sun, October 1, 1808 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and Gentlemen of the 
Hotise of Representatives: 

The appointment of our delegate to Congress [Benjamin 
Parke] , to a seat on the supreme Judiciary bench of the Terri- 
tory ; has occasioned my calling you together at an earlier pe- 
riod than that which was assigned at the close of the last 
session. To accommodate the gentlemen who manage their 
own farms, I have barely allowed time for a deliberate choice 
of a person to represent you, and for his arrival at the seat 
of the national government by the time fixed for the meeting 
of Congress. 

In my address at the opening of the last session, I requested 
your attention to certain subjects which appear to me to re- 
quire legislative provision ; and to such of them as have not 
been acted upon I reiterate my recommendation for an early 
notice. Amongst these the revenue and militia laws (from 
their superior importance) deserve a very particular and criti- 
cal examination. 

That the former is inadequate to its object is evident from 
the emptiness of the treasury. Nor is there the least reason 
to doubt that this proceeds from the mode of collection rather 
than the height of the tax, or inability of the people to pay it. 
It is believed that the adoption of the system which has for 
many years been successfully used in the neighboring states 
would remove every difficulty, and place our revenue beyond 
the reach of those accidents and contingencies which have 
hitherto embarrassed it. 

1. This letter was written for the Indians by some trader, very probably John 
Connor. The words in parenthesis were supplied by Dawson. 



 

The militia, at all times a subject of importance, is pecu- 
liarly so at the present crisis, uncertain as we are at what 
moment its services may be necessary. Constituting as it 
does the principal defence of our rights and sovereignty, no 
labor or expense can be misapplied which has a tendency to 
perfect its organization and dicipline. Amongst the defects 
of the present law, I have particularly noticed its want of 
coercion to produce the returns and reports which it directs to 
be made. The regularity of these constitute the most essen- 
tial feature of a military body; and until they are properly 
understood and attended to, no great progress can be made in 
any other part of the military art. I would recommend a 
certain and severe punishment to such officers, particularly of 
the higher grades, as shall neglect this important duty. 

As far as my own observation and information extends, it 
appears that there exists a very general (and I believe just) 
complaint, against the height of the taxes collected under the 
denomination of county levies. The tax on cattle and work 
horses is peculiarly objectionable, as it subjects the poor to an 
unequal share of the public burdens. The milk of neat cattle 
forming the principal food of the poorer classes of our fellow 
citizens, it appears to me that a tax upon the animal that 
produces it is quite as improper as a tax on any other article 
of general necessity. Two modes of remedying the evil pre- 
sent themselves to your consideration : by abolishing alto- 
gether some of those claims by which the county treasuries 
are exhausted, or by transferring others to the general terri- 
torial fund. It appears to me that both these plans may be 
adopted with propriety. Upon examining the county treas- 
urers' accomts, it will appear that a considerable sum is 
yearly appropriated in each county to compensate the sur- 
veyors of the roads. The opening of roads is certainly a mat- 
ter of considerable consequence ; but as this is always done by 
the labor of each individual citizen, and not by contract, I 
could never learn what public advantage has ever resulted 
from surveying them. The law as it stands, however, makes 
it the duty of courts to have it done. If there were no other 
reason for compensating the judges of the courts of common 
pleas out of the Territorial treasury, the gi-eat inequality of 
the counties in wealth and population would be a sufficient 
one ; but when it is recollected that the proposed change would 
greatly relieve the poor without oppressing the rich, that it 



 

would take the burden from the shoulders of the man who 
has nothing and add a mite only to the contributions of the 
wealthy — in a word that it might render unnecessary the poll 
tax on indigent young men, on work horses, and oxen, and on 
the food which nourishes that part of the rising generation 
which is to constitute the strength and defence of our coun- 
try — the measure would appear to combine justice with pol- 
icy. 

The frequent occurence of horse stealing along the south- 
eastern boundary of the Territory makes an enquiry into the 
competency of the law upon that subject worthy your atten- 
tion. This nefarious practice is said to have produced great 
distress and inconvenience to some of our citizens, by depriv- 
ing them of the means of cultivation at the most critical season 
of the year. Could we command the funds necessary for the 
support of that humane institution [penitentiary] which is in 
use in several of the States, the object of which is by a course 
of moderate labor and solitary confinement to restrain the 
vicious and restore them to habits of industry and usefulness, 
I should be amongst Ihe first to advocate its adoption. As 
this is not, however, within our means, we must postpone the 
accomplishment of our wishes on this subject to the period 
when the increased wealth and population of our Territory 
will justify the measure. In the meantime it is our duty to 
protect the property of our fellow citizens by providing ade- 
quate punishment for the repeated depredations that are com- 
plained of and which it appears our present laws are insuflS- 
cient to restrain. 

If the proceedings of the court of Chancery, gentlemen, have 
until lately been slow and dilatory, it ought to be attributed 
to its true cause — the want of compensation to its officers. 
It cannot be supposed that they will give their time and talents 
to the public, and perform the laborious duties required of 
them, without remuneration. With respect to the usefulness 
of the court, and the propriety of its being continued, my own 
opinion is fixed and decided. If ever there was a country 
where a court of Chancery was necessary, ours is the one; be- 
cause in no other (as I believe) has there ever been so much 
valuable property transferred without the observance of the 
legal forms of conveyance, or where the evasion of the specific 
performance of contracts would produce so much confusion, 
injustice, and ruin. It is not many years since a bare assign- 



 

ment of title to lands upon a bit of paper, without any of those 
peculiar phrases which our laws require in the transfer of 
real property, was deemed both by the buyer and seller a suf- 
ficient conveyance. Indeed, there have been instances where 
the delivery of possession has been considered and accepted 
as sufiicient evidence of purchase. To enforce the observance 
of bona fide contracts made in this manner it is believed a 
court of Chancery is alone competent ; nor is it by any means 
that loose and fluctuating tribunal which some have consid- 
ered it, where will and not law presides, and where the arbi- 
trary opinion of the judge is the only rule of decision. It is, 
on the contrary, bound down by rules and laws as well de- 
fined, and as well understood, as those of any other court ; and 
as it compels the specific performance of contracts, and en- 
ables contending parties reciprocally to avail themselves of 
facts which might otherwise be forever buried in the bosoms 
of their opponents, it is peculiarly calculated to protect the 
simple and ignorant against the artful and designing. 

It gives me great pleasure to inform you, gentlemen, that 
there is every prospect of a continuance of that harmony and 
good understanding with our Indian neighbors which is so 
mutually beneficial and which it has been my constant en- 
deavor to preserve. I pronounce with confidence that at no 
anterior period have our relations with the neighboring tribes 
been placed upon a better footing, or on one which gives such 
just cause of exultation to the friends of that wise, humane, 
and beneficent policy which has been adopted by our govern- 
ment, and which forms so singular an exception to the treat- 
ment of savages by those who are called civilized. We can 
challenge the world to produce a similar instance of a great 
and powerful nation respecting on all occasions the rights of 
its weaker neighbors, and acquiring by fair, equal, and recip- 
rocally advantageous treaties that extension of territory 
which other nations have been accustomed to seize by violence. 
A course of conduct so difi'erent from that which they have 
experienced from other civilized powers has at length pro- 
duced amongst the Indians a thorough conviction that their 
prosperity and happiness can only be secured by presei'ving 
inviolate their connections with the United States. And as 
all the wars which have arisen between ourselves and the 
aborigines are justly attributable to the prevalence of foreign 
influence amongst the latter, we may fairly calculate that our 



 

Indian frontier will be free from those alarms and apprehen- 
sions which have had so much effect in retai-ding its 
settlement. 

The laws of Congress for the disposal of the public lands 
in the Territory having directed a section to be reserved in 
each township for the support of schools, it may be proper, 
Gentlemen, at the present session, to make some provision for 
securing this precious deposit from depredation, and putting 
it in a state of progressive improvement. 

With these observations, gentlemen, which relate to subjects 
connected with your immediate duty, I might leave you to your 
deliberations; but on an occasion of this kind, addressing a 
respectable and organized body of my fellow citizens, it is im- 
possible that I should not recollect, and recollecting that I 
should pass unnoticed, the critical and unprecedented situa- 
tion of our national affairs. 

It is true that in this infant state of our political existence 
we have no voice in the councils of the nation, but we are 
nevertheless Americans; and as such feelingly alive to every- 
thing which can effect the interest of our common country. 
If a uniform course of justice, moderation, and forbearance 
towards the belligerent powers of Europe could have preserved 
to us a continuance of that peace which is so ardently desired 
by all classes of our fellow citizens, America might fairly 
calculate upon an exemption from those evils which are the 
inevitable consequences of war. Such however seems not to 
be our lot. The storm which has been so long lowering at a 
distance, and which has spread such havock and destruction 
over the fairest portion of the creation, has assumed a direc- 
tion which menaces our peaceful and happy shores. If it is 
yet possible to divert this force without a prostration of na- 
tional honor; if it is possible to procrastinate the appeal to 
arms even for a single day ; such is the moderation of our 
government, and such its policy, that we may be certain at 
least of enjoying that day in peace. We shall "drain the cup 
of conciliation to the dregs", and not unsheath the sword until 
every expedient which the wisdom and experience of our rul- 
ers shall suggest shall have been tried in vain. 

If some of these measures are attended with temporary dis- 
tress and inconvenience, let it be remembered that the alter- 
native was war. If by a voluntary act of our own we have 
abandoned the ocean to our rivals and cut off our trade with 



 

every part of the world, in the event of war nearly the same 
result would have been produced by the superior fleets of our 
enemies, if Britain was to be our antagonist, or by the in- 
fluence of France upon the continent of Europe, if it should 
be our fate to contend with her. There is this essential dif- 
ference, however, between the two cases. In the one the im- 
mense property which we had exposed upon the ocean would 
have been captured, and would have afi'orded our enemies 
additional means of annoying us. The embai'go has preserved 
it to our own use, and our gallant seamen, instead of languish- 
ing in European dungeons, are safe, in their native harbors, 
waiting the signal which calls them to avenge their country's 
wi'ongs. Considered as a eommercial regulation to counter- 
vail the iniquitous and arbitrary orders in council and decrees 
of the belligerents, the wisdom of the embargo is equally mani- 
fest. Like every other species of warfare, this commercial 
contest may prove injurious to both parties; but that it will 
injure our antagonist most is evident from the very nature of 
our former intercourse. For our provisions and raw mate- 
rials for their manufactures, hemp and tar for their navies, 
we receive in return either articles of luxury, or such as with 
little exertion we can make for ourselves. Possessing within 
her owTi bosom all the comforts, conveniencies, and many of 
the luxuries of life, America should be as independent of for- 
eign labor as she is of foreign government. Like the coun- 
try of Confucius, she might form a world to herself. From 
Europe we have nothing to learn that is worth the least risk 
to acquire. Her sciences and arts have long been trans- 
planted amongst us, and the vigor of their growth proclaims 
them already naturalized. The adoption of her manners could 
add nothing to our happiness, and being inconsistent with the 
simplicity of republicanism might gradually undermine the 
fair fabrick of our government. And who can tell but that a 
wise and beneflcent Providence might have ordained the pres- 
ent suspension of intercourse to wean us from the contami- 
nating influence of foreign manners and opinions, that we 
might transmit our republican institutions in a pure and un- 
sullied stream to the latest generations? 

Until the present crisis, no circumstance has occured since 
the formation of our constitution which made it necessary 
for the government to adopt any rigorous measure, or to re- 
strain the people in the enjoyment of all those blessings which 



 

a state of peace and prosperity afforded. The embargo law 
is, however, of this description ; and the enemies of our gov- 
ernment have expressed the fondest hopes that the impatience 
of the people, under the deprivations it occasions, would com- 
pel a repeal of it before it could produce the effects its authors 
had intended. An event of this kind would be deplorable in- 
deed, nor would its pernicious consequences be confined to the 
present age and generation. The most specious objection 
which has been urged against republican governments is the 
want of consistency and the necessary energy in times of 
difficulty and danger. If America should abandon the ground 
she has taken on account of any trivial inconveniences which 
a suspension of foreign commerce produces, what exultation 
would it occasion to the advocates of monarchy and aris- 
tocracy, and what endless humiliation to the friends of repub- 
licanism! But I cannot believe it possible that the same 
people who, in a seven-years war, encountered with heroic 
fortitude all the calamities and hardships which an enemy 
superior in everything but valor could inflict, have become so 
fond of the luxuries and gewgaws of Europe as to submit 
to the humiliating conditions which are at present annexed 
to their enjoyment. 

However foreign this subject may be to your official duties, 
gentlemen, you may nevertheless, as influential individuals, 
render essential service to your fellow citizens by inculcating 
amongst them the propriety of adapting their habits and di- 
recting their exertions to suit the present situation of the 
country, and to meet the crisis which seems to be approach- 
ing. Industry and economy, at all times republican virtues, 
are now peculiarly requisite, and every exertion should be 
made to encourage domestic arts and manufactures for the 
supply of those articles of indispensable utility which we have 
been accustomed to receive from abroad. 

It may also be proper to impress upon the minds of your 
constituents that the Embargo is a measure of imperious ne- 
cessity, and produced by circumstances which the government 
could neither controul nor qualify.

The insolence of these foreigners is really intolerable. They 
have now a great number of traders in the Indian countiy 
who have no licences and who put our laws at defiance and 
it appears from the schedule of their goods entered at Mac- 
anac and transmitted to me by the collector that Ardent 
Spirits forms no small part of the cargoes of some of them. 

There is little doubt but Mr. Campbell fell a sacrifice to his 
zeal in the discharge of his duty. I know nothing of the 
Mr. Dobac [Julien Dubuque] whom he recommends as his 
successor.

Whereas by a law of the Territory it is declared that no 
person shall be elegable to a seat in either branch of the 
Legislature who holds a commission during pleasure directly 
under the United States or this Territory, and whereas upon 
examination of Robert A. Nue^ and Jonathan Jenings^ being 
first sworn, it appears to this House that Samuel Guathmey 

1. Robert A. New was an early resident of Jeffersonville. Along with Floyd he 
helped Burr procure supplies and recruits. He had charge of a boat. In 1816 he 
became the first secretary of state serving till 1825. Esarey, Indiana, index 

2. Jonathan Jennings was perhaps a Virginian, born about 1784. His father was 
an itinerant Presbyterian preacher. While a child he was taken to Penn. He spent 
some time in college but his education was meager. He came to Jeffersonville in 1805; 
to Vincennes in 1807 and plunged into politics. From 180S his political activities never 
ceased, as delegate to Cong., governor and congressman almost till his death. His 
ability was mediocre, except as a political politician where he was unsurpassed.

a member of the Legislative Council has accepted and now 
exercises the office of Register of the Land Office for the dis- 
trict of Jeffersonville whereby his seat has become vacated. 

Resolved therefore that this House in pursuance of the or- 
dinance do now proceed to nominate Two persons to be re- 
turned to the President of the United States, in order that 
he may appoint one of them to fill the place of the said Samuel 
Guathmey in the Legislative Council, and that the Speaker 
be and is hereby directed to transmit the same to the Presi- 
dent together with this resolution. 

Whereas Samuel Gwathmey, Srgt. as a Member of the Leg- 
islative Council of this Territory did (as has satisfactorily 
appeared to this House) in the month of August last, resign 
his seat as such member, and did (as was done in the case 
of Shadrach Bond, Senior, a Member of the Legislative Coun- 
cil from the County of St. Clair) transmit by the hand of the 
Honble. Waller Taylor to the Governor of this Territory 
(from whom he had received his Commission as such Coun- 
cillor by directions of the President of the United States) his 
resignation. 

And Whereas, this House, on the ninth day of its present 
session (being the fourth day of October instant) entered 
into the following Resolution 

Resolved that a Committee be appointed on the part of 
this House to wait on the Governor of this Territory and 
request information whether Samuel Gwathmey, Esquire, has 
resigned his seat as a member of the Legislative Council in 
order that this House may proceed to the nomination of fit 
persons to the President of the United States to fill the said 
vacancy — and that Messrs. [G. W.] Johnston and [John] 
Messenger be that Committee. The Committee named there- 
in, in virtue thereof waited upon the Governor, on the day 
of the passage thereof who returned them for answer "That 
he would answer the request of the House of Representa- 
tives in writing" and upon the following day being the fifth 
instant, he, by his Secretary Genl. [John] Gibson made this 
House the following answer "To the House of Representa- 
tives of the Indiana Territory, Gentlemen, the Legislative 
Council having requested me by a Resolution passed this day 
to send for their absent members, B. Chambers and Saml. 
Gwathmey, Esquires, I expect to be able in the course of a 
few days to give the House of Representatives some certain 



 

and definitive information upon the subject of the enquiry 
made of me yesterday relative to the last mentioned gentle- 
man" which answer this House immediately proceeded to con- 
sider of, and not conceiving the same either satisfactory or 
sufficient they entered into the following Resolutions Where- 
as, by a law of the Territory, it is declared that no person 
shall be eligible to a seat in either Branch of the Legislature 
who holds a Commission during pleasure directly under the 
United States or this, Territory ; and whereas upon examina- 
tion of Robert A. New and Jonathan Jennings, being first 
sworn, it appears to this House that Samuel Gwathmey a 
Member of the Legislative Council has accepted and now ex- 
ercises the office of Register of the Land Office for the Dis- 
trict of JefFersonville, whereby his seat has become vacated ; 
resolved therefore, that this House in pursuance of the Ordi- 
nance, do now proceed to nominate two persons to be returned 
to the President of the United States in order that he may 
appoint one of them to fill the place of the said Samuel 
Gwathmey in the Legislative Council, and that the Speaker 
be and he is hereby directed to transmit the same to the 
President by the ensuing mail together with this Resolution 
(which this House conceived itself authorized to do from the 
Revised Laws of the Territory page 241 being "A Law to 
regulate Elections in the 13th section whereof it is thus pro- 
vided "No Sheriff, under Sheriff", Clerk of any Court or per- 
son holding a Commission during pleasure directly under the 
States or this Territory except the Justices of the Peace and 
Militia Officers shall be eligible to a seat in either Branches 
of the Legislature") and the said nomination took place ac- 
cordingly, when Hugh McCalley and Charles Beggs were duly 
nominated as will appear by the nomination accompanying 
this R'^solve: 

And Whereas the Legislative Council, without being offi- 
cially informed of the above nomination have (from what 
cause this House will not express, but which the world easily 
can and the President of the United States may conjecture) 
entered into the following resolution — 

Whereas the Legislative Council have been informed that 
the House of Representatives have proceeded to the nomina- 
tion of two persons to be submitted to the President of the 
United States to fill the seat of Samuel Gwathney Esquire 
a Member of this House and have undertaken to examine 



 

witnesses at their Bar- to shew that the said Samuel Gwath- 
mey has forfeited his right to a seat in the Council in conse- 
quence of his having- accepted another commission under the 
President of the United States, an enquiry which according 
to all the laws usages and customs which prevail throughout 
the United States, properly and exclusively belongs to this 
Council. 

Special Message : Resignation of Samuel Gwathmey 

October 14, 1808 
Vincennes Western Sun, December 10, 1808 

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: 

I have it now in my power to give you decisive information 
on the subject of Mr. Samuel Gwathmey's resignation of his 
seat in the Legislative Council. 

Previous to the meeting of the Legislature I received from 
Mr. Gwathmey a letter requesting me to communicate to the 
President of the United States his resignation of his appoint- 
ment as councillor, but when the session was opened, finding 
that but three members of the Council attended and hearing 
that there was a probability that one of them would vacate 
his seat, either by resignation or by his election to the office 
of delegate to Congress, I returned Mr. Gwathmey his letter 
of resignation and strongly urged the propriety of his taking 
his seat for a week or two, to prevent a dissolution of the 
Legislatui'e for the want of a competent number of members 
in the Council. He has, however, declined doing so, and 
■wishes me to notify you that he considers himself no longer 
a member of the Council.

Special Message Militia 

October 20, 1808 
Vincennes Western Sun, December 2i, 1808 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and House of Repre- 
sentatives 
At the opening of the present session I recommended to 
the two houses to take the militia law into their serious con- 
sideration for the purpose of amending such parts of it as 
were susceptible of improvement. I now reiterate my re- 
quest on that subject. From the critical examination which 
I have lately given the law, it appears to be more defective 
than I first supposed. It appears that the commander-in- 
chief is only authorized by that law to call the militia into 
actual service when there is an actual or threatened inva- 
sion. There are a thousand exigencies which may require a 
part of the militia to be called out other than that of an in- 
vasion, and in every State of the LTnion the executive is in- 
vested with this power. It may indeed be supposed that the 
right is inherent in the commission of commander-in-chief. 
However this may be, it is evident that without the aid of 
the laws he cannot enforce his orders nor compel the obedi- 
ence of the privates. But the most serious difficulty arises 
fi'om the want of a provision by law for the pay and sub- 
sistence of those who are called into service. Men may serve 
for a short time without pay, but it is impossible that they 
can do duty without provisions. I must therefore recom- 
mend to the two houses to take the subject into their con- 
sideration, and adopt such measures in the premises as may 
appear to them proper and just. And I also recommend to 
them the claim of the companies of militia of this county

Special Message Vetoing a Bill Establishing Judicial 
System 

October 24, 1808 

Vincennes Weste7-n Sun, Febi-uary i, 1809 
Gentlemen of the Legislative Council: 

I have received and duly considered the bill which originated 
in the Council, entitled "An act establishing district courts 
and a high court of errors and appeals." I sincerely lament 
the necessity which compels me to withhold my consent to it 
under its present form, because the general principles and pro- 
visions of the bill are such as I most cordially approve and 
have on several occasions recommended to the two houses. 
My objections are entirely confined to the third and ninth 
sections. 

By the former the clerks of the several courts of common 
pleas are ex officio clerks of the district courts in their re- 
spective counties, where the emoluments of each are not suffi- 
cient to induce a properly qualified person to undertake the 
discharge of them. But in several of the counties it is prob- 
able that either of them [Clerkships] would be an object to a 
man of business; at least the executive should be possessed 
of power to divide them if he thinks proper to do so. This 
section also declares that the executive shall remove the clerk 
of any court upon the application of the court to which he is 
clerk. I cannot consent that a single judge, or any number 
of judges, shall have the right to direct the executive in any 
matter which is purely of an executive nature. 

My objections to the ninth section of the bill is that it is in 
contradiction to a law of Congress which declares that any 
one judge of the Territory shall have authority to hold any 
court in the said Territory, the others being absent; but this 
section disqualifies a judge from holding two courts succes- 
sively in the same county.^

October 25, 1808 
Vincennes Western Sun, Janiuiry H, 1809 

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives 

I cannot give my consent to the bill which originated in 
your house, entitled "An act concerning the Attorney General, 
and for other purposes," because it violates the ordinance 
[of 1787] which declares that the appointment of all officers 
is vested in the Governor of the Territory. Were it indeed 
otherwise, I should consider it highly improper that the officer 
who prosecutes the pleas of the United States should derive 
his appointment from any other source than the United States, 
or their servant and agent, the Governor for the time being.'

Special Message: Resignation of Gwathmey 

October 25, 1808 
Vincennes Western Sun, February 11, 1809 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council 

I have inadvertently neglected to communicate to the Coun- 
cil that Saml. Gwathmey resigned his seat in their body, that 
I have communicated the same to the House of Representa- 
tives and shall by the next mail communicate it to the Presi- 
dent. As Mr. Gwathmey's resignation was made known to 
me before I had an opportunity of transmitting to the Presi- 
dent the resolutions which I some time since received from 
the Council for that purpose, I did not think it was necessary 
to transmit therh at all. 

William Henry Harrison 

1. There was some party spirit shown in this affair. The anti-slavery party con- 
trolled the Assembly and also favored a division of the Territoi-y- The governor was 
opposed to the latter movement especially. When Benjamin Parke became territorial 
judge Thomas Randolph, a Virjrinian of the famous Randolph family and a warm 
personal friend of Harrison, was appointed, June 2, 1808. attorney general and it 
was his office the Assembly attempted to get control of. Randolph, the brilliant young 
descendant of Pocahontas was killed by the Indians at Tippecanoe. 



 

Special Message Tax on Horses 

October 26, 1808 

Vincennes Wests')!! Sun, Januwry H, 1809 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council and House of Repre- 
sentatives 
I have received the bill which you have passed, entitled 
"An act to alter and repeal certain parts of an act entitled 
an act to regulate county levies," and I have approved and 
signed it with pleasure. The abolishing the tax on neat cattle 
and on young men^ will afford some relief to the poor and to 
the farming interest. But I must again most strongly rec- 
ommend to the two houses to take off or at least lessen the 
tax upon work horses. If the other objects of county levy 
are not sufficient to meet the county expenses, some of those 
expenses, the compensation to the judges of the common pleas 
for instance, might with propriety be transfered to the Ter- 
ritorial treasury. The average price of all the horses which 
are to be found in any county will not, I am confident, ex- 
ceed forty dollars, and for that forty dollars of capital fifty 
cents per annum is exacted, whilst a capital of one hundred 
dollars in land pays only twenty cents to the Territory and 
five cents to the counties. The tax on horses in the State of 
Kentucky is fixed, as I am told, at nine cents. Let us imitate 
this wise example of our neighbors, and relieve the poorer 
class of our fellow citizens from the intolerable burden that 
oppresses them.

Washington, December 22, 1808 

Dawson, Harrison, 111 

Sir, 

By the treaty of 1803, we obtained, from the Kaskaskias, 
the country as far as the ridge dividing the waters of the 
Kaskaskia from those of the Illinois river. By the treaty 
of 1804, with the Sacks and Foxes, they ceded to us from the 
Illinois to the Ouisconsin. Between these two cessions is a 
gore of country, to wit, between the Illinois river and Kas- 
kaskia line, which I understand to have belonged to the Pe- 
orias, and that that tribe is now extinct. If both these facts 
be true, we succeed to their title by our being proprietors 
paramount of the whole country. 

In this case, it is interesting to settle our boundary with 
our next neighbors, the Kickapoos. Where their western 
boundary is I know not; but they cannot come lower down 

1. Black Hoof was a well known chief of a Shawnee village. His name Cut- 
thewekasaw is signed to the Greenville treaty of 1795: to the treaty of 1803; 1805; and 
to the second treaty of Greenville. 1814. He was born in Florida, and remembered his 
tribe moving from there to Pennsylvania and Ohio. He was prominent in the fight 
against Braddock in 1755. and was in all the Indian wars with the Americans in the 
Northwest to the close of the last century, until the treaty of Greenville in 1795. Up 
to that time he had been the bitter enemy of the white man ; afterward he remained 
faithful to that treaty. Tecumtha tried to seduce him. but failed, and by his influence 
he kept a greater portion of his tribe from joining the British in the War of 1812. 
He became the ally of the United States, but bodily infii-mity kept him from active 
service. In the instance of his friendship just mentioned, he simply brought his 
people to camp, and left, younger chiefs to conduct them in the campaign. 

Lossing, War of 1812, 64i 



 

the Illinois river than the Illinois lake, on which stood the 
old Peoria fort, and perhaps not so low. The Kickapoos are 
bounded to the S. E. I presume, by the ridge between the 
waters of the Illinois and Wabash, to which the Miamis 
claim ; and N. E. by the Potawatamies. Of course it is with 
the Kickapoos alone we have to settle a boundary. I would 
therefore recommend to you to take measures for doing this. 
You will, of course, first endeavor, with all possible caution, 
to furnish yourself with the best evidence to be had of the 
real location of the S. W. boundary of the Kickapoos, and 
then endeavor to bring them to an acknowledgment of it, 
formally, by a treaty of limits, if it be nothing more; the 
ordinary presents are all that will be necessary; but if they 
cede a part of their own country, then a price proportioned 
will be proper. In a letter to you of Feb. 27, 1803, I men- 
tioned that I had heard there was still one Peoria man living, 
and that a compensation, making him easy for life, should be 
given him, and his conveyance of the country by a regular 
deed be obtained. If there be such a man living, I think this 
should still be done. The ascertaining the line between the 
Kickapoos and us is now of importance, because it will close 
our possessions on the hither bank of the Mississippi, from 
the Ohio to the Ouisconsin, and give us a broad margin to 
prevent the British from approaching that river, on which, 
under color of their treaty, they would be glad to hover, that 
they might smuggle themselves and their merchandize into 
Louisiana. — Their treaty can only operate on the country so 
long as it is Indian ; and in proportion as it becomes ours ex- 
clusively, their ground is narrowed. It makes it easier, too, 
for us to adopt, on this side of the Mississippi, a policy we 
are beginning on the other side — that of permitting no trad- 
ers, either ours or theirs, to go to the Indian towns, but 
oblige them all to settle and be stationary at our factories, 
where we can have their conduct under our observation and 
control. However, our first object must be to blockade them 
from the Mississippi ; and to this I ask the favor of your at- 
tention, and salute you with great friendship and respect.

House Report Dividing Indiana Territory 

December 31, 1808 

Am. Sta. Pa. Misc. I, 945 

Mr. Jesse B. Thomas,' from the committee to whom was re- 
ferred the resolution to inquire into the expediency of 
dividing the Indiana Territory, made the following report : 

That, by the fifth article of the ordinance of Congress 
[1787] for the government of the Territory of the United 
States northwest of the river Ohio, it is stipulated that there 
shall be formed in the said Territory, not less than three, 
nor more than five States; and the boundaries of the States, 
as soon as Virginia shall alter her act of session and consent 
to the same, shall become fixed and established as follows, 
to wit: 

I. Jesse Burgess Thomas, a descendant of Lord Baltimore, was born in Hagerstown, 
Md., in 1777 ; moved west in 1779 ; studied law with his brother, Richard Symmes 
Thomas, in Bracken county, Ky., where he was married — his wife dying within a year 
after marriage. On the organization of Dearborn Co., Indiana territory, March 7, 1803, 
he located at Lawrenceburgh as a practising attorney, and was elected, Jan. 3, 1805, 
to represent that county in the legislature which convened at Vincennes, Feb. 1, by 
proclamation of Gov. Wm. H. Harrison, to choose members of the legislative council : 
from the ten names thus selected congress appointed five : again, on proclamation of 
the governor, the legislature assembled at Vincennes, July 29, 1805. and at this, its 
first session, he was elected speaker, and Benj. Cha 
of the council : he presided as speaker of the firs 
Assembly at Vincennes, from Sept. 26. 1805 to Oct. 
when he was elected by the Assembly as delegate t< 
Parke, resigned, serving from Dec. 1, 1808, to March 3, 
missioned Aug. 24, 1805, by Gov. Harrison, a captain of militia of Dearborn county: 
during his legislative term, he married the widow of Maj. John Francis Hamtramck, 
and moved to Vincennes, residing there a short time : on the organization of the Illinois 
territory, March 7, 1809, President Madison appointed him one of its judges ; he then 
moved to Kaskaskia, thence to Cahokia, and later to Edwardsville ; in July, 1818, he 
was a delegate from St. Clair Co. to, and president of the convention that formed the 
constitution of Illinois and suggested its name : was elected by the first General Assembly

The Western State shall be bounded by the Mississippi, the 
Ohio, and Wabash rivers; a direct line drawn from the 
Wabash and Post Vincennes, due north to the Territorial line 
between the United States and Canada, and by the said Ter- 
ritorial line to the lake of the woods and Mississippi. 

The middle State shall be bounded by the said direct line, 
the Wabash, from Post Vincennes, to the Ohio by the Ohio by 
a direct line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great 
Miami, to the said Territorial line, and by the said Territorial 
line. 

The Eastern State shall be bounded by the last mentioned 
direct line, the Ohio, Pennsylvania, and the said Territorial 
line: 

Provided, however, and it is further understood and de- 
clared, that the boundaries of these three States shall be sub- 
ject so far to be altered, that if Congress shall hereafter 
find it expedient, they shall have authority to form one or 
two States in that part of the said Territory which lies north 
of an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend 
or extreme of Lake Michigan. And whenever any of the 
said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, 
such State shall be admitted by its delegates into the Con- 
gress of the United States on an equal footing with the orig- 
inal States, in all respects whatever; and shall be at Liberty 
to form a permanent constitution and State Government : 

Provided, the constitution and Government so to be formed 
shall be republican, and in conformity to the principles con- 
tained in these articles ; and so far as it can be consistent with 
the general interest of the confederacy, such admission shall 
be allowed at an earlier period, and when there may be a less 
number of free inhabitants in the State than sixty thousand. 

By the aforesaid article, it appears to your committee that 
the line fixed as the boundary of the States to be formed in 
the Indiana Territory, is unalterable, unless by common con- 
sent ; that the line of demarcation which the Wabash affords 
between the eastern and western portions of said Territory, 
added to the wide extent of wilderness country which sep- 
arates the population in each, constitute reasons in favor of 
a division, founded on the soundest policy, and conformable 
with the natural situation of the country. The vast distance 
from the settlements west of the Wabash to the present seat 



 

of Territorial Government, renders the administration of 
justice burdensome and expensive to them in the highest 
degree. The superior courts of the Territory are, by law, 
established at Vincennes, at which place suitors, residing in 
every part of the Territory, are compelled to attend with their 
witnesses, which to those who reside west of the Wabash 
amounts almost to a total denial of justice. The great dif- 
ficulty of travelling through an extensive and loathsome wil- 
derness, the want of food, and other necessary accommoda- 
tions on the road, often presents an insurmountable barrier 
to the attendance of witnesses; and even when their at- 
tendance is obtained, the accumulated expense of prosecuting 
suits where the evidence is at so remote a distance, is a cause 
of much embarrassment to a due and impartial distribution 
of justice, and a proper execution of the laws for the redress 
of private wrongs. 

In addition to the above considerations, your committee con- 
ceive that the scattered situation of the settlements over this 
extensive Territory cannot fail to enervate the powers of the 
Executive, and render it almost impossible to keep that part 
of the Government in order. 

It further appears to your committee, that a division of 
the said Territory will become a matter of right under the 
aforesaid article of the ordinance, whenever the General Gov- 
ernment shall establish therein a State Government; and the 
numerous inconveniences which would be removed by an im- 
mediate separation, would have a direct tendency to encour- 
age and accelerate migration to each district, and thereby 
give additional strength and security to those outposts of the 
United States, exposed to the inroads of a savage neighbor, 
on whose friendly dispositions no permanent reliance can be 
placed. 

Your committee have no certain data, on which to ascer- 
tain the number of inhabitants in each section of the Ter- 
ritory ; but, from the most accurate information they are en- 
abled to collect, it appears that west of the Wabash, there 
are about the number of eleven thousand, and east of said 
river, about the number of seventeen thousand, and that the 
population of each section is in a state of rapid increase. 

Your committee, after maturely considering this subject, 
are of opinion that there exists but one objection to the 



 

establishment of a separate Territorial Goveniment west of 
the river Wabash, and that objection is based on the addi- 
tional expense which would, in consequence thereof, be in- 
curred by the Government of the United States. But it is 
also worthy of observation, that the increased value of the 
public lands in each district, arising from the public insti- 
tutions which would be permanently fixed in each, to com- 
port with the convenience of the inhabitants, and the augmen- 
tation of emigrants all of whom must become immediate pur- 
chasers of these lands, would far exceed the amount of ex- 
penditure produced by the contemplated temporary Govern- 
ment. 

And your committee, being convinced that it is the wish 
of a large majority of the citizens of the said Territory that 
a separation thereof should take place, deem it always just 
and wise policy to grant to every portion of the people of 
the Union that foi-m of Government which is the object of 
their wishes, when not incompatible with the constitution of 
the United States, nor subversive of their allegiance to the 
national sovereignty. 

Your committee, therefore, respectfully submit the follow- 
ing resolution : 

Resolved: That it is expedient to divide the Indiana Ter- 
ritory, and to establish a separate Territorial Government 
west of the river Wabash, agreeably to the ordinance for the 
Government of the Territory of the United States northwest 
of the river Ohio, passed on the 13th day of July, 1787.=

Sir, 

The general government of the United States has con- 
sidered it their duty and interest to extend their care and 
patronage over the Indian tribes within their limits, and to 

2. This committee was composed of Jesse B. Thomas. John Smilie of Penn.. 
Burwell Bassett of Va., Samuel Tagsart of Mass.. and Thomas Kenan of N. C. Mr. 
Thomas appeared in Concress Nov. 18, 1808 as delegate to finish the term of Benjamin 
Park, resigned. This petition with several others was read that day and had doubtless 
been brought by Thomas, who was under promise to work for a separation. On his 
return he moved to Kaskaskia. Along with the report a bill was presented which 
became a law Feb. 3, 1809. The report is given in the Annals, for Dec. 31, 1808. 



 

endeavor to render them friends, and, in time, perhaps, use- 
ful members of the nation. Perceiving the injurious effects 
produced by their inordinate use of spirituous Hquors, they 
passed laws authorizing measures against the vending or dis- 
tributing such liquors among them. Their introduction by 
traders was accordingly prohibited, and for some time was 
attended with the best effects. I am informed, however, that 
latterly the Indians have got into the practice of purchasing 
such liquors themselves, in the neighboring settlements of 
whites, and of carrying them into their towns, and that, in 
this way, our regulations, so salutary to them, are now de- 
feated. I must, therefore, request your excellency to submit 
this matter to the consideration of your legislature. I per- 
suade myself that, in addition to the moral inducements 
which will readily occur, they will find it not indifferent to 
their own interest to give us their aid in removing, for their 
neighbors, this great obstacle to their acquiring industrious 
habits, and attaching themselves to the regular and useful 
pursuits of life. For this purpose it is much desired that they 
should pass effectual laws to restrain their citizens from 
vending and distributing spirituous liquors to the Indians. I 
pray your excellency to accept the assurances of my great 
esteem and respect.

Jefferson to Miamies' 

December, 1808 

Dawson, Hai-rison, 117 

To My Children, the Miamis, Potawatamies, Delawares, and 
Chippewas : 
Some of you are old enough to remember, and the younger 
have heard from their fathers, that this country was for- 
merly governed by the English. While they governed it, there 
were constant wars between the white and the red people. 
To such a height was the hatred of both parties carried, that 

1. Toward the close of October 1808 the governors of the several states and terri- 
tories were ordered to organize and equip the militia to the number of 100.000. At the 
same time a movement was begun to pacify the Indians. Leading chiefs were sum- 
moned to Washington that the aged Jefferson might address them before he retired 
from the presidency. These addresses were made to the northwestern Indians. 

Dawson, Harrison, lis 



 

they thought it no crime to kill one another in cold blood 
whenever they had an opportunity. This spirit led many of 
the Indians to take side against us in the war; and at the 
close of it, the English made peace for themselves, and left 
the Indians to get out of it as well as they could. It was 
not till twelve years after that we are able, by the treaty of 
Greenville, to close our wars with all our red neighbors. 
From that moment, my children, the policy of this country 
towards you, has been entirely changed. General Washing- 
ton, our first President, began a line of just and friendly 
conduct towards you. Mr. Adams, the second, continued it; 
and from the moment I came into the administration, I have 
looked upon you with the same good will as my own fellow 
citizens, have considered your interests as our interests, and 
peace and friendship as a blessing to us all. Seeing, with 
sincere regret, that your people were wasting away, believing 
that this proceeded from your frequent wars, and the de- 
structive use of spirituous liquors, and the scanty supplies 
of food, I have inculcated peace with all your neighbors, have 
endeavored to prevent the introduction of spiritous liquors 
among you, and have pressed on you to rely for food on the 
culture of the earth more than on hunting. On the contrary, 
my children, the English persuade you to hunt. They supply 
you with spirituous liquors, and are now endeavoring to en- 
gage you to join them in the war against us, should a war 
take place. You possess reason, my children, as we do, and 
you will judge for yourselves which of us advise you as 
friends. The course they advise, has worn you down to your 
present numbers ; but temperance, peace, and agriculture, will 
raise you up to what your forefathers were, will pi-epare you 
to possess property, to wish to live under regular laws, to 
join us in our government, to mix with us in society, and 
your blood and ours united, will spread again over the great 
island. 

My children, this is the last time I shall speak to you as 
your father; it is the last counsel I have to give. I am now 
too old to watch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen 
states and their territories. I have, therefore, requested my 
fellow citizens to permit me to retire to live with my family, 
to choose another chief and another father for you, and in 
a short time I shall retire, and resign into his hands the care 



 

of your and our concerns. Be assured, my children, he will 
have the same friendly disposition towards you which I have 
had, and that you will find in him a true and affectionate 
father. Entertain, therefore, no uneasiness on account of this 
change, for there will be no change as to you. Indeed, my 
children, this is now the disposition towards you of all our 
people. They look upon you as brethren, born in the same 
land, and having the same interests. In your journey to this 
place, you have seen many of them. I am cei'tain they have 
received you as brothers, and been ready to show you every 
kindness. You will see the same on the road by which you 
will return; and were you to pass from north to south, or 
east to west, in any part of the United States, you would find 
yourselves always among friends. Tell this, therefore, to 
your people on your return home. Assure them that no 
change will ever take place in our dispositions towards them. 
Deliver to them my adieus, and my prayers to the Great Spirit 
for their happiness. Tell them, that during my administra- 
tion, I have held their hand fast in mine, that I will put it 
into the hand of their new father, who will hold it as I have 

done. „ 

Thomas Jefferson 

Jefferson to Dela wares 

December, 1808 
Dawson, Harrison, 113-115 

My Son, the Beaver,' the Head Warrior of the Delawares, 

I am glad to see you here, and to take you by the hand. 
I am the friend of your nation, and sincerely wish them well. 
I shall now speak to them as their friend, and advise them 
for their good. I have read your speech to the secretary at 
war, and considered it maturely. You therein say that, after 
the conclusion of the treaty at Greenville, the Wapanahies, 
and other tribes of Indians, mutually agreed to maintain 
peace among themselves and with the United States. This, 
my son, was wise, and I entirely approve of it. And I equally 
commend you for what you further say, that yours and the 
other tribes have constantly maintained the articles of peace 

1. Signed Tomafcuee to the treaty of 1804 and Punchlmck to that of 1S17, if it is 



 

with us, and have ceased to listen to bad advice. I hope, my 
son, you will continue in this good line of conduct, and I 
assure you that the United States will forever religiously 
observe the treaty on their part; not only because they have 
agreed to it, but because they esteem you. They wish you 
well, and would endeavor to promote your welfare, even if 
there were no treaty ; and, rejoicing that you have ceased to 
listen to bad advice, they hope you will listen to that which 
is good. 

My Son, you say that the Osage nation has refused to be 
at peace with your nation or any others. That they have 
refused the offers of peace and extended their aggressions to 
all people. This is all new to me. I never heard of an Osage 
coming to war on this side of the Mississippi. Have they 
attacked your towTis, killed your people, or destroyed your 
game? Tell me in what year they did this, or what is the 
agression they have committed on yours and the other tribes 
on this side the Mississippi. But if they have defended them- 
selves and their country, when your tribes have gone over to 
destroy them, they have only done what brave men ought to 
do, and what just men ought never to have forced them to 
do. Your having committed one wrong on them gives you 
no right to commit a second; and be assured, my son, that 
the Almighty Spirit which is above, will not look down with 
indifference on your going to war against his children on the 
other side of the Mississippi, who have never come to attack 
you. He is their father as well as your father, and he did 
not make the Osages to be destroyed by you. I tell you that 
if you make war unjustly on the Osages. he will punish your 
nation for it. He will send upon your nation famine, sick- 
ness, or the tomahawk of a stronger nation, who will cut 
you off from the land. Consider this thing, then, well, be- 
fore you strike ; his hand is uplifted over your heads and his 
stroke will follow yours. 

My son, I tell you these things because I wish your nation 
well. I wish them to become a peaceable, happy, and pros- 
perous nation. And if this war against the Osages concerned 
yourselves alone, I would confine myself to giving you advice, 
and leave it to yourselves to profit by it. — But this war deeply 
concerns the United States. Between you and the Osages is 
a country of many hundred miles extent belonging to the 



 

United States. Between you, also, is the Mississippi, the 
river of peace. On this river are floating the boats, the peo- 
ple, and all the produce of the western states of the union. 
This commerce must not be exposed to the alarm of war 
parties crossing the river, nor must a path of blood be made 
across our country. What we say to you, my son, we say 
also to the Osages. We tell them that armed bands of war- 
riors, entering on the lands or waters of the United States, 
without our consent, are the enemies of the United States. 
If, therefore, considerations of your own welfare are not suf- 
ficient to restrain you from this unauthorized war, let me 
warn you on the part of the United States to respect their 
rights, not to violate their territory. 

You request, my son, to be informed of our warfares, that 
you may be enabled to inform your nation on your return. 
We are yet at peace, and shall continue so, if the injustice 
of other nations will permit us. The war beyond the water 
is universal ; we wish to keep it out of our island ; but should 
we go to war, we wish our red children to take no part in it. 
We are able to fight our own battles; and we know that our 
red children cannot aff'ord to spill their blood in our quarrels. 
Therefore, we do not ask it, but wish them to remain at 
home in quiet, taking care of themselves and their families. 
You complain that the white people in your neighborhood, 
have stolen a number of your horses. My son, the secretary 
at war will take measures for enquiring into the truth of 
this; and if it so appears, justice shall be done you. 

The two swords you ask shall be given to you ; and we shall 
be happy to give you every other proof that we esteem you 
personally, my son ; and shall always be ready to do anything 
which may advance your comfort and happiness. I hope you 
will deliver to your nation the words I have spoken to you, 
and assure them that, in everything which can promote their 
welfare and prosperity, they shall ever find me their true and 
faithful friend and father — that I hold them fast by the hand 
of friendship, which I hope they will not force me to let go. 

Thomas Jefferson 



 

Jefferson to Dela wares 

December 1808 

Dawson, Harrison, 115-117 

My Son, Captain Hendrick, and my Children, the Delawares, 
Mohiccons, and Munsies 

I am glad to see you here, to receive your salutations, and 
to return them, by taking you by the hand, and renewing to 
you the assurances of my friendship. I learn, with pleasure, 
that the Miamis and Potawatamies have given you some of 
their lands on the White River to live on, and that you pro- 
pose to gather there your scattered tribes and to dwell on it 
all your days. 

The picture which you have drawn, my son, of the increase 
of our numbers, and the decrease of yours, is just; the causes 
are very plain, and the remedy depends on yourselves alone. 
You have lived by hunting the deer and buffalo ; as these have 
been driven westward, you have sold out on the sea board, 
and moved westwardly in pursuit of them. As they became 
scarce there, your food has failed you; you have been a part 
of every year without food, except the roots and other un- 
wholesome things you could find in the forests. Scanty and 
unwholesome food produce diseases and death among your 
children, and hence you have raised fur, and your numbers 
have decreased. Frequent wars, too, and the abuse of spirit- 
uous liquors have assisted in lessening your numbers. The 
whites, on the other hand, are in the habit of cultivating the 
earth, of raising stocks of cattle, hogs, and other domestic ani- 
mals in much greater numbers than they could kill of deer and 
buffalo; having always a plenty of food and clothing, they 
raise abundance of children ; they double their numbers every 
twenty years. The new swarm are continually advancing 
upon the country like flocks of pigeons, and so they will con- 
tinue to do. Now, my children, if we wanted to diminish our 
numbers, we could give up the culture of the earth, pursue the 
deer and buffalo, and be always at war. This would soon 
reduce us to be as few as your are ; and if you wish to increase 
your numbers, you must give up the deer and buffalo, live in 
peace, and cultivate the earth. You see, then, my children, 
that it depends on yourselves alone, to become a numerous 
and great people. Let me entreat you, therefore, on the lands 



 

now given you, to begin to give every man a farm; let him 
enclose it, cultivate it, build a warm house on it, and when he 
dies let it belong to his wife and children after him. Nothing 
is so easy as to learn to cultivate the earth; all your women 
understand it; and to make it easier, we are always ready to 
teach you how to make ploughs, hoes, and other necessary 
utensils. If the men will take the labor of the earth from 
the women, they will learn to spin and weave, and to clothe 
their families. In this way you will also raise many children. 
You will double your numbers every twenty years, and soon 
fill the land your friends have given you; and your children 
will never be tempted to sell the spot on which they have been 
born, raised, have labored, and called their own. When once 
you have property, you will want laws and magistrates to pro- 
tect your property and persons, and to punish those among 
you who commit crimes. You will find that our laws are good 
for this purpose. You will wish to live under them ; you will 
unite yourselves with us, join in our great councils, and form 
one people with us, and we shall all be Americans. You will 
mix with us by marriage. Your blood will run in our veins, 
and will spread with us over this great island. 

Instead then, my children, of the gloomy prospect you have 
drawn of your total disappearance from the face of the earth, 
which is true if you continue to hunt the deer and buffalo and 
go to war, you see what a brilliant aspect is offered to your 
future history. If you give up war and hunting, adopt the 
culture of the earth, and raise domestic animals. You see how, 
from a small family you may become a great nation, by adopt- 
ing the course, which from the small beginning you have de- 
scribed, has made us a great nation. 

My Children, I will give you a paper declaring your right to 
hold against all persons the lands given you by the Miamis and 
Potawatamies, and that you never can sell them without their 
consent. But I must tell you that if ever they and you agree 
to sell, no paper which I can give you can prevent your doing 
what you please with your own land. The only way to pre- 
vent this, is to give to every one of your people a farm, which 
shall belong to him and his family, and which the nation shall 
have no right to take from them and sell. In this way alone, 
can you ensure the lands to your descendants, through all gen- 
erations, and that it shall never be sold from under their feet. 



 

It is not the keeping your lands which will keep your people 
alive on them, after the deer and buffalo shall have left them. 
It is the cultivating them alone which can do that. The hun- 
dredth part in corn and cattle, will support you better than the 
whole in deer and buffalo. 

My son Hendrick, deliver these words to your people. I 
have spoken to them plainly, that they may see what is before 
them, and that it is in their own power to go on dwindling to 
nothing, or to become again a great people. It is for this rea- 
son I wish them to live in peace with all people ; to teach their 
young men to love agriculture, rather than war and hunting. 
Let these words sink deep in their hearts, and let them often 
repeat them and consider them. Tell them that I hold them 
fast by the hand, and that I will ever be their friend, to ad- 
vise and assist them in following the true path to their future 
happiness.

Proclamation : Apportionment of Representatives 

April 4, 1809 
Vincennes Western Sun, April 15, 1809 

Whereas, from the late division of the territory [into Indi- 
ana and Illinois] it has become necessary to make a new ap- 
portionment of the representatives to the General Assembly, 
I have thought proper to issue this my proclamation, hereby 
directing and declaring that the house of representatives shall, 
at the next General Assembly, be composed of eight members, 
of which the county of Knox shall furnish three ; the" county 
of Clark, two; the county of Dearborn, two; and the county 
of Harrison, one. And I do further direct that the election 
for the additional representative from the counties of Knox, 
Clark, and Dearborn, and for the member hereby assigned to 
the county of Harrison, shall be held on Monday the twenty- 
second day of May next ensuing, at the places in the several 
tov/nships of the said counties respectively which have or may 
be assigned by the courts of common pleas of said counties for 
that purpose. 

Done at Vincennes, in the said Territory, on the fourth of 
April, one thousand eight hundred and nine. In testimony 



 

whereof I have hereunto set my hand, and have caused the 
seal of the Territory to be affixed.^

The Indian prophets have been industriously employed, the

and other bands of Indians residing on the Mississippi and 
Illinois rivers, to war against the frontiers of this country.

Sir: 

I had the honor some weeks ago [Dec. 31] to receive a letter 
from the late President of the United States directing me to 
commence a negotiation with the Kickapoo Indians and with 
the remnant of the Peorias for the settlement of our boundary 
and eventually for a further extinguishment of the title south 
of the Illinois river. But before I could take any effectual 
steps to carry this order into effect the law for erecting that 
part of the Territory into a separate government came to my 
hands. Altho the authority with which this business would 
have been transacted (being that of a commission constituting 
me Commissioner Plenipotentiary for Treating with the In- 
dians northwest of the Ohio) is quite distinct and independent 
of my appointment as governor of the Indiana Territory, I 
have thought it best to postpone the execution of the Presi- 

1. The act organizing Indiana territory, approved May 7. 1800, provided that the 
house of representatives of the territory should consist of not less than seven members 
until the total number of electors of the territoi-y should equal 5000. The governor does 
not seem to have been advised of the recent law of congress, approved February 27, 
1809, which made the minimum nimiber of representatives nine and took the power 
of apportionment out of his hands and vested it in the assembly.

As the Indians in this agency appears to be agitated respect- 
ing the conduct and as they say the intentions of the Shawnees 
Prophet I deem it my duty to communicate some of the most 
material information that has come to my knowledge on this 
subject to you. The Chippeways, Ottaways, and Pottawat- 
omys are hurrying away from him and say that their reason 
for doing so is because he has told them to receive the Toma- 
hawk from him and destroy all the white people at Vincennes 
and all those that live on the Wabash and Ohio as low down 
as the mouth of Ohio and as high up as Cincinnati ; that the 
great spirit had directed that they should do so at the same 
time threatening them with destruction if they refused to 
comply with what he proposed. 

I am convinced that something is intended among them 
from the manner in which the Indians are leaving the 
Prophet, but I do not believe that any harm is intended, or 
will be attempted by the Prophet or any other Indians against 
the White people. It appears to me that the Lake Indians in- 
tend falling on the Prophet in consequence of so many of them 
dying at his place of residence last fall. All the Traders be- 
lieve that the Prophet intends to strike a blow at the white 
people, among them that are of this opinion are [Peter] La- 
Fontaine^ and [Touissant] Dubois. The Little Turtle, 5

Medals, and other influential Indian Chiefs agree with me that 
no harm is intended towards the whites. Mr. Dubois who 
passed the Prophet's Village a few days ago, told me that fifty 
of the Winebagoes had just joined him, and that he under- 
stood that more were on their way, and appeared to be 
alarmed for the safety of the people in that quarter. The 
force the Prophet has at this time is not more than eighty or 
an hundred men and I don't believe he will ever be able to 
double his number; with this handful of men I am sure he 
will attempt nothing. At the same time I must say that it 
is and always has been my opinion that he only wanted power 
to make him dangerous. They cannot continue embodied long 
as they have no provision and no means to get any. Should 
you be of the opinion that it would be proper for me to do 
anything respecting this business more than keeping a watch- 
ful eye over the Prophet I shall be glad to receive your direc- 
tion. The Indians that are leaving him and daily passing this 
place are in a starved situation and humanity compells me to 
give them some provision which I hope will meet with your 
approbation, I shall give them as little as possible. 

Inclosed you will receive the amount of provision issued to 
the Indians in this agency by Capt. [Nathan] Heald- during 
my absence. The amount is more than is usually issued in 
the Winter, but I am convinced that the starved situation of 
the Indians in this agency fully justifies the quantity that has 
been issued. As I have received no particular instructions 
from the war office respecting the issue of provisions to In- 
dians and as the Indians are starving in this quarter I hope 
you will send me instructions by the Bearer in what manner 
to act in this respect. The Mianiies complain and say that 
one of their men has been killed in the neighborhood of that 
place lately, as it is a circumstance that I am not acquainted 
with I hope you will give me a statement how it happened in 
order that I may remove all wrong impressions that have been 
made on their minds on that subject. I hope you will en- 
deavour to purchase the land up the Wabash as high up as the

Sir: 

Since my last of the 12th inst. I have received by a special 
express a letter from Mr. [William] Wells [April 8, above] 
the Agent at Fort Wayne, a copy of Which I have now the 
honor to inclose. This letter is so strongly coroborative of 
the information received from Govr. [Meriwether] Lewis that 
I can no longer doubt of the hostile disposition of the Tribes 
of the Mississippi and Illinois River and those on the Wabash 
who adhere to the Shawnese Prophet. Messrs. [Peter] La- 
fontaine and [Touissant] Dubois the persons mentioned by 
Wells are two of the most respectable Indian Traders in this 
country, the former has more extensive intercourse with them 
than any other trader, speaks most of the Indian languages 
and has resided amongst them for thirty years. They are 
also men of honor and integrity and their opinions are more to 
be relied on in the present instance than that of Capt. Wells 
who has been absent from Fort Wayne during the whole 
Winter, and only reached it a few days before the date of his 
letter. Wells opinion and that of the chiefs whom he men- 
tions is entirely founded upon an erroneous estimate of the 
strength of the Prophets party. His disposition to do mis- 
chief he does not doubt. Wells had no information of the 
combination amongst the Tribes of the Mississippi and the 
Illinois and he is extremely incorrect as to the number of men 
now with the Prophet. He has probably not more than 80 or 
100 immediately at his place of residence, but I am well in- 
formed that he has within the distance of 40 or 50 miles of his 
village four or five times that number. I also fear that the 
story which has been circulated for some time of the de- 
termination of the Chippewas and Ottawas of Lake Michigan 
to fall upon the Prophet is a mere pretense suggested by the 
British to cover the real design of the former, and that when 
they reach the Wabash they will join the Prophet and the 
Winebagoes to fall upon our settlements. Under all these cir- 
cumstances and considering the unprotected situation of this 
town and the neighboring settlements I have determined to 
organize arm and equip and call into actual service two com- 
panies of volunteer militia agreeably to the instructions of the 



 

Secretary of War in his letter of the 17th of September 1807. 
Considerable progress has already been made in drawing out 
those men and in the course of two or three days I hope to 
have it completed. They will be placed upon the Wabash a 
few hundred yards below the Garrison called Fort Knox as 
well to protect it as to cover this place. Fort Knox is the 
depository of the arms and ammunition which have been sent 
here for the use of the militia. It consists of a range of open 
barracks and a block house not connected by pickets or any 
other defence. It is garrisoned by Lieut. [Ambrose] Whit- 
lock' with 14 or 1.5 men and the greater part of these are 
frequently absent with the Lieut, who is the paymaster of the 
District. Standing immediately upon the frontier both it and 
the Town of Vincennes could be surprised plundered and 
burned by an hundred Indians at any time without the least 
risk to themselves, as there is not a single family settled to the 
north and northwest to give notice of their approach. A de- 
tachment of 12 or 15 men of the two companies called out 
will be placed in the settlement of Bosseron 20 miles northeast 
of this place, from which as well as from the main body scouts 
will constantly be kept out for a distance around the settle- 
ments. I have directed Mr. Wells to call upon the Delawares, 
Miami and Potawatomi tribes to fulfil that article of the 
Treaty of Greenville by which they are bound to prevent any 
party with hostile intentions against our settlements to pass 
through their country. This is essentially necessary for their 
own safety. For as our people will generally pursue the at- 
tacking party and it will be impossible to distinguish the 
different tribes the innocent will frequently suffer for the 
guilty, at any rate, it will be often in the power of the hostile 
tribes so to manage their attack as to make it appear to be 
the act of our friends, and the war commenced by a few of 
the most feeble and insignificant tribes will gradually extend 
to all the rest. 

The violence and indiscretion of our own people will also 
greatly contribute to this result. 

I shall do myself the Honor to communicate to you any-

Sir: 

Since my last of the 18th Instant I have received informa- 
tion which has in a great measure dissipated all my anxiety 
on the score of a rupture with the Indians at least so far as 
relates to the Tribes on the Wabash and its Waters. It is 
principally derived from two subordinate Indian traders, who 
have spent the winter at the towns of the Potawatomies a few 
leagues below the station of the Prophet. Those men most 
positively assert that the Prophet is feared and hated by all the 
neighbouring tribes, the Kickapoos excepted and that it was 
only a dread of his supernatural powers which prevented them 
from falling on him but that this is in a great measure de- 
stroyed by an incident which occured a few days ago. The 
Prophet had always declared that the least violence which 
would be offered to him or his followers would be punished by 
the immediate interposition of the Great Spirit who would not 
fail instantly to destroy the perpetrators of so great a sin. 
Three young men of the Ottawa and Chippawa Tribes were 
determined however to make the experiment and by the direc- 
tion of their own chiefs entered the Prophet's camp murdered 
a squaw within ten steps of his tent and effected their escape 
to the camp of their friends about 40 miles distant. 

The traders are of opinion that they will not fail to attack 
the Prophet as soon as they can be prepared for it. 

This information together with a number of other circum- 
stances which go to show the fidelity of the Miamis, Dela- 
wares, Weas, and Potawatomies of the Wabash, would have 
induced me to countermand the order for turning out the two 
companies mentioned in my last if it had reached me a few 
days sooner, but as we had got through all the trouble of call- 
ing them from their homes and organizing them I thought it 



 

best not to disband them until I heard some thing decisive 
from Governor [Meriwether] Lewis. Besides altho I believe 
sincerely that there is not the least danger from the Tribes 
above mentioned, yet I know that when an attack is medi- 
tated they are capable of practising almost any artifice to 
take the object of it by surprise. 

As the two companies of militia are placed in a situation 
convenient to me I shall exert myself to improve the time 
that they may remain in service in teaching them such of the 
military evolutions as suits the service that they are likely to 
be employed in. Having spent seven years of my life in the 
army and very much attached to the profession this employ- 
ment will be by no means unpleasant to me.

I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a letter, which 
confirms my suspicions of the British interference with our 
Indian affairs in this country. (Extract from the enclosed 
letter) : "I am at present in the fire, receiving Indian news 
every day. A chief of the Puant [the Winnebagoes] nation 
appears to be employed by the British to get all the nations 
of Indians to Detroit, to see their fathers, the British, who 
tell them that they pity them in their situation with the 
Americans, because the Americans had taken their lands and 
their game ; that they must join and send them ofi" from their 
lands ; they told the savages that the Americans could not give 
them a blanket, nor any thing good for their families. 

They said they had but one father that had helped them 
in their misfortunes, and that they would assemble, defend 
their father, and keep their lands." It appears that four Eng- 
lish subjects have been at Riviere la Roche [Red] this winter, 
in disguise ; they have been there to get the nations together, 
and send them on the American frontiers. Other Indians are 
pushed on, by our enemies, to take the fort of Belle Vue 
[Iowa] .

Sir: 

The information which I have received since my letter of 
the 26 ult. was written is entirely contradictory to that which 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 345 

I then detailed — the Mr. [Touissant] Dubois who [WilHam] 
Wells speaks of in the letter of which I had the honor to 
inclose you a copy arrived here a few days ago from Detroit 
via Fort Wayne. He is decidedly of opinion the the Prophet 
will attack our settlements. His opinion is formed from a 
variety of circumstances but principally from a communi- 
cation made to Mr. [Peter] Lafontain by two chiefs his 
friends, the substance of which was that the Prophet and his 
followers had determined to commence hostilities as soon as 
they could be prepared and to "sweep all the white people 
from the Wabash and White River" after which they in- 
tended to attack the Miamies. Dubois thinks there is no real 
misunderstanding between the Prophet and the Ottawas and 
Chippewas and that the Squaw who was said to have been 
killed by the latter died in reality a natural death and was 
then tomahawked and skalped by some of the Prophet's party 
to carry on the deception and to prevent us from taking the 
alarm at the force he is collecting and which he pretends is 
to protect him against the Chippewas and Ottawas — (about 
eight days ago he had with him three hundred and fifty war- 
riors well armed with Rifles and tolerably supplied with ana- 
munition, they have also bows and arrows War Clubs and a 
Kind of Spear). I still think he will not dare to attack us 
but I am preparing the Militia as well as circumstances per- 
mit and the two companies which I have ordered out are 
rapidly improving in discipline being daily exercised either 
by the Major who commands them or myself in the evolutions 
practised by General Wayne's army. The Prophet cannot 
keep the number of men which he now has embodied any 
length of time as soon as they disperse I shall dismiss the 
two companies which I have had mustered agreeably to the 
instructions of Genl. Dearborn by a careful person selected 
for that purpose. 

I have the honor to inclose herewith an extract [not found]

Har. Pa. 250 

Sir: 

I have great pleasure in being enabled to inform you that 
there no longer exists the least probability of a rupture with 
any of the Indian tribes of this frontier. The party which 
the Prophet had assembled have dispersed with manifest in- 
dications of terror and alarm. Whether this is to be at- 
tributed to the military pi-eparations which were made here, 
To the want of provisions, disappointment upon the part of 
the Prophet as to the force he expected to raise, or to the 
combination of all these causes, or whether indeed he had 
ever any design of attacking us I cannot at present deter- 
mine. Whatever I shall be able to discover on this subject 
shall form the matter of another communication. I have 
engaged a confidential Frenchman who speaks the Indian lan- 
guages to reside at the Prophet's Town for a few weeks to 
watch his movements and discover his politics. 

I have for several years considered a further extinguish- 
ment of Indian title to the North East of this and extending 
from the Wabash to the purchase made at the Treaty of 
Grouseland as a most desirable object. And it appears to me 
that the time has arrived when the purchase may be at- 
tempted with a considerable prospect of success. Our settle- 
ments here are much cramped by the vicinity of the Indian 
lands, which in the direction above mentioned is not more 
than twenty-one miles. The country oh the Wabash below 
this is sunken and wet, that to the north and west almost 
entirely Prairie and not of such a quality to be settled for 
many years. These circumstances must necessarily render 
the settlements here feeble for a considerable time unless a 
further extinguishment of title is effected in the direction I 
have mentioned. 

The effecting of this purchase will come within the scope 
of the Instructions hitherto received, but I shall conclude no 
bargain until I am honored with the President's further 
direction. 

The two companies of militia were dismissed on the 12th 
Instant. They have been regularly mustered and the pay- 



 

rolls are now preparing, as soon as they are finished they 
shall be forwarded. 

I have the honor to be most respectfully

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the several 
letters of your Excellency, dated the 11th 18th & 26th of 
April and of the 3rd & 16th of May, the latter containing 
the agreeable information of the dispersion of the hostile 
Combination of the Savages in your vicinity. It was appre- 
hended from the first accounts that more serious consequences 
might ensue but a reliance on your opinion & judgment en- 
couraged a belief, in the favorable termination which has 
taken place. It is with great satisfaction that I now request 
that you will be pleased to accept an assurance of my own, 
as I perceived you already possess the entire confidence of 
the executive in your Communications, together with their 
approbation of the measures adopted by your Excellency 
which have undoubtedly had their influence in producing the 
result. 

The proposal to extinguish the Indian Title to certain 
Lands East of the Wabash will be attended to — Your Ex- 
cellency will be satisfied that a proposal of this kind, will 
excite no disagreeable apprehension and produce no undesir- 
able efi'ects before It shall be made. 

On reinforcing the old or establishing new posts on the 
western Frontiers, there has been some difference of opinion. 
A permanent reinforcement of St. Louis & Detroit appears 
desirable. May I avail the public of your military experience 
& genei-al knowledge of the country by asking your opinion 
generally on the subject

The influence of the Prophet has been great, and his advice 
to the Indians injurious to them and the United States. We 
have the fullest evidence, that his object has been to form 
a combination of them in hostility to the United States. The 
powerful influence of the British has been exerted in a way 
alluring to the savage character. (Extract)

Harrison to Secretary of War- 

VlNCENNES, July 5th 1809 

Har. Pa. 252-263 

Sir: 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favor 
of the 5th ultimo. The President's and your approbation of 
my conduct is highly gratifying to me, and permit me to as- 
sure you Sir, that no exertions on my part shall be wanting 
to merit a continuance of the confidence of the Administra- 
tion. 

The Shawnee Prophet and about forty followers arrived 
here a week ago. He denies most strenuously any participa- 
tion in the late combination to attack our settlements which 
he says was entirely confined to the Tribes on the Mississippi 
and Illinois river and he claims the merit of having pre- 
vailed upon them to relinquish their intentions. I must con- 
fess that my suspicions of his guilt have been rather strength- 
ened than diminished in every interview I have had with 
him since his arrival. He acknowledges that he received an 
invitation to go to war against us from the British last fall, 
that he was apprised of the intentions of the Lake Indians 
early in the spring and warmly solicited to join their league. 
But he could give no satisfactory explanation of his neglect- 
ing to communicate to me, circumstances as intensely inter- 
esting to us, towards which I had a few months before di- 
rected his attention, and received a solemn assurance of his 
cheei'ful compliance with the instructions I had imposed on 
him. The result of all my inquiries on the subject is that 
the late combination was produced by British intrigue and 
influence in anticipation of war between them and the United 
States. It was however premature and ill-judged and the 
event sufliciently manifests either a great decline in their 
influence, or in the talents and address with which they have 
been accustomed to manage their Indian relations. The war- 
like and well armed Tribes of the Potawatamies, Ottawas, 
Chippewas, Delawares and Miamies, I believe neither had 
nor would have joined in the combination and altho the Kick- 
apoos whose warriors are better than those of any other 
Tribe, the remnant of the Wyandots excepted, are much under 
the influence of the Prophet, I am persuaded they never were 



 

made acquainted with his intentions, if they were really hos- 
tile to the United States. 

As you have done me the honor to request my opinion with 
respect to the position of the Troops destined to protect the 
Western frontiers. I will communicate the result of my re- 
flections on the subject with great pleasure. Such is the 
nature of Indian warfare, that I am persuaded one hundred 
thousand men would not be able to fomi a cordon along the 
frontiers of this Territory, Michigan and the State of Ohio 
sufficiently compact to preserve our settlements from their 
desultory attacks, in case of a general combination of the 
North Western Tribes against us. And any fort that is built 
with a view to form part of such a line of defence would in 
my opinion be useless. The chain of Forts begun by Genl. 
St. Clair and completed by Genl. [Anthony] Wayne extend- 
ing into the Indian countiy from the Ohio, and which were 
so situated as to cover the settlements from any attack but 
that of Indians, alforded not the least security to the in- 
habitants and were no further useful than as resting places 
for the small convoys which were employed to throw in 
provisions for the campaign at the head of the line. As we 
have no elevation in the whole extent of what was formerly 
the North Western Territory that can be dignified with the 
name of mountain, we have consequently no difficult passes 
such as the ancient world and some of the Atlantic states 
afford the securing of which would necessarily command the 
country for a considerable extent. 

There are, however, military positions to be found, which 
if properly improved would not only prevent the ingress of 
any regular force but effectually keep the Indians in check. 
Those are to be sought for along the greate water courses 
which bound the country on either side and on those ele- 
gant channels of communication, which nature has provided 
at Intervals to unite them. Without the aid of these the 
Bulky articles which make up the returns of the Indian Mer- 
chant, could never be taken out. The country being remark- 
ably flat, the roads are necessarily bad in winter and in the 
summer the immense prairies to the west and north of this 
produce such a multitude of flies as to render it impossible 
to make use of pack horses. Hence it follows that a few well 
selected positions on the straits which unite the Lakes, on 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 351 

the Mississippi and on the communications which connect 
them would completely control the Indian trade and conse- 
quently the Indians. I suppose the force to be stationed at 
Detroit, ought in some measure to be regulated by that kept 
by the British in the neighbouring fortress of Maiden. This 
has not I believe, for several years exceeded two weak com- 
panies and is at present reduced to one. The fort at Detroit 
can have little or no influence in controling the Indian Trade 
because it does not command the strait and if it did much 
the greater part of the trade is now and the whole could be 
carried on by the canoe route of the grand river. The proper 
position for our object is therefore to be sought for higher 
up. In case of a war with the U. S. and Great Britain the 
latter could never think of defending upper Canada, and no 
valuable purpose to them could be answered by a temporary 
possession of Detroit and the neighbouring settlements. I 
can therefore see no good reason for an accumulation of 
force at this point. A strong regular work to be garrisoned 
by two companies but capable of accommodating a Battalion, 
would I should imagine be amply sufficient. It would be 
highly desirable to have the Fort so situated as to command 
the ship channel of the Strait. When I was at Detroit in the 
year 1803 the British had and I believe still have 6 or 7 
armed vessels carrying from 8 to 22 guns on Lake Erie. 
With a part of this force and with the assistance of the 
Indians Macinac would be easily reduced as from its insular 
situation no reinforcement or supplies could reach it if the 
enemy possessed the superiority of naval force in the upper 
lakes. To prevent this, it will be necessary either to build 
a number of vessels equal to theirs or by fortifying the river 
of Detroit confine them to Lake Erie. A situation proper 
for this purpose was the object of my enquiry and Hog Island 
two miles above the Towai of Detroit was pointed out as the 
most eligible. There is also another favorable situation for 
commanding the navigation in the strait between Lake St. 
Clair and Lake Huron. 

As the canoe route at the grand river and Lake Nipissing 
to its entrance into Lake Huron is entirely within the British 
Territory the port of Michilimacinac is of considerable im- 
portance. It is here and at the neighbouring British port of 
St. Joseph's that the valuable trade which is borne along the 
route above mentioned and that which comes by the way of 



 

Detroit is parcelled out for the various directions which it 
afterwards assumes. In the event of a war with the British, 
it will be their first object to furnish the Tribes who espouse 
their cause with a sufficiency of arms and ammunition to ren- 
der them independent of a supply from us for several years. 
The port of Macinac with the aid of one or two small armed 
vessels would be a great check to the throwing in these sup- 
plies, but it could only be stoped entirely by erecting a work 
at the rapids of St. Mary, the pass leading into Lake Su- 
perior. This route into the Mississippi is not so good a one 
as that of the Fox River of Wisconsing but the one being 
secured and the other open would expose us to the same mis- 
chiefs as if neither were guarded. For the peace establish- 
ment of Macanac one well disciplined complete company, un- 
der a vigilant officer, would be sufficient. Of all the com- 
munications between the Lakes and the Mississippi that from 
Lake Michigan by the Fox and Wisconsing rivers is the most 
used and the most interesting and important. It is through 
this channel that nine tenths of the goods for the supply of 
the Indians above the Illinois river and in Louisiana is con- 
veyed and until we have a military force upon it, we can 
never control either the Traders or the Indians. I was so 
sensible of this, that at a Treaty which I made at St. Louis 
in the year 1804 with the Sacs and Foxes, I inserted a clause 
authorising the United States to build a Fort on either side 
the mouth of the Ouisconsing or on the opposite bank of 
Mississippi as the one or the other would afford the best site. 
I am convinced that great advantage would arise from a com- 
pany being stationed there. The village of Prairie du Chien 
consisting of about thirty French Families is three miles 
above. The Fort lately erected on the Mississippi near the 
mouth of the Demoins will serve as an intermediate post and 
support to that on the Ouisconsing. The site of the latter is, 
I am informed extremely bad, being commanded by higher 
ground within musket shot. The Post of Chicago is an im- 
portant one. It occupies the usual communications between 
Lake Michigan and the Mississippi by means of a short creek 
on which the Fort stands, and which actually takes its rise 
in the same lake or swamp with a branch of the Illinois River, 
so that in the spring boats with their loading pass freely 
from one to the other. The site of Fort Wayne was selected 
by General Washington ; to erect a fort there was the object 



 

of Genl. St. Clair's campaign. Its accomplishment by Genl. 
Wayne and a further knowledge of the country sufficiently 
evinced the wisdom of the choice. Proceeding from Fort 
Wayne to the Wabash and down that river at the distance 
of 150 miles from fort Wayne and 150 from this place, is the 
site of the old Wea Towns, where there is a considerable 
reservation of lands made by the Treaty of Greenville, for 
a Fort. The situation is beautiful and besides commanding 
the Wabash is near the mouth of the Tippecanoe which dis- 
charging itself into the former has its course in the neigh- 
bourhood of the Illinois and St. Joseph's of Lake Michigan 
to each of which there is a portage of nine and fourteen 
miles, much used by the Indians and sometimes by Traders. 
Notwithstanding these advantages I would not recommend 
the building of a Fort there. I think, however, that one 
other is necessary on the Wabash, but I should prefer it 
lower down, as near our boundary line as possible. The In- 
dians would be greatly dissatisfied at our occupancy of the 
Wea Towns and the giving up the reservation at that place 
would be a great inducement with the Weas to cede the coun- 
try they now live on between this place and the Vermillion 
River. There is no part of the Western country so much 
exposed as this. The Tribes in our neighbourhood (those 
which were confederated in the war terminated by General 
Wayne) are numerous, warlike and well armed and are more 
than a match for all the others, with whom we have inter- 
course, united. I believe, however, they have no idea of 
again measuring their strength with ours. No other in- 
fluence than that of the French could induce them to do it. 
But in the event of a French war (it) they could be led to 
believe that there was even a possibility that their efforts 
united to those of the French would again put the latter in 
possession of this country, the remembrance of all the calami- 
ties which and their frequent wars with us have brought upon 
them, and the justice and benevolence with which they have 
been treated since the peace would be insufficient to prevent 
their taking part against us. The happiness they enjoyed 
from their intercourse with the French is their perpetual 
theme — it is their golden age. Those who are old enough to 
remember it, speak of it with rapture, and the young ones 
are taught to venerate it as the Ancients did the reign of 
Saturn "you call us" said an old Indian chief to me "your 



 

Children why do you not make us happy as our Fathers the 
French did? They never took from us our lands, indeed 
they were in common with us — they planted where they 
pleased and they cut wood where they pleased and so did 
we — but now if a poor Indian attempts to take a little bark 
from a tree, to cover him from the rain, up comes a white 
man and threatens to shoot him, claiming the tree as his 
own." When the first information of the cession of Louisi- 
ana to France reached them they could not conceal their joy 
and I sincerely believe that the appearance of the first French 
uniform at St. Louis would have been a signal for a general 
revolt of all the tribes in this quarter, the Delawares ex- 
cepted. The present Garrison at Fort Knox is too near this 
town to be of as much advantage as if placed some distance 
above. A good situation could be found near our present 
boundary line, but if the fui-ther extinguishment of title, 
which I had the honor to propose to you, is accomplished, 
it might with propriety be placed still higher up. It appears 
to me, however, highly proper to have a company stationed 
some where in this neighbourhood. I can see no advantage 
in keeping up the garrison at Fort Massac, excepting as a 
depository for the stores destined for St. Louis. This pur- 
pose would, however be as well answered by a careful non 
commissioned officer and six men as with the present garrison. 
A show of force in the neighbourhood of St. Louis would cer- 
tainly contribute toward the neighbouring Tribes and if a 
whole regiment of infantry and one or two companies of 
artillery could be spared for the protection of Upper Louisiana 
and for garrisoning the post in this and the Illinois Terri- 
tories the Field and Staff of the Regiment with the balance 
of the Companies might with propriety be placed there — an 
arrangement of this kind would have a great tendency to 
preserve discipline and subordination. Pemiit me to recom- 
mend that in the forts that are far advanced in the Indian 
country, besides the deposit of six months provisions by the 
contractor, that there should constantly be kept two or three 
hundred bushels kiln dried corn to be annually renewed. No 
loss would arise from this measure, as the old deposit could 
be always sold to the Traders or Indians when the new should 
arrive. Contractors are so often negligent, and convoys of 
provisions passing for a considerable distance through a 
wilderness are subject to so many accidents that I have my- 



 

self known more than one instance where a Garrison was 
upon the point of being forced to abandon its charge for the 
want of food. 

Should my recommendations to place a company on the 
Wabash near this place be adopted I should be much grati- 
fied to have Lieut. [Ambrose} Whitlock who at present com- 
mands Fort Knox and is paymaster of the District continued. 
He served under my immediate command for several years 
and I will venture to pronounce that there is not a more 
zealous and attentive officer or one possessed of better prin- 
ciples in the service. He is now the oldest Lieutenant in his 
regiment, if there is not already a vacancy for him. There 
is also a surgeon's mate here, to whom it would be very con- 
venient to remain as his connections reside in this neighbour- 
hood. 

I have the honor to be with perfect respect Sir, your 
Humble Servt.

Hen: Pa. 235, 236 

Sir: 

Your letter of the 20th of December last requesting me to 
account for the unusual quantity of provisions issued to the 
Indians at this place in the months of June July and Aug. 
last I had not the honor to receive until this day week. I did 
myself the honor to inform you in my letter of the 1st of 
Sept. that I had been visited by the celebrated Shawnese 
Prophet. This person having announced to me his approach 
and understanding that he was accompanied by some hundreds 
of famished Indians of both sexes and being ever anxious to 
avoid every unnecessary expense I sent him a preremptory 
message requiring him to dismiss all his retinue 40 or 50 ex- 
cepted. This order he affected to obey but in 24 hours after 
his arrival the mass presented themselves exhibiting the most 
miserable set of starved wretches my eyes ever beheld. I had 
no alternative but to feed them, drive them out of the settle- 
ments with force or turn them loose upon the inhabitants. 



 

They possessed neither arms nor ammunition and if they had 
the wilderness at that season affords Httle or nothing. I gave 
them as Uttle as possible and got rid of them as soon as pos- 
sible. Mr. Wells was for having me starve all those which 
appertained to the prophet I did not believe however that 
that was the pilosophy of the President. I fed them and gave 
them a small supply of food and ammunition to take with them 
(partly in anticipation of the Shawene annuity). Whether 
this disbursement may prove to have been a politic one or not 
time will determine. I think it not impossible but it may — for 
I never knew an Indian that was not more grateful for having 
his belly filled than for any other service that could be ren- 
dered him. But at any rate I am certain of one thing that I 
have done for the best. Besides the Prophet and his party 
the whole of the Kickapoo, Piankeshaw and Wea Tribes were 
here in June and July to receive their annuities and being un- 
usually scarce of corn at their villages I was not able to get 
rid of them in as short a time as usual and many of the chiefs 
returned in August to assist at the Council with the Prophet. 

In managing the affairs of the Indian Department Sir, I act 
as I think the President would direct were he present and 
acquainted with all the circumstances. I am confident how- 
ever that I frequently err and I have no wish to have any- 
thing left to my discretion but what is absolutely unavoidable. 
And permit me to assure you that all your directions whether 
in unison with my own opinions or not shall be faithfully and 
punctually executed. 

I have the honor to be with the highest respect sir your 
humble servant

Sir: 

The President of the United States authorizes and instructs 
you to take advantage of the most favorable moment for ex- 
tinguishing the Indian title to the Lands lying east of the 



HARRISON: MESSACxES AND LETTERS 357 

Wabash and adjoining south on the Unes of the Treaties of 
Fort Wayne and Grouseland. The compensation to be paid 
for this extinguishment should not exceed the rate heretofore 
given for the Indiaji title to Lands in that quarter ; to prevent 
any future dissatisfaction, Chiefs of all the Nations who have 
or pretend right to these lands, should be present at the 
Treaty; and, if practicable, the cession should be obtained 
without leaving any reservations. It is discretionary with 
you to stipulate in what manner the consideration shall be 
paid ; whether in a gross sum payable after the ratification of 
the Treaty by instalments or in annuity for years or per- 
petuity, or partly in both these modes, as you may deem most 
expedient. The payment by instalments is preferred. For 
the expences attending the Treaty or Treaties, you will draw 
on this Department, except for the Provisions, which you will 
require of the Contractor, unless some other Person will agree 
to furnish them below Contract price. 

Besides reasonable expences, you will be allowed, six dol- 
lars per day and the Secretary to the Commission, should one 
be necessary, three dollars per day, while actually employed. 

A Diary of the proceedings should be kept by the Commis- 
sion or the Secretary, and a certified copy thereof, forwarded 
with the Treaty to this Department. 

I am, Sir, respectfully &c.

I have the honor to inform you that a Treaty was yesterday 
concluded with the Delaware, Potawatomie, Miami and Eel 
River Tribes by which they have ceded to the United States 
a Tract of land twelve miles wide along the boundary from 
fort Recovery, southwardly, to the boundary established by 
the Treaty of Grouseland, also a Tract between the boundary 
established at this place in 1803 and a line to be drawn from 
the mouth of Racoon Creek on the Wabash to the Grouseland 
extinguishment. This tract is believed to be about sixty miles 
in a direct line from our former boundary to the mouth of 
Racoon Creek and is to be thirty miles wide opposite to the 
north east corner of the Vincennes Tract, The Consent of the 
Wea Tribe is necessary to complete the title to the latter and 
that of the Kickapoos to a Tract of fifteen miles in width on 
the northwest side of the Wabash from our former boundary 
line up the River to a continuation of the line to be run from 
the Grouseland extinguishment to the mouth of Racoon Creek. 
These three Tracts will contain upwards of two millions and 
a half of acres and will cost less than two cents per acre, a 
complete History of our procedings will be forwarded from 
Vincennes for which, at present, time will not permit. I shall 
collect the Weas immediately on my return to Vincennes to

procure their consent of which there is httle doubt to the 
Treaty. That of the Kickapoos being not quite so certain 
nothing been announced for the Tract in which they are inter- 
ested. The assemblage of Indians has been greater at this 
Treaty than at any other since that of Greenville; the inci- 
dental expenses have of course has been considerable but the 
value of the land which has been purchased is much greater 
than any that has been heretofore procured.

" American State Papers, Indian Affairs I, 761 

A Treaty betw^een the United States of America and the 
TRIBES OF Indians called the Dela wares, Pattaw^ata- 
MiES, Miamies, and Eel River Miamies 
James Madison, President of the United States, by William 
Henry Harrison, Governor and Commander in Chief of the 
Indiana territory. Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and Com- 
missioner Plenipotentiary of the United States, for treating 
with the said Indian tribes, and the sachems, head-men, and 
warriors, of the Delaware, Pottawatamy, Miami, and Eel river 
tribes of Indians, have agreed and concluded upon the follow- 
ing treaty, which, when ratified by the said President, vdth 
the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States, 
shall be binding on said parties : 

Article 1. The Miami and Eel river tribes, and the Dela- 
wares and Pattawatamies, as their allies, agree to cede to the 
United States, all that tract of country which shall be included 
between the boundary line, established by the treaty of fort 
Wayne, the Wabash, and a line [the Ten-o-Clock line] to be 
drawn from the mouth of a creek called Racoon creek, empty- 
ing into the Wabash, on the southeast side, about twelve miles 
below the mouth of the Vermillion river, so as to strike the 
boundary line established by the treaty of Grouseland, at such 
a distance from its commencement, at the northeast corner of 
the Vincennes tract, as will leave the tract now ceded, thirty 
miles wide at the narrowest place; and also, all that tract 



 

which shall be included between the following boundaries, viz : 
Beginning at fort Recovery; thence, southwardly along the 
general boundary line, established by the treaty of Greenville, 
to its intersection \vith the boundary line established by the 
treaty of Grouseland ; thence, along said line, to a point from 
which a line drawn parallel to the first mentioned line will 
be twelve miles distant from the same, and along the said 
parallel line to its intersection with a line to be drawn from 
fort Recovery, parallel to the line established by the said 
treaty of Grouseland. 

Art. 2. The Miamies explicitly acknowledge the equal right 
of the Delawares, with themselves, to the country watered by 
the White river; but it is also to be clearly understood that 
neither party shall have the right of disposing of the same, 
without the consent of the other; and any improvements 
which shall be made on the said land by the Delawares, or 
their friends the Mohicans, shall be theirs forever. 

Ari. 3. The compensation to be given for the cession made 
in the first article, shall be as follows, viz. To the Delawares, 
a permanent annuity of five hundred dollars ; to the Miamies, 
a like annuity of five hundred dollars ; to the Eel river tribe, a 
like annuity of two hundred and fifty dollars; and to the 
Pattawatamies, a like annuity of five hundred dollars. 

Art. U- All the stipulations made in the treaty of Green- 
ville, relatively to the manner of paying the annuities, and the 
right of the Indians to hunt upon the land, shall apply to the 
annuities granted and the land ceded by the present treaty. 

Art. 5. The consent of the Wea tribe shall be necessary to 
complete the title to the first tract of land here ceded. A sepa- 
rate convention shall be entered into between them and the 
United States, and a reasonable allowance of goods given them 
in hand, and a permanent annuity, which shall not be less than 
three hundred dollars, settled upon them. 

Art. 6. The annuities promised by the third article, and 
the goods now delivered, to the amount of five thousand two 
hundred dollars, shall be considered as a full compensation 
for the cession made in the first article. 

Art. 7. The tribes who are parties to this treaty, being de- 
sirous of putting an end to the depredations which are com- 
mitted by abandoned individuals of their own color, upon the 
cattle, horses, &c. of the more industrious and careful, agree to 
adopt the following regulations viz: When any theft or other 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 361 

depredation shall be committed by any individual or indi- 
viduals of one of the tribes, above mentioned, upon the prop- 
erty of any individual or individuals of another tribe, the 
chiefs of the party injured shall make application to the agent 
of the United States, who is charged with the delivery of the 
annuities of the tribe to which the offending party belongs, 
whose duty it shall be to hear the proofs and allegations on 
either side, and determine between them; and the amount of 
his award shall be immediately deducted from the annuity of 
the tribe to which the offending party belongs, and given to 
the person injured, or the chief of his village, for his use. 

Art. 8. The United States agree to relinquish their right 
to the reserve at the old Ouiatanon towns, made by the treaty 
of Greenville, so far, at least, as to make no further use of it 
than for the establishment of a military post. 

Ai't. 9. The tribes who are parties to this treaty, being 
desirous to shew their attachment to their brothers, the Kicka- 
poos, agree to cede to the United States, the lands on the 
northwest side of the Wabash, from the Vincennes tract, to a 
northwardly extension of the line running from the mouth of 
the aforesaid Racoon creek, and fifteen miles in width from 
the Wabash, on condition that the United States, shall allow 
them an annuity of four hundred dollars; but this article is 
to have no effect, unless the Kickapoos will agree to it. 

In testimony whereof, the said William Henry Harrison, 
and the sachems and war chiefs of the before mentioned tribes, 
have hereunto set their hands, and affixed their seals, at Fort 
Wayne, this thirtieth of September, one thousand eight hun- 
dred and nine.

enumerated in the title.) 

Sept. 30, 1809 

A separate Article, entered into at Fort Wayne, on the 30th 
day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight 
hundred and nine, between William Henry Harrison, Com- 
missioner Plenipotentary of the United States for treating 
with the Indian tribes, and the sachems and chief warriors of 
the Miami and Eel river tribes of Indians, which is to be con- 
sidered as forming part of the treaty this day concluded, be- 



 

tween the United States and the said tribes, and their allies, 
the Delawares and the Pattawatamies. 

As the greater part of the lands ceded to the United States 
by the treaty, this day concluded, was the exclusive property 
of the Miami nation, and guarantied to them by the treaty 
of Grouseland, it is considered by the said commissioner, just 
and reasonable that their request to be allowed some further 
and additional compensation should be complied with : It is, 
therefore, agreed, that the United States shall deliver, for 
their use, in the course of the next spring, at fort Wayne, 
domestic animals to the amount of five hundred dollars, and 
the like number for the two following years; and that an 
armorer shall be also maintained at fort Wayne, for the use 
of the Indians, as heretofore: It is also agreed that, if the 
Kickapoos confirm the ninth article of the treaty to which this 
is a supplement, the United States will allow to the Miamies a 
further permanent annuity of two hundred dollars, and to the 
Wea and Eel river tribes, a further annuity of one hundred 
dollars each. 

In testimony ivhereof, the said William Henry Harrison, 
and the sachems and war chiefs of the said tribes, have here- 
unto set their hands, and affixed their seals, the day and place 
above mentioned. 

William Henry Harrison. (L. S.) 

(Signed also by certain chiefs and warriors of said tribes of 
Indians.) 

Journal of the Proceedings at the Indian Treaty at Fort 
Wayne and Vincennes September 1 to October 27, 1809 
On Friday the 1st of September Governor Harrison as Com- 
missioner for Treating with the Indian Tribes set out from 
Vincennes for Fort Wayne accompanied by his secretary Peter 
Jones one Interpreter [Joseph Barron] a French Man as a 
guide a Servant of the Governor & two Indians. After leaving 
the Settlement of Knox County our route was along the road 
newly cut out by the orders of the Government in the direction 
of the North Bend to its termination, & then along the frontier 
of the County of Dearborn to Fort Wayne, at which place we 
arrived on the fifteenth [September]. Directions had been 
given to Mr. John Johnston the Indian Agent to assemble the 
Indians, against that time. The deliware Tribe (vdth their 



 

Interpreter) Mr. John Conner reached Fort Wayne at the very 
moment of our arrival. Two principal Chiefs Hocking- 
pomscon and the Beaver were however absent on a visit to 
Detroit. 

16th. Part of the Putawatimies arrived under their Chief 
Winnemack. 

The Governor learned with regret that the head Chief 
Tipinipe [Topenebe] of the Putawatimies & Five Medals 
[Onoxa] were not returned from Detroit but authorized their 
son & nephew to act for them. In the evening the Eel River 
Tribe arrived & more of the Putawatimies. 17th. The 
Miami Chief Peccan, Owl, Osage and some inferior ones 
arrived. A messenger was sent for the little Turtle who re- 
turned for answer that he would come in on the 19th Inst. 
A mischievous report was circulated amongst the Indians that 
a Detachment of American Troops were marching against 
them. Some of the young men were much frightened but the 
Chiefs treated it with the ridicule it deserved. The Puta- 
watimies waited on the Governor & requested a little liquor 
which was refused. The Governor observed that he was de- 
termined to shut up the liquor casks until all the business was 
finished. 18th. An express was dispatched to Detroit to hasten 
the arrival of the Deliware & Putawatimie Chiefs who had 
gone to that place & whose presence was very much desired by 
the Governor. Mr. [Joseph] Barron the Interpreter was also 
sent to the Miami Towns sixty miles distant to bring Richai'd- 
ville the Principal Chief of that Tribe who had excused himself 
under pretence of real or pretended sickness from comeing in 
with the other Chiefs. 

The Governor had a conference with a Deputation from the 
Deliwares who reside west of the Mississippi who came for the 
purpose of prevailing on those of that Tribe who reside in this 
Territory to join their brethren in Louisiana. A reciprocal 
promise was made by the Governor to promote the above ob- 
ject as much as possible and by the Chiefs to aid his views in 
respect to the proposed Treaty. Measures were taken also 
to explain the wishes of the Government to the Putawatamies 
& to engage their cooperation. More of the Putawatamies & 
Miamies arived the whole number on the ground this day was 
eight hundred and ninety-two. 

19th. The Turtle arrived this day with a number of 
Miamies & Putawatamies. The Governor visited the Puta- 



 

watimies in their Camp as he had previously done the Deli- 
wares. Measures were also taken to sound several of the 
most influential Chiefs on the subject of the proposed Treaty. 
Captain Hendricks the Mohecan Chief informed the Governor 
that the British Agent of Indian Affairs had advised all the 
Indian Tribes never to listen to any proposition to sell their 
lands to the United States. Pinnewa a Putawatimie Chief 
arrived with one hundred Indians of his Tribe. 

20th. The Governor had a conference with all the Miami 
& Eel River Chiefs & explained to them at great length the 
object of his visit to this place and the great advantage which 
they would derive from causeing the Weas to move from the 
neighborhood of our Settlements and join their brethren the 
Miamies & Eel River Tribes (these three tribes are all prop- 
erly speaking Miamies — see the Treaty of Grouseland) Their 
Nation would then become much more respectable and they 
would be enabled greatly to increase their annuity by selling 
a tract of land which was exhausted of game and which was 
no longer useful to them. They were desired to take the Gov- 
ernor's proposal into consideration & Coolly & deliberately to 
weigh all the arguments he had used to adopt his advice. Mr. 
[William] Wells remained with them at their conference and 
in the evening reported to the Governor that they had deter- 
mined on no account ever to part from another foot of their 
lands. There is some reason to believe however that this was 
a mere finesse to enhance the price of their land. This even- 
ing Mr. Barron returned from the Mississinway & reported 
that the Chief Richardville was confined to his Bed & observed 
that it was impossible for him to attend at present but he re- 
quested the Governor to be informed that he would come up 
in a few days if he should find himself able & that he had ad- 
vised the other Chiefs by all means to comply with Governor's 
wishes. 21st. The Governor had determined not to assemble 
the Chiefs in a General Council until the arrival of the Five 
Medals, the Putawatimie Chief, but finding that his object had 
been very much misrepresented to them, he commenced on this 
day both to the Deliwares & Putawatimies the wishes of the 
Government in relation to a further cession of Lands. 

In the eveening the Putawatamie Chiefs sent a message to 
the Governor to inform him that they had determined that the 
other Tribes should agree to make the proposed cession. 

227id. In Council present, Governor Harrison as Commis- 



 

sioner plenipotentiary on the part of the United States and a 
full representation of the Deliware, Miami, Eel River & Puta- 
watamie Tribes of Indians by their Chiefs & Head Men. 

William Wells, Joseph Barron, John Conner, and Abraham 
Ash were sworn Interpreters. The Governor addressed the 
Chiefs in a speech of considerable length showing the propri- 
ety of their agreeing to his proposition to sell a tract of 
Country binding on the Wabash the Vincennes tract and the 
boundary established by the Treaty of Grouseland and another 
bounded by the latter on the South & the old boundary line 
running from Mouth of Kentucky River on the East. He 
urged the vast benefit which they derived from their annuities 
without which they would not be able to cloathe their woman 
& children. The great advance in the price of Goods and the 
depression of the value of their peltries from the troubles in 
Europe to which their was no probability of a speedy termma- 
tion. The little game which remained in their country par- 
ticularly in that part of it which he proposed to purchase. 
The usurpation of it by a Banditti of Muscoes [Muscogees] & 
other Tribes that the sale of it would not prevent them from 
hunting upon it as long as any game remained. But that it 
was absolutely necessary that they should adopt some other 
plan for their support. That the raising of Cattle & Hogs 
required little labor and would be the surest resourse as a 
substitute for the wild animals which they had so unfortu- 
nately destroyed for the sake of their skins. Their fondness 
for hunting might still be gratified if they would prevent their 
young men from hunting at improper season of the year. 
But to do this effectually it will be necessary that they should 
find a certain support in their Villages in the summer season. 
That the proposed addition to their annuities would enable 
them to procure the Domestic Animals necessary to commence 
raising them on a large scale. He observed also that they 
were too apt to impute their poverty and the scarcity of Game 
to the encroachments of the White Settlers. But this is not 
the true cause. It is owing to their own improvidence & the 
advice of the British Traders by whom they were stimulated 
to kill the wild animals for the skins alone when the flesh was 
not wanted. That this was the cause of their scarcity is evi- 
dent from their being found in much greater quantity on the 
south than on the north side of the Wabash where no white 
man but traders were ever seen. 



 

The remnant of the Weas who inhabit the Tract of Country 
which was wanted were from the vicinity to the Whites poor 
& miserable all the proceeds of their hunts & the part of their 
annuities expended in Whiskey. The Miami Nation would be 
much more respectfible & formidable if its scattered members 
were all assembled in the center of their Country. 

A rough sketch of the Country in which the two tracts 
which were wanted were particularly delineated was shewn to 
them, after which the Owl a Miami Chief addressed the 
Governor. 

Father we are very happy to hear your address. We shall 
take what you have said into consideration & will return you 
an answer. 

23rd. The Chiefs met in Council at the Deliware Camp to 
consider the Governor's proposition it was understood that 
the Putawatimies declared unequivocally in favour of the sale 
and were seconded by the Deliwares. The miamies remained 
silent. The Governor had a private interview with the Turtle 
who expressed some solicitude to know whether the dismission 
of Mr. Wells from his employment as Agent would effect his 
standing with the Government. The Governor assured him 
that he should be treated in all respect as he had heretofore so 
long as he conducted himself with propriety. He then assured 
the Governor unequivocally that he would exert himself to the 
utmost of his power to effect the proposed Treaty, but that 
many difficulties were to be encountered before it could be ac- 
complished. That great complaints were made by the Indians 
on account of the compensation formerly allowed. That those 
who were in favour of the Treaty were decidedly of opinion 
that they aught to be allowed for the larger tribes at least a 
further annuity of $1000 & for the smaller ones $500 besides 
a considerable sum in hand. In the evening the Miami chiefs 
waited on the Governor at his lodgings and spent the evening 
with him. They requested to have a little liquor for their 
young men. Two Gallons were given to each Tribe. A 
Potawatomie Chief Winemack waited on the Governor late 
in the evening and told him that he came to make him sleep 
well by communicating the agreeable information that his 
proposition would be acceeded to by the Indians. 

2ith. The Indians met in Council to determine upon the 
answer to be given to the Governor. When the Miamies de- 
clared their determination not to sell a foot of Land. Observ- 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 367 

ing that it was time to put a stop to the encroachments of the 
whites who were eternally purchasing their lands for less than 
the real value of them. That they had also heard that the 
Governor had no instructions from the President to make the 
purchase but that he was making it upon his own authority 
to please the White people whom he governed. The Puta- 
watimies vehemently urged the sale & reproached the Miamies 
in the most bitter terms. That the Putawatimies had taken 
the Miamies under their protection when they were in danger 
of being exterminated & saved them. That they had always 
agreed to the sale of lands for the benefit of the Miamies and 
they were now determined that the Miamies should sell for 
their benefit. 

The Delawares would take no active part on either side. 

25th. All the Tribes were assembled in Council and the 
Governor addressed them as follows 
My Children 

My Heart is oppressed. If I could have believed that I 
should have experienced half of the mortification and disap- 
pointment which I now feel, I would have entreated your 
Father the President to have chosen some other Representa- 
tive to have made kno\vn his wishes to you. The proposi- 
tion which I have made you, I fondly hoped would have been 
acceptable to all, because I knew it would be beneficial to all. 
When then this disagreement amongst you. Is there some 
evil spirit amongst us? That has set Brothers against Broth- 
ers & the Children against the Father? The Wind I hear 
has blown from the North, no good has every yet come from 
that quarter. If we who inhabit this great Island, who were 
born here, are not friends to each other, who will be our 
Friends. 

Believe my Children the people upon the other side of the 
big water would desire nothing better than to set us once 
more to cut each others throats. Glad enough would they be 
to see us contending against each other in battle provided 
they were secured behind the Walls of a strong fort. Miamies 
be not offended with your brothers the Putawatimies. If they 
have discovered too much eagerness to comply with the wishes 
of their Father, look at their Woman & Children see them 
exposed to the winds & the rain as they will be in a short 
time to the snows of the Winter. Putawatimies do not suflFer 
your love for your Father and your own distresses to make 



 

you angry with your brothers the Miamies. I know that they 
are attached to you. I am sure that everything will yet be 
fixed to your satisfaction. 

Chiefs & Warriors of the Deliware. I have put confidence 
in you and you have not deceived me, you have united with 
your Children the Puttawatimies to accomplish the wishes of 
your Father, he will remember you for it. The proceedings 
of this Council written by the Secretary will be sent to him, 
his eyes will see it & whenever you take him by the hand you 
will know that his heart is yours. Your brothers on the Mis- 
sissippi shall also feel the good effects of your fathers affec- 
tion for you. 

I promise you that the Osages shall not molest you in your 
hunting grounds. 

My Children the Miamies, what disconcerts You? Have 
you not always received justice from the hands of your 
father? What is it he asks of you? Nothin but what you 
can spare. Will not your situation be made better by agree- 
ing to his proposal? I know that you have long desired to 
have your brothers the Weas alongside of you. It will add 
to your strength — at present they are of no use to you — 
bring your scattered members together & you will be strong, 
besides there is danger that this distant member may fall off 
it is already weakened by the excessive use of liquor. My 
Children your father will never be the cause of breaking the 
chain of friendship that connects you with each other. 

Puttawatimies & Miamies look upon each other as brothers 
and at the same time look upon your grand fathers the Del- 
wares. I love to see you all united. I wish a strong chain 
to bind you all together in the bonds of friendship. I wish 
to hear you speak with one voice the dictates of your Heart. 
All must go together. The consent of all is necessary. 

Deliwares and Putawatimies, I told you that I would do 
nothing with the Miamies without your consent. Miamies I 
now tell you that nothing can be done without your consent. 
The consent of the whole is necessary. This is the first re- 
guest your new Father (President Madison) has ever made 
you it will be the last, he wants no more of your land agree 
to the proposition which I now make you & send on some of 
your wise men to take him by the hand. He will set your 
Heart at ease. He will tell you that he will never make an- 
other proposition to you to sell your lands. 



 

My Children the Miamies will not listen to the recommenda- 
tion of your grand fathers the Deliwares & your brothers the 
Puttawatimies. Consult together once more if any ill will 
remain in your breasts against each other banish it, throw 
it away, and return a favorable answer to this last request of 
your Father. 

The Turtle a Miami Chief then spoke as follows 

We have listened to what our Father has said. Putawati- 
mies and Deliwares we have hard him say that you were united 
for the purpose of complying with his wishes I am sorry 
that he has met with so much difficulty. It is true that we 
the Miamies are not united with the Deliwares and Puta- 
watimies in opinion. Father it appears that the thing is now 
left with the Miamies, they will withdraw and consult to- 
gether and after they have made up their minds you shall 
hear our answer. 

In the evening the Miami Chiefs from two Villages met 
with the Eel River Chiefs under the auspices of the Turtle 
& agreed to meet the Governor's wishes. 

26th. A meeting of the several Tribes took place. The 
Putawatimies ui'ged an immediate compliance to the pro- 
posal of the United States. The Miamies from Mississinway 
took the lead in the debate & declared that they would no 
longer consider them as Brothers but that they would loose 
the chain which had united them with the Tomahawk & 
setting up a shout of Defiance which was echoed by all the 
warriors proceeded immediately to the Council House to in- 
form the Governor of what they had done, the Governor 
blamed them for their rashness & made them promise not 
to offer the Miamies any further insult to put their cause in 
his hands. 

It appeard that such of the Miamies as had determined in 
favour of the Treaty were intimidated by the vehemence of 
the Chiefs of the Mississinway Village & remained silent. 
During the whole of this day and the preceding one, parties 
of young men of the Miami Tribe were constantly ariving 
loaded with goods from the British Agents at Maiden and 
charged also with strong remonstrances against the proposed 
Treaty. 

In the evening the Governor had the greater part of the 
Miami Chiefs at his lodgings and in a conversation of some 



 

hours exposed profidious conduct of the British towards 
them from the commencement of the Revolutionary War until 
the present moment. "To them all their misfortunes were 
to be attributed & their present kindness to them proceeded 
from no other cause but a wish to embroil them with the 
United States. In case of a War with the latter, the English 
know that they are unable to defend Canada with their own 
force, they are therefore desirous of interposing the Indians 
between them and danger." A complimentary answer was 
returned by the Head Chief Paccon & they returned about 
ten o'clock a little melowed with Wine. 

27th. The Miami Chiefs were this day debating on the 
proposed Treaty, the Chief Silver heels particularly distin- 
guished himself in favour of the Treaty. They came how- 
ever to no decision. In the evening the Governor recom- 
mended to the Putawatimies to accommodate their difference 
with the Miamies they immediately assented & a proper belt 
of Wampon was prepared for the purpose. 

28th. The Putawatimies & Miamies met & the bad words 
spoken by the former on the 26th being recalled they shook 
hands and became again friends. The proposed Treaty was 
again taken under consideration and various objections were 
started by the Miamies amongst other things it was insisted 
that they ought to sell their lands by the acre & that they 
should receive two Dollars for it. In the evening the Gov- 
ernor was informed that they had agreed to sell the small 
tract near Fort Recovery only, and none on the Wabash. 

29th. In Council present the Governor and the Deliware, 
Putawatimies, Miamies & Eel River Miamies. 
The Owl a Miami Chief 

Said That it had pleased the great Spirit to unite again 
all who were present in the bands of friendship. Yesterday 
the friendship was all afloat today it is made firm. You the 
people of the United States have assembled us all here, our 
Chiefs, &c. You remember the time when we first took each 
other by the hand at Greenville. You there told us where 
the line would be between us. You told us to love our woman 
& children and take care of our lands, you told us that the 
Spanish had a great deal of money the English & some of 
your people likewise, but that we should not sell our lands 
to any of them. In consequence of which last fall we all put 
our hands upon our lands & determined not to sell our lands. 



 

We all love our lands. After this determination you sent for 
us at the end of one year but we did not expect to hear from 
you what we have heard, but we yesterday determined to 
give you an answer. You have told us not to let any person 
have our lands but consider well before we sell them. This 
was good advice, you know when things are scarce they are 
dear, you know the price of lands. We are willing to sell 
you some for the price that it sells for amongst yourselves. 
The land you want on the Wabash we have nothing to say 
to at present as the Weas are not here. If people have any- 
thing that they do not want they will part from it easily. We 
yet find game on this land. When there is none. We will 
let you know it. Father you know the Miamies, you know 
that when they do business with any other Indians no re- 
spect is paid to what they say. Father at this Council you 
have told the Miamies to speak. We therefore expect that 
you will be governed by what they say. When you spoke to 
us you wished that we should comply. We now wish that you 
would comply with what we \vish. The land we propose sell- 
ing to you will be measured and when it is we wish to be 
present. Father the land you mentioned to us on the Wabash 
we have nothing to say about. We do not wish you to go 
home unsuccessful. We will let you have some land near 
Fort Recovery, the land on the Wabash our younger Brothers 
occupy. Dont be dissatisfied. This is our determination. We 
have disputed about your proposal but our disputes were for- 
tunately settled yesterday. Father you know everything, you 
will immediately understand what I now say — we wish to 
keep our people and yours as far as possible from the White 
people, we know that when your Horses are lost you blame 
the Indians, we wish to keep our people and yours as separate 
as possible. This is the sentiments of your Children here 
present. We have nothing more to say. Our Chiefs, War- 
riors, Woman & Children salute you, the former annuity due 
to us by the United States we have come to receive and wish 
them delivered as soon as possible. 

The Governor then addressed them in a speech of two hou;-s 
in which he gave a History of the Conduct of the United 
States towards the red people contrasted with that of Great 
Britain. "The loss of the country from Pittsburgh to the 
Miami was entirely to be attributed to the latter who urged 
the Indians to commence all those Wars, which had terminated 



 

so fatally to them. If all the lands which had been taken 
from them in those Wars which they had engaged in by the 
advice of the British had been sold on the same terms as 
those ceded since the Treaty of Greenville their Annuity would 
now have been equal to all their wantes nor would they have 
to lament the numerous warriors who had fallen in fighting 
the battles of the English. How different was the conduct 
of the United States? Consious of their ability to punish 
their enemies they had never asked the assistance of their 
red children but have always advised them to remain at peace 
in their Cabbins & suffer the white people to fight their own 
battles." The Governor explained to them the nature of a 
Treaty "No other power but the United States had ever 
Treated with them. Other Civilized Nations considered the 
lands of the Indians as their o\\m and appropriated them to 
their own use whenever they pleased. A Treaty was con- 
sidered by white people as a most solemn thing and those 
which were made by the United States with the Indian Tribes 
were considered as binding as those which were made with 
the most powerful Kings on the other side of the Big Water. 
They were all concluded with the same forms and printed in 
the same Book so that all the world might see them and 
brand with infamy the party which violated them. The 
United States would always adhere to their engagements. To 
do otherwise would be offensive to the great spirit and all 
the world would look upon them as a faithless people. With 
respect to your selling the land by the acre it is entirely out 
of the question. But if the United States were to agree to 
it, you have no one that could survey it for you or who could 
tell whether it was accurately done or not. If it was sold by 
the acre we would only take what was good and leave the 
rest upon your hands. When it is bought in the large quan- 
tity you are paid for good and bad together and you all 
know that in every tract that is purchased that there is a 
great portion of bad land not fit for our purpose. This idea 
must have been suggested to you by some person who is as 
much your enemy as the enemy of the United States." The 
Governor then told them that he was tired of waiting and 
that on the next day he would submit to them the form of a 
Treaty which he wished them to sign and if they would not 
agree to it he would extinguish the council fire. 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 373 

WiNEMACK a Putawatimie Chief then addressed the Gov- 
ernor as follows 

Father 

All the Putawatimies address you, listen to what they say, 
which come from them all. Father the Putawatimies are of 
the same opinion that they have ever been, that your proposi- 
tion is right and just. We all know that our Father never 
deceived us., We therefore agree to his proposal. All the 
Chiefs & Warriors have heard you say that they may go and 
see their great Father the President and that he would tell 
them as you have done. 

You have now heard the sentiments of all the Putawati- 
mies. Father after we conclude the Treaty some of our young 
men would be glad to go and see their Father. Father your 
Children have listened to you with attention all that you have 
said is good, you have asked for land, we will give it to you. 
We have heard you say that the piece of land at Wea Towns 
which we had formerly given, you were willing to restore 
this has made us happy we have always heard from you and 
our Father JetTerson nothing but good. We wish to concur 
with all the nations who are present. We your children con- 
sider the land as belonging to us all not to one nation alone, 
we know that everything you have said to us is true. You 
have also recommended to us to be moderate & friendly to 
each other. 

A Deliware Chief then arose and observed that the Deli- 
wares had always kept fast hold of the chain of friendship 
which united them to the seventeen fires at the Treaty of 
Greenville. That they had always listened to the voice of 
their Father and were now willing to agree to his proposals. 

As soon as the Putawatimie Chief began to speak all the 
Mississinway Miamies left the Council House. 

30th. It was now the opinion of all the Gentlemen about 
the Fort that the Missisinway Miamies could never be brought 
to sign the Treaty and all the attempts which the Governor 
had made through the Interpreters and some confidential 
Chiefs to find out the real cause of their obstinacy had hith- 
erto failed. He therefore determined to make them a visit 
to their camp in person for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether their opposition proceeded from a fixed determina- 
tion (as they had asserted) not to sell any more lands unless 
they could get two Dollars pr. Acre, or some other cause which 



 

he might be enabled to remove. He accordingly went to their 
camp about sun rise attended only by his Interpreter Mr. 
Barron in whose integrity he had the utmost confidence. He 
was received by all the Chiefs with the utmost complacency 
and having collected them all in the Tent of the principal he 
told them "that he had paid them that visit not as the Repre- 
sentative of the President but as an old friend with whom 
they had been many years acquainted and who always en- 
deavored to promote their happiness by every means in their 
power. That he plainly saw that there was something in 
their hearts which was not consistent with the attachment 
which they ought to bear to their great Father and he was 
afraid that they had listened to bad birds. That he had come 
there for the purpose of hearing every cause of complaint 
against the United States and he would not leave them untill 
they laid open everything that oppressed their Hearts. He 
knew that they could have no solid objection to the proposed 
Treaty for they were all men of sense and reflection and well 
knew that they would be much benefited by it." The Gov- 
ernor requested all the Chiefs present would speak in their 
turn, and calling upon the principal Chief of the Eel River 
Tribe who was an old friend of his that had served with him 
in General Waynes Army he demanded what his objections 
were to the Treaty. He drev.^ out the Treaty of Grouseland. 
"Father — Here are your own words, in this paper you prom- 
ised that you would consider the Miamies as the owners of 
the land on the Wabash why then are you about to purchase 
it from others? The Governor assured them that it never 
was his intention to purchase the land from the other Tribes 
that he had always said and was ready now to confess that 
the land belonged to the Miamies and to no other Tribe that 
if the other Tribes had been invited to the Treaty it was at 
their particular request (The Miamies). The Putawatimies 
had indeed taken higher ground than either the Governor or 
the Miamies expected they claimed an equal right to the lands 
in question with the Miamies, but what of this their claiming 
it gave them no right and it was not the intention of the 
Governor to put an>i;hing in the Treaty which would in the 
least alter their claim to their lands on the Wabash, as es- 
tablished by the Treaty of Grouseland unless they chose to 
satisfy the Deliwares with respect to their claim to the Coun- 
try Watered by the White River. That even the whole com- 



 

pensation proposed to be given for the land would be given 
to the Miamies if they insisted upon it but that they knew 
the offence which this would give to the other Tribes and that 
it was always Governor's intention so to draw up the Treaty 
that the Putawatiniies & Deliwares would be considered as 
participating in the advantages of the Treaty as allies of the 
Miamies not as having any right to the land." Every coun- 
tenance brightened at this declaration, the other Chiefs spoke 
in their turn, each had some grievance to complain of. They 
had been told that justice should be done to them in their 
disputes with the White People, the Principal War Chief com- 
plained that he had been cheated by a Mr. [Peter] Audrain 
in connection of Mr. Wells out of seventy Dollars that he had 
in vain applied to Wells for redress, the old story of the 
Spirits seized by Wells was again brought forward and a 
very strong antipathy both to Wells and the Turtle was mani- 
fested by all. The Governor had no alternative but to prom- 
ise immediate satisfaction for these claims and to assure 
them that he perfectly understood and admitted that they the 
(Mississinway Chiefs) were the real Representatives of the 
Miami Nation and that he should always consider them as 
such. Some attempts were then made to induce the Governor 
to alter his determination with respect to the quantum of 
compensation to be given for the land but finding that the 
Governor was immovable as to this point they gave it up and 
after dissultory conversation upon the Governor's demanding 
whether they were entirely satisfied Paean the principal Chief 
told the Governor he might go to the Fort and they would 
shortly wait upon him with good news. The Treaty was im- 
mediately prepared and in full council at which all the War- 
riors attended, the Treaty was signed without a single ob- 
jection excepting on the part of the Turtle who objected to 
the article which gives the Mohecans the right to settle on 
the White River. The Other Miami Chiefs however declared 
in favour of it and the Turtle gave it up. 

The separate article with the Miamies had been agreed on 
before upon their consenting to the Article in the original 
Treaty which embraces the Kickappos. 

October the first, second and third the Governor was em- 
ployed in delivering the annuities for the present year. The 
Goods promised by the late Treaty and arranging the claims 



 

of certain Citizens against the Indians & those of the In- 
dians against the Citizens for Horses stolen and other depre- 
dations all which were amicably adjusted. When the Goods 
for the Putawatamies were laid out Viz: fifteen hundred 
Dollars from the public store & five hundred Dollars of their 
annuity which had been sent to Fort Wayne seeing that their 
pile was so much less than the Miamies they refused to take 
them alledging that their numbers were greater than all the 
other Tribes present put together & that the"y had less goods 
than any. As soon as the Governor was informed of this he 
assembled all the Chiefs & Warriors in the Council House 
and explained to them the reason of their having but five 
hundred Dollars of their present years annuity part having 
been sent to Detroit & part to Chicago. After some con- 
sultation they agreed to take the Goods but as the Governor 
discovered that they were not satisfied he agreed to advance 
them five hundred Dollars in anticipation of their next years 
annuity. 

Uh. We set out on our return to Vincennes through the 
Indian Country on the morning of the 5th passed the Camp 
of Paean the principal Miami Chief & found one of his men 
mortally wounded in a drunken frolick the preceding night. 
The Chiefs informed the Governor that they had not dis- 
covered the murderer. The Governor recommended to them 
by all means to punish him when discovered if it should ap- 
pear to have proceeded from previous malice, but if it should 
appear to be altogether accident to let him know it and he 
would assist to make up the matter with the friends of the 
deceased. 

Passing through the Indian Villages at the Forks of the 
Wabash we arrived at Mississinway on the 6th where we 
were hospitably received by Richardville the Grand Sachem 
of the Miamies who expressed his entire satisfaction at the 
conclusion of the Treaty. At the Eel River Village on the 
Raviere [Petit] we met with some of the Wea Tribe whom 
the Governor sent to collect the Wea Chiefs & conduct them 
to Vincennes at which place we arrived on the 12th October. 

The whole number of Indians present the day the Treaty 
was sig-ned was thirteen hundred and ninety. 

On the fifteenth of October Lapoussier the principal Chief 
of the Weas arrived [at Vincennes] with fifteen of his Tribe. 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 377 

The Little Eyes & some others on the 18th, Shawnee and 
others on the 19th & the Negro legs on the 22d. In all on 
that day there were sixty-one. 

2Uth- The Governor assembled in the evening at his own 
house all the Indians and informed them "that he wished to 
see them to discover whether they were in a situation to 
understand the important business which He had to lay be- 
fore them. He had shut up the liquor casks, but he was sory 
to see that some bad white men had disregarded his Procla- 
mation & secretly furnished them with the means of intoxi- 
cation. He was glad however to find that they were then all 
sober & he hoped that they would not drink any more until 
the business on which he assembled them was finished. On 
the morrow he would explain to them the proceedings of the 
Council at Fort Wayne." 

25th. The Wea Chiefs being all assembled the Governor 
produced the Treaty lately made at Fort Wayne and ex- 
plained it to them. He then represented to them "the ad- 
vantages they would derive from removeing from the neigh- 
borhood of Vincennes and settling higher up the Count 
with their older brothers the Miamies and the great assist- 
ance that they would derive from the proposed addition to 
their annuity & the Goods which they were to receive in hand 
and which would be the same as larger Tribes received in 
consequence of the inconvenience they would suflfer by re- 
moving from their present habitations. 

26th. The Chiefs of the Weas all assembled & after some 
explanations with respect to the Treaty & a most urgent 
appeal from the Negro legs to the Governor's feelings on the 
subject of the injury done to the Indians by the sale of 
Whisky by the Wliite people for which they received in pay- 
ment Articles indispencible to the subsistance of the former 
& those which would cover their nakedness. The Treaty 
was chearfully signed by every Chief & head Warrior present. 

27th. The Goods were delivered and on the 29th the chiefs 
again met the Governor & expressed their satisfaction at 
what had been done & most earnestly entreated "that some 
means might be fallen on to put a stop to the sale of Ardent 
Spirits to the Indians — Which prevented the Annuity granted 
them by the United States from affording them that benefit 
which their father wished & caused the young men to be so 



 

disobedient to their Chiefs that it is impossible to restrain 

them." 

The above is a true statement of the proceedings at the 

Treaties concluded with the several Indian Tribes at Fort 

Wayne on the 30th September last and with the Weas at 

Vincennes on the 26th Ultimo/

Annual Message Third General Assembly 

October 17, 1809 

Vincennes Western Sun, October 21, 1809 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the 
House of Representatives :^ 
The happy change which has been effected in our constitu- 
tion by the act of Congress, which gives to the people the 
choice of the members of the Legislative Council and the Dele- 
gate to Congress, is a subject of felicitation to every friend 
to the happiness and prosperity of the Territory. This act is 
alone sufficient to prove the parental care of our National Gov- 
ernment, and shews also, if other proofs were wanting, that 
the unfortunate division of our late Territory could only have 
been effected by a total misrepresentation of the interests and 
wishes of four fifths of our citizens. 

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives : 

The proclamation which convened you at this time was not 
issued without some doubts of its propriety, arising from the 
different constructions which might be given to a clause in the 
act of Congress for extending the right of sufrage in this 
Territory and for other purposes. By the act creating the In- 
diana Territory, the apportionment of the representatives 
amongst the several counties (which was not to exceed nine, 
nor be less than seven) was committed to the Governor. Be-

1. The members of the Council were, Solomon Manwaring, Thomas Downs, Harvy 
Heath, William Prince and Luke Decker ; of the House were Richard Rue and Ephraim 
Overman of Dearborn, James Beggs and John Work of Clark, Moses Hoggatt of 
Harrison, General W. Johnston. John Johnson and John Hadden of Knox. The 
territory had been divided Feb. 8, 1809 ; a new election was held May 22. The election 
was irregular and the legislature was dissolved at its own request Oct. 21, 1809. 



 

fore the act of division took effect the House of Representa- 
tives was composed of seven members, but four of whom by 
the hne of demarcation were left in this Territory. I thought 
it proper, therefore, to issue a proclamation on the 4th of 
April, giving to each of the old counties an additional mem- 
ber, and to the new county of Harrison one also. After the 
proclamation had been signed, but before it had left the office 
of the secretary, I received the first intimation that a law was 
about to be passed by Congress, which amongst other provi- 
sions transferred the apportionment of the Representatives 
from the Governor to the Legislature, and increased the num- 
ber of members necessary to form a house from seven to nine. 
The proclamation being in all respects completed, and con- 
sidering the allowance of additional members in the nature of 
a grant, and the law under which I acted giving me no power 
to abrogate an act of this kind when once done, I did not think 
myself authorized to countermand the elections which had 
been ordered. Nor indeed did there appear to be any neces- 
sity for doing so upon an accurate examination of the law 
itself, which soon after reached me. The fourth section of 
the act does indeed give to the General Assembly the appor- 
tionment of the Representatives, and declares also that there 
shall not be less than nine; but how was this to be done by 
the General Assembly unless they were convened, and how 
could a General Assembly be formed, even under the old law, 
without an increase of the House of Representatives, which by 
the division was reduced to four members? By the old law, 
nine was to be the greatest number allowed to the House of 
Representatives, and seven only had actually been appor- 
tioned. Now, it is impossible to believe that Congress had 
acted under the impression that, after having lopped olT what 
was considered one-third part of the Territory, there would 
I'emain seven members in Indiana. Documents sufficient to 
shew the number of members which would remain were also 
at hand, as the proceedings of the Governor in his executive 
capacity are bi-annually transmitted to the President. From 
all this it appears to have been the intention of Congress that 
a General Assembly should be convened under the old law, 
previously to the organization directed by the new. No other 
construction can be given to the section without rendering it 
altogether a nullity. The power given to the Governor in the 
third section, to apportion the members of the Council, is also 



 

a strong circumstance in favor of this construction. Under 
the authority of the old law he could not organize a House of 
Representatives; but as Congress determined to destroy the 
former Council, and as there could be no General Assembly 
without a Council, it was necessary to invest him with this 
power, or their intentions with regard to the subsequent or- 
ganization of the House of Representatives could not have 
been effected, and the Territory left without a Legislature. 
These are my views of the subject, gentlemen ; but should you 
differ from me in opinion, I would recommend that the laws 
you may pass should not be permitted to go into operation 
until application can be made to Congress to confirm them. 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the 
House of Representatives: 
The division of the Territory has devolved on you the un- 
pleasant task of providing for a considerable defalcation of 
the revenue. But before any additional burthens are laid upon 
your constituents, every possible retrenchment should be made 
in the expenditures of the public money. If your labours to 
this effect should be insufficient to reduce the demands upon 
the Treasury to a level with the receipts, we have no other re- 
source than that of increasing the tax on lands. A fui'ther 
tax upon any species of improvement would be highly im- 
politic, and the odious capitation tax (that appropriate em- 
blem of an aristocratical government) ought on no account to 
be again resorted to. As the wealth of our citizens consists 
almost exclusively of lands, no tax can be more equal and just 
than that which is levied on this species of property. It ought 
indeed, in my opinion, to be the source from which, with some 
trifling exceptions, we should draw the whole of our revenue. 
It is impossible to make the tax upon horses an equal one, be- 
cause the expenses of valuation would nearly absorb the whole 
amount, and reason and justice revolt at the idea of taxing 
the low priced animal, whose labour provides the food for the 
family of the indigent citizen, as high as the pampered steed of 
the man of pleasure, or the costly courser of the sportsman. 
Notwithstanding the present embarrassment of our treasury, 
gentlemen, the prospect before us is far from being discourag- 
ing. The sales of the lands of the United States are daily add- 
ing to the mass from which we derive our revenue ; and a late 
extinguishment of Indian title [See Oct. 1, above] to a large 



 

and fertile body of land has laid the foundation for a great in- 
crease of wealth and population. - 

The organization and discipline of our militia has, for a 
considerable time, engaged my unremitted attention; but the 
progress, altho' considerable, has fallen far short of my wishes 
and that state which promises effectual security to our exposed 
settlements. The law upon this subject is indeed extremely 
deficient ; and although my recommendations for amendments 
have been as urgent and frequent as my respect for the two 
houses would allow, every attempt to procure them has 
hitherto failed. I cannot suppose that those unfounded jeal- 
ousies of the accumulation of power in the hands of the Ex- 
ecutive, which have been propagated amongst the people with 
so much industry and so little success, have ever found ad- 
mittance within these walls. Although not well informed of 
their source, it is not impossible to believe that they have a 
common origin [British] with those unremitted exertions to 
excite our Indian neighbors to hostilities against us. 
That infamous policy which would kindle the fury of 
the blood-thirsty savages, and direct it against an unoffending 
people, would not be too delicate to attempt by any means to 
paralyze the force which would defeat their machinations. It 
is the duty of every republican to keep a watchful eye upon 
those who are entrusted with the reins of government ; but it 
is no less his duty to give to them that confidence and support 
which is so essentially necessary to the prompt discharge of 
their duties. No trouble or expense should be spared to pro- 
cure the removal of a bad officer, but every citizen should be 
prepared to support the constituted authorities of his country 
in every legal exercise of his functions. The Territorial form 
of government possesses some traits which are not altogether 
reconcilable with republican principles, and the commission 
with which I am honored is independent of the people. I am, 
however, so perfectly convinced that their confidence and sup- 
port are essentially necessary to the proper discharge of many 
important duties, as to be unalterably determined that the mo- 
ment which brings a conviction that their confidence has been 
withdrawn shall terminate my commission by a voluntary res- 
ignation. Such is the nature, gentlemen, of military affairs, 
that a great sacrifice of that liberty which is the boast of every

ten-o-elock line running approximately from Brownstown to Montezuma in Parl<e county. 



 

American becomes necessary even in the temporary assump- 
tion of the mihtary habit which our laws require of every able- 
bodied citizen. The powers given to the commander-in-chief, 
and other superior officers, should be commensurate to the 
great object of the militia institutions — that of forming, by 
discipline and frequent trainings, a body of citizen soldiers 
which shall be equal to the defence of our country against 
every invader. By urging this subject upon you, gentlemen, 
I wish it not to be understood that I have the least reason to 
complain of the want of military ardor amongst our citizens. 
The very reverse is the case. Spurning at the base sugges- 
tions of faction or treachery, which would divide them from 
their government, I have ever found the sons of Indiana ready 
to rally 'round their chief, and obey the voice of their coun- 
try, conveyed to them by his orders, at the expense of every 
personal consideration. I could, indeed, relate instances of 
sacrifices in this way which would gladden the heart of every 
patriot. But in a country of laws everything which is sus- 
ceptible of it should be regulated by law, and as little as pos- 
sible left to construction and implication. The codes of the 
several States will furnish you, gentlemen, with well digested 
militia systems. Let these be your guides. Do not subject 
your constituents to more rigid rules than these prescribe. 
But the powers given to the commanders-in-chief in the States 
are necessary to be given here, or I cannot be answerable that 
the discipline of the militia shall be such as the general gov- 
ernment looks for, and our exposed situation requires. 

I have frequently called the attention of your predecessors, 
gentlemen, to the situation of the Court of Chancery. My 
sentiments upon the subject will be found in my communica- 
tion to the last General Assembly.- The recent termination 
[October 4] of a long and fatiguing journey into the Indian 
country [to Fort Wayne] has put it out of my power to notice 
some other matters of importance; they shall form the sub- 
jects of special communications. I am particularly charged 
by the President of the United States to recommend to you the 
passage of a law to prohibit the sale of ardent spirits to the 
Indians. The forcible and affecting language of the late Presi- 
dent Jefferson will best explain to you the wishes of the gov- 
ernment upon this subject. I will cause his letter to be laid 
before you. But it may be proper in me to observe, that the

experience of nine years has left a perfect conviction upon my 
mind that the humane and benevolent intentions of the gov- 
ernment in relation to the aborigines can never be accom- 
plished as long as the means of indulgence in this fatal liquor 
is so easily obtained. By it is our progress arrested at every 
step, whether our exertions are directed to teach them such 
of the arts of civilized life as are adapted to their situation, or 
to introduce amongst them the light of the gospel and human- 
ize their fierce souls by the mild precepts of Christianity. To 
use a figure of one of their orators, it "resembles a mighty 
conflagration, which spreads death and destruction through 
their villages, which none but the power that kindled is able 
to extinguish." It depends in a great measure on you, gentle- 
men, whether the future historian shall exempt republican 
America from the just odium of having contributed her full 
share towards that destruction of the human species, which 
has hitherto marked the settlements of all the civilized nations 
amongst those whom they call savages. Whether the Indian 
villages in our neighborhood shall exhibit to the traveller a 
scene of savage fury, of misery and superstition, or the de- 
lightful spectacle of man in a state of progressive improve- 
ment in morals, the arts of civilized life, and, above all, wor- 
shiping his Creator in the manner which he has himself pre- 
scribed. The State of Ohio, gentlemen, has on this subject 
set you an example of obedience to the national government 
which, I am persuaded, you will not hesitate to follow. 

Permit me to recommend to you, gentlemen, the' cultivation 
of harmony and a spirit of conciliation towards each other. 
Avoid local politicks and local prejudices. Let it be the object 
of all to promote the interest of all. We have all the same 
interests and are, I trust, in pursuit of the same object — that 
of taking upon ourselves as soon as possible the habit of man- 
hood, and assuming our station in the national councils. Per- 
mit me to assure you of my hearty co-operation in any 
measure which may have this tendency, or which may other- 
wise promote the interest and happiness of your constituents.

Special Message: Legality of the General Assembly 

October 19, 1809 

Vincennes Western Swi, December 16, 1809 

Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives 
If there still exists doubts in your minds upon the propriety 
of proceeding to legislate, it will certainly meet my entire ap- 
probation that such a course should be pursued as would 
remove them in the mode the most easy, the most appropriate, 
and the best calculated to secure the rights of your con- 
stituents. 

I think it, however, proper to observe that, as the repre- 
sentative of the United States, I am free to declare that your 
powers to legislate are as complete as they can make them.^ 
William Henry Harrison 

1. The following petition had been presented to Congress November 28, 1809. The 
difficulty was solved by an act of Congress, December 15, 1809 (Statutes at Large, 
Eleventh Congress, Second Session, Ch ii) giving the governor full power to constitute 
a new Assembly after which the power of apportionment should be assumed by it. 
•'Your petitioners state that, in the year 1805, there was a legislature organized under" 
a "law, dividing the territoi-y northwest of the river Ohio; that, on the 26th day of 
October, 1808, the governor dissolved the said legislature. On the 3d of February, 1809, 
the law of congress passed, dividing the Indiana territoi-y ; and that on the 4th day of 
April, 1809, the governor of the territory issued his proclamation for the election of 
the additional members of the house of representatives. Also, on the 27th of February, 
1809, the law passed, extending the right of suffrage to the citizens of Indiana, and 
declaring how the legislature shall be formed after the passage of the said law : that 
is, the General Assembly should apportion the members of the House of Representatives, 
to consist of not less than nine nor more than twelve. This law was evidently 
predicated upon the principle that a legislature was in existence at the time of its 
passage, or that a legislature might be convened under the authority of the governor's 
proclamation : but the fact was different, for the old legislature was doubly dissolved, 
(if this expression may be allowed:) first, by the governor, as above stated: secondly, 
by the division of the territory, which sti-uck off three members of the House of 
Representatives, and two of the Legislative Council. Thus, there was no legislature in 
being to make the apportionment agreeably to the said act of Congress. Now, the 
principal doubt that exists in the minds of your petitioners is, how the 
old legislature (is) to be brought into being, so as to organize the new legislature 
under the act of congress, as above stated. On the first Monday of April, 1809, the 
governor, by his proclamation, directed an election to he held for members of the 
House of Representatives, at which election there were four members elected — to-wit: 
two in the county of Knox : one in the county of Dearborn : and one in the county of 
Clark. On the 4th of April. 1809, (six days before the above law of congress arrived 
here,) the governor issued his writs of election, for an election to be held on the 
22d of May, for five councilors and four more representatives, having himself made 
the apportionment. He gave an additional member to the county of Knox : one to 
the county of Dearborn : one to the county of Clark ; and one to the new county of 
Harrison — making, in the whole, only eight members in the House of Representatives. 
Under these dubious circiunstances, the governor issued his proclamation, convening, 
on the 16th of the present month, the members of the Legislative Council, elected as 
above stated : and the members elected as aforesaid, to serve in the House of Repre- 
sentatives. Agreeably to the aforesaid proclamation, the Legislative Council and the 
members elected to the House of Representatives convened : and the minority of the 



 

Special Message Dissolving Legislature 

October 21, 1809 

Dillon, Indiana, i.37 

I have considered your request for a dissolution of the pres- 
ent Legislature with all the attention the importance of the 
subject demands and the shortness of the time allowed to 
form an opinion would permit. It has ever been my wish to 
assimilate, as far as possible, the government of the Territory 
to those which prevail in the States ; to conceal those rougher 
features of our constitution which are so justly offensive to 
republican delicacy, and which nothing but the infancy of our 
political state renders tolerable. Of this description is the 
power given to the Governor to prorogue and dissolve the Leg- 
islature at pleasure. An application of the people themselves, 
or their representatives, forms one of the few occasions on 
which I would consent to use this power; and, although the 
propriety of the measure at this time is not altogether appar- 
ent to my mind, yet in compliance with your wishes I have 
thought proper to determine, and do now declare, that this 
present Legislature is, from this moment, dissolved, and the 
powers delegated to it by the people again revert to them. 



Resolutions Reappointment of Haerison 

October 28, 1809 

Western Sun, Novembe,r U, 1809 

At a meeting of the officers of the militia for the county of 
Knox, held at Vincennes, in the Indiana territory, on the 28th 
day of October 1809. Colonel [Francis] Vigo was appointed 
president, and captain David Robb, secretary. 

House of Representatives, not conceiving themselves authorized to go on to legis- 
lative business, the legislature agreed to postpone doing any business, in a legislative 
capacity, except apportioning an additional member to make up the number nine, 
agreeably to the said act of congress, extending the right of suffrage to the citizens 
of this territory. From this view of the subject, your petitioners humbly pray, that 
a law may be passed legalizing the above apportionment : so that a legislature may 
be organized under the present law of congress, extending the right of suffrage to 
Indiana, so soon as the governor of this territory may be officially informed of the 
same. Or, if congress doubt of their authority to legalize the above proceedings, upon 
the ground of the laws having an ex post facto operation, then to pass a law authorizing, 
expressly, the governor to organize a legislature upon any plan which, to them, may 
seem proper." Dillon, History of Indiana, 436 seg. 



 

On motion of major [Ephraim] Jordan' — ordered, that a 
committee be appointed to draft a resolution, expressive of the 
confidence this meeting have in the conduct of Governor Har- 
rison, and praying that he may be re-appointed to the govern- 
ment of this territory. Whereupon, major Jordan captains 
[Walter] Wilson,= Purcell,' [Peter] Jones, and [William] 
Bruce,* vi^ere appointed that committee, vs^ho returned after a 
short time, and reported the following which were unani- 
mously concurred in. 

Resolved, That from the exposed situation of the territory, 
surrounded by numerous and warlike tribes of Indians, it is 
of the utmost importance to the safety and prosperity of the 
country, that the governor thereof, who is ex-officio com- 
mander in chief of the militia, should be a man of military 
talents, and information. 

Resolved, That the attention paid to, and the unremitted 
exertions used by William Henry Harrison, to organize and 
discipline, by frequent trainings, the militia of the territory, 
and the masterly skill and great military talents displayed in 
such, his exertions, together with the anxious solicitude with 
which he has ever watched over the peace and happiness of 
the territory, to which may be added, the confidence reposed 
in him, the ease with which he manages their affairs, induced 
this meeting to have the utmost confidence in him, as evi- 
dently qualified to govern the territory, not only because of 
his superior military talents, but also his integrity, patriotism, 
and firm attachment to the general government. 

Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that they 

1. Ephraim Jordan was a member of the Vincennes militia in 1790 to whom the 
government gave 100 acres of land. For many years after 1800 he was a justice of 
the peace. Feb. 3, 1801 he was made justice of the common pleas; July 20, 1802 he 
was appointed a captain; May 5, 1810 he became Lieut. Col.; June 1. 1812 a colonel. 
During the Tippecanoe campaign he sei-ved under Dubois as a scout. 

2. Walter Wilson was appointed a Lieut, in the Knox Co. militia Oct. 3, 1806 ; 
a captain, Sept. 4, 1807. He was also a justice for many years. In June 1811 he 
carried a message from Harrison to the Prophet. He served as a captain in Luke 
Decker's battalion at Tippecanoe. 

3. The Purcell family was among the earliest American settlers in Knox Co. 
Jonathan Purcell. the pioneer, came to Knox Co. from Va. and about 1800 located 
near Bi-uceville. Noah and .\ndrew Purcell were both captains in the Knox county 
militia at this time. Noah was a major at Tippecanoe, Andrew, James, Jonathan and 
William served as privates.

It has indeed occurred to me that the surest means of secur- 
ing good behaviour from this conspicuous personage and his 
brother, would be to make them prisoners, but at this time 
more particularly, it is desirable, that peace with all the Indian 
tribes should be preserved, and I am instructed by the Presi- 
dent to express to your excellency his expectations and confi- 
dence that in all your arrangements, this may be considered 
(as I am confident it ever has been) a primary object with 
you.^ (extract) 

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 3d Novr. 1809 

Har. Pa. 266-273 

Sir: 

I have now the honor to enclose herewith the treaty con- 
cluded at Fort Wayne in the 30th September, [see supra] with 
the Miami, Eel River, Delaware, and Potawatomie Tribes. 
The additional article entered into with the Miamis and Eel 
River tribe on the same day, and the treaty concluded with 
the Weas at this place on the twenty-sixth ultimo, conform- 
ably to the fifth article of the first mentioned treaty. The 
Potawatomies and Delawares were admitted as parties to the 

1. In the month of November the governor received instructions to defer making 
the military establishment up the Wabash which he had proposed in his letter to the 
government Oct. 10. It was expected to accomplish this in the spring. Two companies 
—Captains Posey and Cross— were to winter at Vincenncs. 

Dawson, Harrison, ns 



 

Treaty in conformity with your instructions "that the chiefs 
of all those tribes who have or pretend a right to these lands 
should be present", and the Potawatomies and Delawares 
being present there was no alternative but to make them par- 
ties in some shape or other. Indeed I am convinced that had 
the treaty been made with the Miamis alone the consequences 
to them would have been extremely unpleasant, if not fatal. 
The refusal of the Miamis to acknowledge the right of the 
Delawares to the country watered by the White River, at the 
Treaty of Grouseland, has from that time continued to rankle 
in the minds of the latter and to produce a disposition which 
bordered on actual hostility. The poverty and wretchedness 
of the Potawatomies made them extremely desirous of a treaty 
at which they expected to have their most pressing wants re- 
lieved. To have excluded either would have been extremely 
unpolitic on our part, as it would have entirely alienated the 
minds of those Tribes from us — nor do I believe that the 
Miamis would have dared to conclude the Treaty without them 
— as it is the arrangement which has been made is just to all 
and is therefore I believe, satisfactory to all. The Delawares, 
besides a considerable addition to their annuity, have had their 
equal right with the Miamis to the lands on White river con- 
firmed. The Potawatomies have been gratified with consid- 
erable present in goods which they much wanted, and a fur- 
ther addition to their annuity. This will create another 
tie to bind this numerous and warlike Tribe to the United 
States. They were not however as perfectly satisfied with the 
Miamis when they left Fort Wayne as could have been wished 
— there wei'e so great a number present that the goods, when 
divided amongst them, were found greatly below their neces- 
sities, and indeed some of them went off without a single 
article. Every opportunity which the shortness of my stay, 
after the signing of the Treaty, would allow, was employed to 
convince them of the justice and generosity with which they 
had been treated. If any ill blood yet remains, a little atten- 
tion to the influential cheifs will soon remove it. The Treaty 
as it now stands is nearly what the Miamis wished — the other 
Tribes have been admitted to it only as their allies, and their 
title to the lands on the Wabash left in statu quo. Their 
argument to the article in favour of the Delaware claim to the 
lands on White River was prompt candid and unequivocal. 
This arrangement will facilitate the acquirement of this valu- 



 

able "country by the United States, as the Delawares have had 
for a long time a desire to remove to the west of the Missis- 
sipi. The compensation given for this cession of lands, altho' 
somewhat higher than what has been heretofore given in any 
Treaty I have made with the Indians, is as low as it could pos- 
sibly be made. Great pains have been taken by the British 
Indian Department of Upper Canada by their agents in this 
country and by some of our owai citizens to dissuade them 
from selling any more of their land or to demand a price for 
it which they know would not be given. The manner in which 
the United States sell their lands has been particularly ex- 
plained to them; and hence their demand to have what they 
should sell, surveyed on their account, and two dollars per 
acre allowed for it. There tenaciousness in adhering to this 
idea was astonishing, and it required no little pains to get 
them to abandon it. 

I think however upon the whole that the bargain is a bet- 
ter one for the United States than any that has been made by 
me for lands south of the Wabash. The Tract along the Boun- 
dary line south from Fort Recovery, is almost altogether of 
the very first rate. The County of Dearborn in this territory 
adjoining it is settled up to the very line; and the farms are 
thicker than in any part of the western country that I have 
seen, the neighbourhood of Lexington excepted. I am in- 
formed by the Register of the Land Office at Cincinnati and 
other respectable persons that it is their opinion, that there 
will be several hundred families upon this Tract as soon as 
the Treaty is ratified and an office opened for the sale of it. 
The Tract adjoining on the Vincennes Tract is not so uni- 
formly good, but it contains much more good land than either 
the Tract ceded by the Treaty of Grouseland or that of Vin- 
cennes with the Delawares and Piankeshaws. 

I sounded the Chiefs on the subject of taking a sum in 
gross or by instalments in lieu of annuities as compensation 
for the land ceded; but I soon found that there was no possi- 
bility of succeeding. It is indeed the nature of savages to 
provide for the wants of today at every sacrifice of future 
prospects, to cut down the tree to obtain the fruit, and to de- 
stroy the teeming animal for a present meal whose progeny 
would increase their riches and add to their enjoyments. But 
our Indians have taken one decisive step towards civilization, 
they begin to look to futurity; and to those comfortable re- 



 

freshments which they yearly receive in the shape of annuities 
has taught them to set a proper vakie on this kind of payment. 
Our Government too have greatly contributed to their acquire- 
ment of this knowledge and Mr. Jefferson has personally told 
them that he considered it the duty of the U. States to pur- 
chase their lands in this manner, when they wished to sell 
even if they (the U. States) had no immediate use for them. 
I am fully persuaded that no sum in hand would have induced 
the Miamis and Delawares to part from their lands. The 
Potawatomies are not so far advanced in putting off the sav- 
age notions, and it is probable that they. could be induced to 
give up their permanent annuity for a larger one for a term 
of years; but then, a proposition of this kind would contradict 
the principles which we have been for years endeavouring to 
teach them. 

I expect the Kickapoo Chiefs here about the tenth Inst. They 
are very much under the influence of the Prophet, and it is 
possible that they may refuse to give up their claim to the 
lands northwest of the Wabash, but I will pledge myself to 
obtain it in the course of eight or ten months, as the Miamis 
who are the real owners of the land have surrendered their 
claim, we can wait a favourable opportunity to obtain the re- 
liquishment of their (the Kickpaoo) title derived only from 
present occupancy. 

I have employed a gentleman to make a sketch of the two 
Tracts lately purchased, from the best information we can 
obtain, which will be transmitted herewith if it is finished in 
time, if not it will be sent on by the succeeding mail. 

A mischievous story had been circulated amongst the In- 
dians at Fort Wayne, that the President did not want the 
lands I proposed to purchase, and that I wished to procure 
them for my own use and that of the people of Vincennes. To 
obviate this I told them that I should have no objection to per- 
mit some of their chiefs to go on to the seat of Government 
this fall, and that they would hear from the President's own 
lips the pleasure he derived from their compliance with his 
wishes respecting the late cession of lands. When I came 
from Fort Wayne they had not determined whether they would 
go or not. Knowing the inconvenience of expense to which 
these visits subject the Government I endeavoured to get them 
to relinquish the idea. I have lately however received a mes- 
senger from the Delawares requesting that three of their 



 

Chiefs may be allowed to go on to take their new father by 
the hand. I could not refuse their request without violating 
my promise ; but have consented to it only upon condition that 
the Miami and Potawatomi chiefs are also willing to go on 
at this time. The former told me that they could not make 
it convenient to go this winter ; and I have also instructed Mr. 
[John] Conner and Mr. Shaw' to endeavour to dissuade them 
from going, so that I believe there is little danger of your 
being plagued with them this winter. But lest they should, 
contrary to my expectations and wishes, insist on going on, I 
have appointed Mr. John Conner, the Delaware interpreter to 
accompany them, and have this day drawn upon you in favour 
of Mr. Shaw, the Assistant Indian Agent at Fort Wayne for 
$1000 in ten separate drafts to provide horses and bear the 
expenses of the journey to Washington. If this trip should 
be abandoned I have directed the drafts to be returned to me. 
With great respect and consideration I have the honor to be

Reappointment of Harrison 

November 4, 1809 

Western Sun, November 4, 1809 

The following resolution has been sent on the general gov- 
ernment by our legislature, on the subject of Governor HAR- 
RISON'S reappointment. It passed the house of representa- 
tives unanimously, and the council, three to one. 

Whereas, from the collision of laws, and other circum- 
stances, doubts are entertained by the minority of the legis- 
lature on the constitutionality of its organization, and the 
majority from a spirit of conciliation, having thought it most 
prudent, not to proceed to any other act of legislation than 
the apportionment of their members under the last act of 
congress — but from a knowledge of the wishes of their con- 
stituents by petitions, as well as from other sources of infor- 
mation, and from a wish to express their own sentiments on 
the crisis in their government, which is now approaching, 
viz: the appointment of governor of our territory, whilst they 

1. Shaw was sub-Indian agent at Fort Wayne and in special charge of the Pottawat- 
tomies. He seems to have acted as a scout for Harrison at least from 1809 to 1812. 



 

are anxious to avoid the appearance of inconsistency, by do- 
ing any act which might bear the shadow of a legislative act, 
they cannot forbear from recommending to, and requesting 
of the President and senate, most earnestly, in their names 
and in the names of their constituents, the re-appointment of 
their present Governor, William Henry Harrison; 

because, they are sensible he possesses the good vdshes and 
affection of a great majority of his fellow citizens ; 

because they believe him sincerely attached to the union, 
the prosperity of the United States, and the administration 
of its government; 

because they believe him in a superior degree capable of 
promoting the interest of our territory, from long experi- 
ence, and laborious attention to our general concerns — from 
his influence over the Indians, and his wise and disinterested 
management of that department — and 

because they have confidence in his virtues, talents, and 
republicanism. Therefore, they earnestly request the con- 
currence of the members of the council to this recommenda- 
tion. 

Resolved, That three copies of the above recommendation 
be made out by the clerk, which shall be signed by the speaker 
of this house, and by the president of the legislative council, 
one whereof, shall be by the speaker, forwarded to the Presi- 
dent of the United States, another to the president of the 
senate of the United States, and the other to our delegate in 
gress. General W. Johnston

Journal kept by Captain [Peter] Jones the Secretary. There 
appears to be much more land in these tracts than I expected 
being upwards of 2,900,000 acres. I believe there are two or 
three excellent salt springs on the tract near this. General 
William Clarke' who is now at Washington can give you 
some information on this subject. The one marked in the 
sketch has been visited since the Treaty by some of our citi- 
zens who say that it promises well. [See Oct. 1, above] 

The sketch is principally intended to show the advantages 
which would arise from opening a Road to Dayton in the 
State of Ohio. It would bring us 120 miles nearer the seat 
of Government. I believe that the Indians would consent to 
have the road opened through that part of their country 
which it must necessarily pass through.

Sir: 

I did myself the honor to write to you from Fort Wayne 
in favour of William Wells the late Indian Agent at that 
place and upon reflection' I have thought it proper to give 
you a concise history of his past and present conduct, that 
his merits and demerits may be fairly before you. Wells 
sei-ved in the army of General Wayne as a Captain of Spies 
or Scouts and in that capacity he rendered the most impor- 
tant services. His activity, enterprise and bravery were mani- 
fested throughout the campaign, and his knowledge of the 
country, of the Indian habits and mode of warfare were in- 
dispensable to the success of our operations. After the Treaty 
of Greenville he was retained as an Interpreter and in a year 
or two promoted to the post of Indian Agent. In this situ- 

1. William Clark was commissioned a captain of the militia at Clarksville Ind. 
Jan. 8, 1790 by Winthrop Sargent. He was a lieutenant under Wayne and intimately 
acquainted with Harrison. He had doubtless hunted over a large part of the land of 
this purchase. He was a brother of George R. Clark and the companion of Colonel 
Lewis on the trip to the Pacific.

ation also his sei-vices were highly useful uniting to his knowl- 
edge of the Indian languages and character great zeal and 
industry in the discharge of his duties. With them, however, 
were unfortunately blended a disposition for intrigue and for 
the accumulation of property which perhaps was not always 
under the government of the most rigid rules of justice. In 
the year 1805 in conjunction of the Little Turtle he con- 
cluded an intrigue against me which was discovei-ed and ex- 
posed by General Dearborn and his dismission would have 
been the consequence if I had not solicited his pardon. This 
I did from a belief that his promises of future good conduct 
would be observed and from a persuasion also that the quali- 
fications he possessed for the appointment of Indian Agent 
could not be found in any other Individual. I have had no 
reason to complain of him from that time. But I have 
heard that the late Secy, of War [Henry Dearborn] became 
convinced that his expenditure of the public money was not 
always made for the public benefit and that this was the 
cause of his dismission. I was not however officially in- 
formed of this, nor was I consulted on the subject of his 
dismission. I received the first intimation of it from Wells 
himself who solicited my interferance in his behalf and ten- 
dered me his aid in accomplishing the treaty which was con- 
templated. This was accepted because I knew that if he was 
not employed both himself and the Turtle would do every- 
thing in their power to defeat it. As it was, they both ex- 
erted themselves in favour of the treaty, but their subsequent 
conduct has been so highly improper as to do away with all 
the favourable impressions which their zeal for the Treaty 
had created. I refer you to Mr. [John] Johnston for par- 
ticulars. It remains to be considered whether it would be 
proper to employ Wells again in any situation and I really 
know not what to advise. He is certainly capable of ren- 
dering veiy important service and if he is not employed and 
remains where he is every measure of the Government will 
be opposed and thwarted by himself and the Turtle. As it 
is their influence is very limitted, but they possess such tal- 
ents for intrigue and are so well acquainted with the Indian 
character as to be able to do a great deal of mischief by 
working on the suspicious prejudices and superstitious dis- 
position of those even who dislike them most. A subordinate 
situation where he would not have the disposal of money is 



 

the only one for which I would recommend him. There is no 
danger of his refusing the appointment even of an interpreter. 
Whilst I am on this subject permit me to call your attention 
to the situation of Mr. [Joseph] Barron' my Interpreter at 
this place. He is the only one I have ever had here as he 
speaks the languages of all the Tribes residing within this 
territory, a qualification that is possessed by no other indi- 
vidual that I know of. He is besides the only interpreter I 
ever knew who was solely devoted to the interests of the 
United. States, to the exclusion of every sympathy for the 
Indians which would interfere with his duty. Nine tenths of 
them preferring the interests of the Indians to that of their 
employers. His compensation was fixed by me when I first 
came to the Territory and is no higher than what is allowed 
to the most ignorant and useless of his class. I think his 
long and faithful services merit some attention from the Gov- 
ernment and I should be much gratified to be allowed to 
raise his pay from 30 to 40 dollars per month. This can be 
done with more propriety at present as I shall dismiss Mr. 
[Michael] Brouillett on his arrival here unless there should 
appear to be a greater necessity for his continuance than I 
at present apprehend. 

I have the honor to be with the most perfect respect Sir 
Your Humble Servt.

Your Excellency's letters of the 29th Augt. and of the 3d

received. The explanations relative to the Treaties, are satis- 

1. Joseph Barron was the most trusted scout Harrison ever employed. His name is 
attached to evei-y treaty of importance negotiated by Harrison. In the delicate affair 
with the prophet Barron was always in evidence. He accompanied Harrison to Tippe- 
canoe and, all told, spent 18 years in the service. He was a native of Detroit but 
spent nearly all his life on the Wabash, where he died, in Lo.^ansport, at the home of 
his son, July 31, 1843. The painter Geo, Winter, painted his portrait. The Indians

Sir: 

The Kickapoo Chiefs having arrived at this place a few days 
ago and the late Treaty at fort Wayne having been carefully 
explained to them their consent has been obtained to the ces- 
sion north west of the Wabash and also a further extinguish- 
ment of Title as high up as the Vermilion River. I was 
extremely anxious that the cession should have been extended 
to the river by the Treaty of Fort Wayne, but it was objected 
to because it would include a Kickapoo Village. This small 
tract (of about 20 miles square) is one of the most beautiful 
that can be conceived, is moreover believed to contain a very 
rich copper mine. I have myself frequently seen specimens 
of the copper one of which I sent to Mr. Jefferson in 1802. 
The Indians were extremely jealous of any search being made 
for this mine that the Traders were always cautioned not to 
approach the hills which are supposed to contain the mine. I 
observe that copper mines are not reserved by the law of Con- 
gress regulating the sales of the land of the United States but 
it ought to be done at this cession if it is supposed to be an 
object worth attending to. As I know that there are indi- 
viduals who have turned their attention towards this mine 
and will probably prevail upon the Indians to show them the 
mine and for a large reward conceal it from the knowledge of 
the Government or those whom they might employ to search for 
it. The Treaty [Dec. 9, 1809] is herewith inclosed and I hope 
it will prove satisfactory. I shall immediately dispatch a 
speech to the Miamies to communicate the new cession to them. 
I am greatly obliged by the payment of my draft of the 18th 
February last in favour of George Wallace Jur. for $189.55. 
I have this day drawn upon in favour of Peter Jones and Com- 
pany for fifty dollars on account of my last services in 
negotiating the late Treaties but I shall take care to leave a 
sufficiency due me on that account to cover the aforesaid ad- 



 

vance of $189.55. But in the mean time I must beg you to 
defer your final decision against that article of the General 
account rendered last Winter which charged for furnishing 
a room for Conference Treaty and with the Indians. As I 
am persuaded I have it in my power to convince you of the 
reasonableness and justice of the charge.

A Treaty bettveen the United States of America and the Kicka- 
poo tribe of Indians. 

William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana territory, 
and commissioner plenipotentiary of the United States for 
treating with the Indian tribes northwest of the Ohio, and the 
sachems and war chiefs of the Kickapoo tribe, on the part of 
the said tribe, have agreed to the following articles, which, 
when ratified by the President, by and with the advice of the 
Senate, shall be binding on said parties. 

Article 1. The ninth article of the treaty concluded at fort 
Wayne, on the thirtieth of September last, and the cession it 
contains, is, hereby, agreed to by the Kickapoos, and a perma- 
nent additional annuity of four hundred dollars, and goods to 
the amount of eight hundred dollars, now delivered, is to be 
considered as a full compensation for the said cession. 

Art. 2. The said tribe further agrees to cede to the United 
States, all that tract of land which lies between the tract above 
ceded, the Wabash, the Vermillion river, and a line to be drawn 
from the north corner of the said ceded tract, so as to strike 
the Vermillion river at the distance of twenty miles, in a di- 
rect line from its mouth. For this cession, a further annuity 
of one hundred dollars, and the sum of seven hundred dollars, 
in goods, now delivered, is considered as a full compensation. 
But, if the Miamies should not be willing to sanction the latter 
cession, and the United States should not think proper to take 
possession of the land without their consent, they shall be 
released from the obligation to pay the additional annuity of 
one hundred dollars. 



 

Art. 3. The stipulations contained in the treaty of Green- 
ville, relatively to the manner of paying the annuity, and of 
the right of the Indians to hunt upon the land, shall apply 
to the annuity granted and the land ceded by the present 
treaty. 

In testimony whereof, the said WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON 
and the sachems and head-war chiefs of the said tribe, have 
hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals, this ninth day 
of December, one thousand eight hundred and nine.

I am sorry to inform you, that there being no appropria-

Draft on me for 17 dollars could be regularly paid, it was, 
on being recently presented necessarily protested. As some 
of the Governors of other Territories have fallen into the like 
errors, and their drafts have met the same fate, it is proper 
that I should inform you, in order to prevent similar occur- 
rences, that the appropriation which is annually made for the 
contingent expenses of that and all other Territories, being 
alone applicable to such expences no allowance therefor can 
be made from any appropriation committed to this Depart-

Sm: 

A circumstance occurred here some time since, which has 
been the occasion of great alarm to the Wea Tribe. For some 
years past a band of the Muscoe Tribe of Creeks have resided 



 

in this Territory, generally in the neighbourhood of the Ohio 
and Mississippi. Their numbers have fluctuated from 20 to 
40 or 50. These fellows have occasionally greatly annoyed 
the white settlers and have formed the subject of several com- 
munications to the late Secretary. ^ About Christmass last a 
party of them being in this town to trade, two of them were 
killed in a drunken frolic, by two young men of the Wea Tribe. 
The rest went off" vowing vengeance against the Weas. The 
latter were so much frightened that they employed my inter- 
ference. I accordingly brought about a meeting between the 
head men on each side and procured a suspension of hostilities 
until a general meeting shall take place in the spring. In the 
mean time the Weas have requested me to advance to the 
Muscoes fifty dollars to be charged to their annuity for this 
year, as an earnest of their disposition to cover up the blood 
which has been spilt. 

Which I have accordingly done and have this day drawn 
on you for that amount in favor of George Wallace, Jun. I 
have the honor be with great respect Sir, 
Your Humble Servt.

powered to apportion the members to the House of 
Representatives of the said Territory, and to cause an election 
to be held for the same — also to cause an election for members 
of the Legislative Council, in case of vacancy; And whereas, 
the late Legislature of the Territory was at the request of the 
two houses dissolved by the Governor on the 21st day of Oc- 

1. April 29. 1811 the governor called a special session ol the territorial court to 
try Lawrent Bazadone for killing a Muscoe Indian.

Legislative Council, agreeably to the apportionment made by 
my proclamation of the 4th of April last, viz : one from each 
of the counties of Dearborn, Clark, and Harrison, and one 
from each of the districts of the county of Knox. And the 
sheriffs of the said counties respectively are hereby directed 
to cause the said election to be held on the said second day of

Harrison to Scott 

March 10, 1810 

Western Stin, Augiist 11, 1810 

Thoughts on the subject of the Discipline of the Militia of 
the United States in a letter from Governor Harrison of 
the Indiana Territory, to Governor Scott of Kentucky. 
Dear Sm : Since it appears probable that our government 
will not be able much longer to pursue that system of for- 
bearance and accomodation towards the belligerents of Eu- 
rope from which it has derived so much honor, and the peo- 
ple so much prosperity, it is not surprising that more than 
common solicitude should be manifested to effect a more per- 
fect organization and discipline of the militia. I have ac- 
cordingly obsem-ed that in all the communications which 
have been lately made by the executives of the States and 



 

Territories to their respective Legislatures, the subject has 
been pi'essed with more than usual earnestness. 

The manner in which you noticed it in your address to the 
General Assembly of Kentucky particularly engaged my at- 
tention ; because I always calculated that the weight of your 
character and influence, added to the authority of chief magis- 
trate, would do much towards the removal of those errors 
which unfortunately pervade all our militia systems ; and that 
under your auspices and guidance the hardy sons of Ken- 
tucky would afi'ord an example of military discipline (as they 
frequently have of military ardour) which would produce the 
most beneficial eff'ects to our country. I knew, indeed, that 
ig-norance, obstinacy, and deep-rooted prejudice were to be 
overcome; but I flattered myself that your fellow citizens 
would listen to the advice of an old and faithful friend, whose 
military experience had been gained in many a bloody field, 
and whose patriotism and disinterestedness had been mani- 
fested through a long life devoted to their service. In the 
list of acts passed at the last session of your Legislature, I 
obsei-ve one "to amend the militia laws." I am not informed 
in what these amendments consist, but to answer any valu- 
able purpose they must be such as to leave few features of 
your former system. 

I have never seen any of the militia laws of the eastern 
States. But those of the Southern, Middle, and Western 
states, so nearly resemble each other that the objections I 
shall make will apply equally to all. And that these are rad- 
ically defective, one melancholy fact sufficiently demonstrates. 
With the exception of the large to-\\ms (where there are volun- 
tary military associations entirely independent of the militia 
laws), is there a single brigade from the St. Marys to the 
Hudson, and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, so well 
disciplined as to perform the commonest evolutions which the 
laws direct them to be taught, with sufficient precision to 
satisfy a military man ? If such a one there is, it has escaped 
my observations and enquiry. And what, my dear sir, is the 
fact with regard to our own section of the Union ? Our able- 
bodied men have been enrolled and formed into companies, 
battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions, and the proper 
number and grades of officers appointed to command them. 
But after making allowance for the great increase of num- 
bers, do they form a better defence for the country than they 



 

possessed fifteen or twenty years ago, when there was scarcely 
any organization at all? From a knowledge of the ardent 
patriotism which pervades the Western country, I am per- 
suaded that an army of volunteers might be raised whenever 
the government may call for one; but would it be composed 
of men better disciplined, or better calculated for immediate 
service, than those who composed the various expeditions un- 
dertaken in the course of the Indian war, when no attempt 
to train them to regular discipline had been made? No one 
who is in the least acquainted with what the militia were, 
and what they are now, can answer this question affirmatively. 
It follows, then, that our militia laws have been of no use, 
and that the time that has been spent by our citizens in at- 
tending the days of muster is just so much lost to themselves 
and the community, — or rather worse than lost, for it is too 
well knowm that they are generally devoted to riot and in- 
temperance. I have never met with a single individual who 
would affirm that he derived any benefit from attending the 
militia musters. The industrious man and the good citizen 
attend them because the laws direct him to do so, and to save 
his fine; but he makes his escape as soon as possible, with 
the conviction that he has lost a day which might have been 
usefully employed at home, without having benefitted his 
country. It is the lazy and intemperate alone who rejoice at 
the approach of a muster day, because it affords an oppor- 
tunity of gratifying their vicious propensities. These obser- 
vations apply more particularly to the company musters, 
where I believe, in nineteen out of twenty instances, little 
else is done that relates to military duty than barely calling 
the rolls. At the battalion and regimental musters there are 
generally, indeed, some awkard attempts made to perform the 
manual exercise, and some few of the evolutions, directed by 
the Baron de Steuben. In the few instances v/here these 
happen to be commanded by old Revolutionary officers, or 
others who have in some degree attended to their duty, the 
progress that they might make in discipline is entirely pre- 
vented by the great length of time which intervenes between 
the days of training. Our laws generally prescribe a battalion 
muster in the spring and one of the regiments in the fall. It 
rarely happens that more than one of these takes place. But 
in the few instances where more punctuality is observed, and 
where the commanding officer is capable and really attempts 



 

to instruct his men, it must be evident that the lesson given 
in the spring will be totally obliterated by the fall, and of 
that which is given in the latter season not a trace will re- 
main at the expiration of the seven months which brings 
about the vernal meeting. How it could be supposed that 
the science of war could be learnt in this manner is most 
surprising. 

And yet, bad as it is, this is the best side of the picture. 
For it is very certain that, throughout the Western country, 
of those who command the various militia corps, and on whom 
the task of instruction is devolved, there are very few who 
are better informed than the men whom they attempt to teach. 
Our legislatures appear to be well apprised of the importance 
of a well disciplined militia — the preamble to many of the 
laws express this conviction. But they seem to have sup- 
posed that nothing [more] was necessary to effect their 
wishes than to cause the men to be enrolled and fomied into 
companies, regiments, etc., and occasionally to meet together. 
They did not recollect that, to make men soldiers instructors 
were necessary; and that to procure these, sufficient encour- 
agement should be offered to induce persons to qualify them- 
selves for the task. This is not so easily attained as is gen- 
erally supposed. To form a complete disciplinarian upon the 
system of modern tactics, requires as much preparation and 
as much knowledge and science, as for either of those pro- 
fessions to which the appellation of "learned" has been gen- 
erally applied. Nor is the skill necessary for manoeuvring 
a regiment or brigade to be acquired without considerable 
attention and practical instruction ; it is impossible to acquire 
it by reading alone. A man may, indeed, make himself ac- 
quainted with the manner of performing certain manoeuvres 
in this way; but the grace, the harmony, and precision of 
movement, which is so necessary in all military evolutions, 
can only be acquired by practice. 

If our legislatures are really desirous to have the militia 
so well disciplined as to form an effectual defence to our coun- 
try against every invader, if they wish to bring it to that 
state of perfection as entirely to supersede the necessity of 
a standing ai-my, the system heretofore in use must be en- 
tirely changed. Instead of the few days now appropriated 
to the purposes of training, and the very few hours of those 
days actually employed, some weeks at least must be devoted 



 

to the purpose, and the men must be taught in camps of dis- 
cipline those duties which, representing a faithful image of 
actual war, forms the best school in which it can be taught. 
For the accomplishment of an object so desirable and neces- 
sary, no pains or expense should be spared. Able officers 
should be sought after and employed, and every stimulus 
should be used to engage our youth to enter with ardor on a 
course of discipline which is to qualify them to defend their 
country. Occasional military orations should teach them the 
necessity of subordination and obedience, and by placing be- 
fore them the illustrious examples of military virtue with 
which the history of the Grecian and Roman republics abound, 
impress on their minds that the temporary sacrifice of per- 
sonal liberty which the military life imposes have been cheer- 
fully submitted to by the purest patriots and the most zealous 
republicans. At the frequent reviews which should take 
place, particularly that by the commander-in-chief, every- 
thing that is facinating in military array — the "whole pomp 
of war" — should be introduced, to keep up the ardor of the 
youth, and excite the emulation of the several corps; nor 
aught rewards and distinctions to be withheld from those 
which excel, the latter to be such only as accords with re- 
publican institutions, and however trifling might be the in- 
trinsic value of the former, opinion would soon render them 
as precious to the receiver, as the oak or laurel crowns which 
were formerly the reward of successful skill or valor. By 
steady pursuit of this plan for a few years, our militia would 
become formidable to any European army which should land 
on our shores; for it is very certain that it is discipline alone, 
or the facility of performing evolutions with rapidity and pre- 
cision, which makes one body of troops superior to another. 

Of this, innumerable instances might be adduced, from 
modern as well as ancient history. The Thebans were in- 
debted for their victories over the (till then) unconquered 
Spartans, as much to some new manoeuvres which had been 
introduced into their tactics, and which they had practiced 
with unwearied assiduity, as to the great abilities of their 
generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas. That unexpected and 
rapid movement which decided the battle of Leuctra 
could never have been executed in the face of such an enemy, 
if it had not been familiar to them from long previous prac- 
tice. And at that of Mantinea, although their operations 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 405 

were directed by a perfect master of the art of war, who 
did everything that depended on him by putting the left wing 
of the enemy composed of Athenians in the air, and bring- 
ing his Thebans to act hand to hand with the Spartans, the 
event must still have depended upon superior valor or su- 
perior discipline. Valor was nowhere more predominant 
than in the Spartan infantry, and their evolutions were as 
well understood by the soldiers as the general. But the su- 
perior compactness of the military wedge, composed of the 
proverbially stupid Boeotians, the scorn of Greece, which prac- 
tice had enabled them to preserve, triumphed over the de- 
scendants of Leonidas and the pupils of Agesilaus. The 
troops with which the great Frederick commenced the Silesian 
war had never heard the report of a hostile gun, but in the 
battles of Mollwitz, of Prague, of Rossbach and Leuthen, 
they practiced those lessons which they had been taught in 
the peaceful fields of Berlin and Potsdam. When he was pre- 
paring for his first campaign, the Austrian minister wished 
to dissuade him from the enterprise, by inspiring with fears 
for a contest where his parade battalions would have to en- 
counter the veteran troops of his mistress, whose valor and 
discipline had been proved in fields of actual danger. "Your 
majesty's troops are very fine," said he, "but you must recol- 
lect that ours have seen the wolf." "You think my troops 
are fine," said Frederick; "1 will convince you that they are 
good." The succeeding battle of Mollwitz shewed that troops 
that can manoeuvre well, though they may never have seen 
an enemy, are able to cope with veterans, and to conquer in 
spite of the blunder of their generals: the king had com- 
mitted a mistake in his dispositions, which could not have 
been rectified by marshal Schwerin if the discipline of the 
troops had not been perfect. 

I have recommended camps of discipline to instruct those 
who are already capable of bearing arms; but the career of 
military instruction for our youth should commence as soon 
as their mental and bodily powers have acquired sufficient 
strength. Professorships of tactics should be established in 
all our seminaries, and even the amusements of the children 
should resemble those of the ancient gj'mnasia, that they may 
grow up in the practice of those exercises which will enable 
them to bear with ease the duty of the camp and labors of 
the field. 



 

It will no doubt be urged as a reason for continuing the 
old plan that the poorer class of our citizens cannot spare 
five or six weeks in a year from their farms to leam mili- 
tary duty. I know that they cannot, without being paid ; but 
is not our government able to pay them? If it is not, they 
ought to make themselves so by laying additional taxes. But 
I am persuaded that the money that is devoted to other ob- 
jects may be more usefully, and certainly more consistently, 
appropriated to this purpose. Under our present circum- 
stances the 6,000 regular troops we have are very proper; 
but I think that 100,000 disciplined militia would be better, 
and that the money which is spent on the former would soon 
effect the discipline of the latter. 

I am far from thinking a fleet unnecessary, and there is 
no man who attaches more importance to the improvement 
of our country by canals and roads. I do not think, however, 
that these should be the first objects on which our i^evenue 
should be expended; and I recollect that every man in Rome 
was a soldier before they had a fleet or an Appian or Fla- 
minian way. The defence of every despotic government is 
a standing army. Despots, therefore, very properly make it 
the first object of their care and expense. The safety of a 
republic entirely depends on the discipline of its militia, and 
we very inconsistently make it the last object of our atten- 
tion. The general government have lately turned their 
thoughts to the militia, and have resolved to arm the whole 
of them. You, my dear sir, need not be told that a system 
of instruction should be commenced as soon as the arms are 
delivered; and that even with this system, the arms should 
only be occasionally put into the hands of the men, until 
they had learnt to value them and to take care of them. Un- 
less this precaution is used, the millions of dollars which the 
arms will cost had much better be expended upon the gun- 
boats, on which the eloquent author [John Randolph] of the 
attempt to "arm the whole of the militia" has lavished so 
much bitter invective and sarcasm. It would certainly be 
better to apply the money that is intended to "arm the whole" 
to discipline and arm a part of the militia. And it ought to 
have occured to Mr. Randolph, than whom no man is better 
acquainted with history, that Carthage possessed arms as 
well as Rome, but not, like the latter, a disciplined militia. 
Rome therefore survived the slaughter of Trebia, of Thres- 



 

samene, and Cannae, whilst the fate of Carthage was deter- 
mined by the single defeat of Zama. The loss of men com- 
pared with her population was nothing, men in abundance 
were left, but no soldiers. Let her militia be disciplined, and 
the independence of America would be presei-ved against a 
world united. The loss of her capital, and a succession of 
defeats, might distress but would not ruin her. As long as 
she had men enough to form an army, liberty would have 
a temple. Li Greece (as long as Greece was free) every man 
was a soldier. Hence it happened that those small republics 
could be conquered only by extirpation. In the disastrous 
Sicilian expedition, a third of the citizens of Athens per- 
ished; and yet she survived to reap new laurels, whilst the 
proud empire of Carthage was humbled in the dust by a 
single defeat. The immortal victories of Marathon. Salamis, 
and Platea were achieved by a disciplined militia; and the 
Roman legions which conquered the world were nothing more. 
Amongst these hardy republicans, nothing would be thought 
more disgraceful than to be igniorant of the tactics then in 
practice, or to be unable to manage with dexterity the sword, 
the spear, and the shield. Our youth practice with no other 
arms but the pistol, and learn no other warfare but such as 
is to serve them in a contest with their fellow citizens. With 
these principles, and this sort of education, they will possess 
only the courage of ostentation, and will brave death in what 
is called the field of honor, "but fly at the sight of the enemy". 

Being called to a distant part of the Territory, I must con- 
clude this long letter \vithout having finished all the observa- 
tions which I intended to make. The subject shall be resumed 
on my return, and the particular motive communicated which 
induced me to address myself particularly to you. 

I have the honor to be, dear sir, 

Your friend and humble servant, 

William Henry Harrison 
His Excellency, Charles Scott, Governor of Kentucky 

Harrison to Scott 

Vincennes, 17th April, 1810 

Dear Sir: Western Sun, August 18, ISIO 

Circumstances of a domestic nature have prevented my 
completeing until now the observations on the discipline of 



408 INDIANA HISTOPwICAL COLLECTIONS 

the militia of the United States, which I promised in my let- 
ter of March 10. There is no political axiom more generally 
diffused amongst the people of the United States than that 
which declares militia to be the only proper defence of a re- 
public. Standing armies are universally reprobated ; and yet, 
with this just view of the kind of force which they aught to 
cherish, and that which they aught to avoid, it is astonishing 
that they should so neglect the former as to make the em- 
ployment of the latter a matter of absolute necessity upon 
every appearance of danger. We have, indeed, no militia. 
That term is properly applied only to citizens who are dis- 
ciplined, or trained for war. The placing a man's name on 
a muster-roll, or including him in a return, will no more con- 
stitute him a militia man than the enregistering his name 
on a list of attorneys or physicians would authorize him to 
assume either of those appellations without the previous 
study and preparation by which a knowledge of law and 
physic is only to be acquired. It is to this mistake of the 
materials to form a force for that force itself which is, I 
apprehend, the cause of our supineness and confidence. We 
look at the returns from the Department of War, and find 
that 680,000 men are enrolled ; but we forget that not a fiftieth 
part of them are soldiers. We might, with nearly the same 
propriety, exult in our ability to cope with the fleet of Britain 
upon the ocean because we possess the materials for forming 
one equal to hers, as to rest our defence upon an army which 
possessed no other claims to the appellation than what it 
would derive from the law which called it into service. 

Another cause of the neglect of discipline is, our great dis- 
tance from any formidable power and the peculiar circum- 
stances of the two great rival potentates of Europe — the one 
commanding the ocean, but with a land force scarcely equal 
to the defence of their own territories; and the other pos- 
sessing an immense anny, without a fleet. Our security is 
supposed to lie in the inability of either to attack us, and 
the rivalship and national hatred which exists between them 
preventing a coalition for that purpose. If there were not 
so many instances of despots suspending their rage against 
each other and uniting their efforts whenever by such union 
an extension of their dominions could be accomplished, I 
should nevertheless distrust them; because the history of all 
such governments sufficiently proves that force is their only 



 

law, and that republics particularly have nothing to expect 
from their justice or moderation. At any rate I had much 
rather owe our safety to our own strength than to their jeal- 
ousy of each other ; for however strong and deep-rooted this 
may be, it may be overcome by the temptation of great ag- 
grandizement, and the desire of overturning a government 
which is founded upon principles so opposite to theirs and 
from which their subjects may receive lessons that may once 
more cause the thrones of the earth to totter to their founda- 
tion. I have no idea, however, that England and France 
united could conquer America. But in our present situation, 
if 50,000 of their best disciplined troops were landed in one 
of the Southern States, we should find it a work of time and 
difficulty to get rid of them; and the loss we should sustain 
from their depredations, added to the expenses of our own 
army, would amount to a larger sum than would be sufficient 
to put our militia in such a state of discipline as would deter 
every enemy from our shores. 

One of the greatest modern discoveries in the military art 
consists in the foi'mation and application of light troops. The 
various denominations of these form nearly a moiety of an 
army organized upon the plan of the French tactics, and 
one of the effects of this improvement is to destroy every 
hope of an undisciplined army acting against one of a con- 
trary description. If our Western militia should ever en- 
counter an European army, they would be astonished to find 
themselves opposed by a body of men using the same arms 
with equal dexterity to themselves ; making their attacks with 
the same unexpected velocity, and eluding their enemy with 
all the celerity and address, which distinguishes our back- 
woods riflemen. They would find, however, this essential dif- 
ference in favor of their opponents : whilst their own opera- 
tions would be directed by no fixed plan, but such as might 
be formed on the moment by their leader, their attacks des- 
ultory, uncombined, ill supported, and their retreats dis- 
orderly, — their enemy would manoeuver with all the dexterity 
which discipline alone can give, uniting the consistency and 
combined movements of troops of the line with the alertness 
of partisan corps: such is the effect of "science in war." 
America and France, in their -respective revolutions, found 
themselves attacked by well disciplined armies to which they 
had nothing to oppose but new levies, possessing indeed na- 



 

tive bravery and all the ardor and zeal which are charac- 
teristic of freemen fighting for their liberties, but without 
any knowledge of those evolutions which gave such a decided 
superiority to their enemies in every close encounter. An- 
other mode of warfare was therefore to be pursued ; not new, 
indeed, for the same plan had set bounds to the Roman con- 
quests on the side of Persia; had baffled the legions in the 
zenith of their discipline under Crassus and Mark Anthony, 
and at a later period a most formidable army conducted by 
the great abilities of Julian! The outlines of this plan are: 
to avoid pitched battles and regular engagements, to act by 
detachments on the flanks and rear of the enemy, and by 
cutting ofl: his convoys and incessantly harrassing him to pre- 
vent his advance in front. A system so sage and so well 
adapted to the nature and character of the troops employed 
was crowned with complete success ; America was saved, and 
France was snatched from the grasp of the kings who had 
combined against her. Results so different from those which 
had been calculated on naturally led to the investigation of 
the causes which had produced them. Veteran armies had 
been overthrown by irregular and undisciplined troops. But 
their success could not be imputed to the want of discipline; 
it could be accounted for upon no principles but to the celerity 
of their movements and the manner of their attack. These 
qualities could be as well communicated to regular troops, 
and were possessed indeed by the light corps which, in greater 
or less numbers, were attached to every army. The secret, 
then, consisted in the great multiplication of these, and, from 
the subordinate duties of scouts and convoys, to bring them 
to enact a more distinguished part on the military theatre. 
A great revolution was thus pi'oduced in tactics ; celerity of 
movement was the great desideratum, and light infantry, 
light or horse artillery, and tirailleurs, or rifle men, became 
the order of the day, and at present form no inconsiderable 
portion of the armies of Europe. An improvement in tac- 
tics which gives a greater superiority to the professed soldier 
who fights for conquest over the citizen who bears arms only 
in the defence of his country, is perhaps to be regretted; 
and no alternative is left to the latter but to perfect them- 
selves in the same arts and discipline. 

But the defence of our country against a foreign enemy 
does not constitute the only motive for our citizens to per- 



 

feet themselves in the military art. The safety of a republic 
depends as much upon the equality of arms and discipline 
amongst its citizens as upon the equality of rights. We must 
become a nation of warriors, or a nation of Quakers; we 
must proscribe every attempt at military improvement, or 
its study must become universal. Whenever a knowledge of 
that art is confined to a minority of the people, that minority 
will govern. So true is this maxim that no instance can be 
produced of a free people preserving their liberties who suf- 
fered the military spirit to decline amongst them, nor of any 
losing them as long as this spirit pervaded the body of the 
nation. It was not until the amusements of the theatre, the 
baths, and the public gardens had superseded the exercises 
of the Campus Martins, that a Roman army dared to revolt 
against its country. In the ages of Papirius, of Fabricius, 
of Fabius, and Scipio, the information of the revolt of one 
of their armies would have given rise to no other sentiment 
than indignation in the Roman Senate. What had the re- 
public to fear from 40 or 50,000 of its misguided sons, when 
she possessed within her bosom six times the number, equally 
brave, equally skilled in the use of arms, and inured by early 
habit to all the duties of war? Such however was not the 
case when the daring ambition of Caesar had raised the 
standard of rebellion, and at the head of the army of Gaul 
approached the capitol. The successors of that Senate which 
after a series of terrible defeats had derided the efforts of 
the great Pyrrhus, and the still greater Hannibal, — who with 
all the deliberation which conscious security inspires, had dis- 
patched a reinforcement to their army in Spain, when their 
most formidable enemy was encamped under their walls, — 
trembled at the approach of Caesar, abandoned their country 
to an usurper, and condescended to seek in the distant prov- 
inces that succor for Rome which Rome itself no longer af- 
forded. Still had she to boast of a large list of patriots, and 
at no former period was the art of war so well understood. 
But it had become a distinct profession; martial exercises 
were neglected by the body of the people. No longer in every 
Roman citizen was to be found a Roman soldier. That dis- 
tinguished appellation was not, indeed, as at a later period, 
exclusively enjoyed by mercenaries, alike strangers to the 
laws, the manners, and the language of Rome. The army 
was chiefly composed of citizens, but of citizens who in the 



 

habits of wai-fare and pillage had forgotten the sacred duties 
which that character imposes, and were as willing to turn 
their arms against their country, upon the command of their 
chief, ap the enemy whom they were raised to oppose. Such 
will ever be the case with men who make war a profession; 
and the fate of Rome will be the fate of America, and of 
every other republic, which does not take effectual means to 
inspire its citizens with a military spirit, and train them to 
the use of arms. 

It is much to be regretted that a disposition adverse to 
improvement in the military art should exist amongst the 
people of the Western country ; and it is the more surprising 
as it does not arise from the want of military spirit, but 
from a belief that discipline is unnecessary, and that the 
untutored rifleman is the most formidable of all warriors. 
Certain events in the history of the Western country have 
given strength to this opinion. "The regular and disciplined 
armies," say its advocates, "of Braddock and St. Clair, were 
defeated by the savages, as these have frequently been by 
undisciplined militia; therefore undisciplined militia armed 
with rifles, are superior to regular troops, armed with the 
musket and bayonet." There is so much plausibility in this 
reasoning, and so much mischief in the opinion it supports, 
that too much pains cannot be taken to shew the fallacy of 
the one, and entirely to eradicate the other. It is not diffi- 
cult to conceive that an army in the highest state of discipline 
may be placed in such a situation by the unskilfulness of its 
leader as to make it an easy prey to the rudest savages. The 
destruction of the Roman legions in Germany under Varus, 
and the army of Braddock in America, are two out of many 
instances of this kind with which history will furnish us. 
But this same history will also inform us that, notwithstand- 
ing a battle may be gained, or even a campaign successfully 
terminated, by undisciplined valor acting against veteran 
troops, it has never happened that a nation which cultivated 
the military art has been subdued by one which set no value 
on its attainment. The subversion of the Roman empire by 
barbarians forms no exception to this opinion; for those 
barbarians were superior to the then Romans, in every mar- 
tial, and almost in every civil, virtue. Of those legions which 
had conquered the world, feeble skeletons only remained ; dis- 
tinguished indeed by the ensigns which had once directed the 



 

skillful evolutions of a brave and free people, but which had 
become disgraced by the protection of effeminate slaves, who 
were as much unable to bear the arms and perform the exer- 
cise of Roman soldiers as to comprehend the fire of patriotism 
and liberty which animated the armies of Marcellus and 
Scipio. But although discipline and valor were no longer 
the characteristics of a Roman army, the tactics of the earlier 
ages were not entirely forgotten, a few individuals still read 
the immortal works of Caesar and Polybius, and the small 
remains of military science were suflicient to sustain for 
many ages the tottering fabrick of the empire, assailed on 
all sides by immense swarms of warlike barbarians. Never 
were the effects of generalship more conspicuous than in the 
achievements of Aetius and Boniface, of Belisarius and 
Narses. These great men, placed at the head of armies which 
were little better than bands of undisciplined plunderers, were 
enabled by a series of artful manoeuvres to render useless 
the great superiority of their enemies in numbers and valor. 
But hundreds of instances are to be found in the Roman 
and Grecian histories to shew the great inferiority of mere 
courage, with the advantage of numbers and even of skill in 
the soldier in the management of his arms, when opposed to 
troops who can manoeuvre well, and are commanded by gen- 
erals possessing genius and science. What has been said 
above of the success of raw troops in the American and French 
revolutions is not incompatible with this opinion, but rather 
tends to confirm it. The advantage of talents in the generals 
was certainly on the side of America and France, and they 
very wisely adapted their operations to the kind of troops they 
commanded. The alertness and activity of these troops en- 
abled them to perform great marches with facility. They 
were therefore employed in a desultory warfare — to harrass 
the enemy and cut off his convoys ; and by this means time was 
gained to form an army capable of meeting him in an equal 
field. It was in this kind of warfare that the great eflScacy 
of the rifle was first discovered ; and altho' scarcely known in 
the European armies at the commencement of the American 
revolution, it has now become a favorite weapon, to be em- 
ployed as a corps avance, or upon the wings and rear of an 
enemy ; but no general has ever thought of making it a sub- 
stitute for the musket and bayonet. No species of troops are 
more to be dreaded than a good rifle corps, when acting under 



 

the cover of fences, hedges, or forests. But in an open coun- 
try, when opposed either to cavalry or infantry, the rifle is the 
most contemptible of all arms. The musket and bayonet are 
adapted to all situations. 

The volunteers who served under you, my dear General, in 
the campaign of 1794, acknoAvledged, I think, that no number 
of riflemen could have resisted the charge of General Wayne's 
army on the 20th of August of that year. Nothing can shew 
more clearly than the result of this action does that the defeat 
of Braddock is not to be attributed to the kind of arms which 
were in the hands of his men, nor to their want of valor, but 
to the deficiency of the general in the talents to adapt his 
manoeuvres to the nature of the country and the enemy he had 
to encounter. Close order and platoon firing will not answer 
in a forest. Philip of Macedon conquered Greece, and his son 
Alexander the empire of Persia, by the strength of the 
phalanx. But this formidable body could not operate in 
broken or uneven ground ; and whenever it was opposed by a 
general who had the talents to take advantage of this circum- 
stance, and commanded by one who would suffer himself to 
be drawn into a situation unfavorable to its operations, its de- 
struction was certain. If General Wayne had marched his 
army in close columns instead of those long flexible columns in 
files which enabled him to penetrate the woods with facility 
and to present a very extended front to the enemy on every 
point of attack, if he had neglected to reconnoiter the country 
in every direction as he advanced to prevent an attack from 
the enemy before he completed his disposition to receive them, 
or if, instead of putting them up with the bayonet and keeping 
up the charge until they were entirely broken and dispersed, 
he had permitted them to exercise their skill in distant shoot- 
ing from behind trees, — the 20th of August, 1794, would now 
have produced as melancholy recollections as the 4th of No- 
vember, 1791. 

But I am persuaded that, from a particular examination 
of the campaigns and battles which took place in the course 
of the war between the people of the Western country and 
the Indians, it would appear that whenever the former have 
been successful, a considerable poi'tion of that success is to 
be attributed to the military knowledge of their leaders ; and 
that when this was wanting, their valor and great accuracy 
in shooting the rifle did not always secure them from defeat. 



 

Your own, and the campaigns of Clark and Wilkinson, are in- 
stances of the former; as the defeats of Crawford, Loughery, 
and the Blue Licks, are of the latter. I have examined the 
ground which was the scene of the defeat at the Blue Licks ; 
and if I was correctly informed as to the disposition of the 
two armies, it appears to me that nothing could have been 
more easy than to entrap the Indians in the very toils which 
they had prepared for their adversaries. The ambuscade was 
well arranged to ensnare a rash and imprudent enemy, but 
the smallest degree of military skill upon the part of the Ken- 
tucky commander would have been sufficient to put the Indians 
in the very cid dn sac which proved so fatal to himself and his 
men. I am far from thinking so unfavorably of the rifle as 
our valued friend the late General Wayne. The convert fight- 
ing which that arm requires was so contrary to the ardor of 
his disposition, which was for deciding everything with the 
bayonet, that he always declared that the use of the rifle would 
make cowards of the bravest troops. Instead of wishing to 
see the rifle banished from our armies, considering the nature 
of our country and the great predilection of the people of the 
Western States in its favor, I would recommend that at least 
two-thirds of the militia of this section of the Union should 
be armed with it. The prejudices which have been nourished 
by long habit are very difficult to remove. Our backwoods- 
men could not easily be induced to give up their favorite arm, 
nor indeed does there appear any necessity for it. If the 
Western States were to form a separate nation, it would be 
proper so to organize its force so as to have all the various 
descriptions of troops which compose a modern army ; but as 
the tie which unites us to the Atlantic states is, I hope, indis- 
soluble, the whole militia of the Union should be considered as 
one great army; and in the distribution of the several corps 
particular regard should be had to the manners, the habits, 
and even the prejudices of the people. This circumstance has 
been attended to with great advantage by every military na- 
tion, and in every age. 

A Roman army was thought to be most formidable when the 
strength of the legions was supported by the velites or light 
troops of the neighboring allies — the Numidian horse (the 
hussars of the ancients), the cavalry of Thessaly, and the 
slingers of the Ballearean isles. Even in the formation of the 
present European armies, the habits of the people are par- 



 

ticularly regarded in their military destinations. Neither the 
emperors of Germany or France, or the king of England, 
would think of recruiting their cavalry in the mountains of 
the Tyrol, the cantons of Switzerland, or the highlands of 
Scotland. Nor would the former of these princes find his ac- 
count in reducing to infantry battalions those fine bodies of 
hussars with which his Hungarian and Polish provinces sup- 
ply him. The people of the latter countries have been ac- 
customed for ages to make war on horseback. They make 
the finest light cavalry in the world, but contemptible infantry. 
In the formation of a grand army of the Union, the militia of 
the Western country might compose the corps avarice, consist- 
ing of mounted and dismounted riflemen, and all the various 
descriptions of light cavalry. The Eastern and Middle States 
would furnish the artillery and infantry of the line, and those 
of the South the cavalry of the line and light infantry. No cav- 
alry in the world would excel those, my dear General, which our 
native State could produce. For fleetness and fire the horses 
are equal to those of the ancient Capadocia or Thessaly ; and 
for grace and dexterity in the management of them, the 
natives are unrivalled. Possessing as we do, then, the mate- 
rials for forming a national militia which shall unite all the 
desirable qualities of the best appointed European army, why 
do we not give them that polish of which they are so eminently 
susceptible? It is admitted by all that the times are por- 
tentous. The storm which has so long desolated the old world, 
has never presented to us an aspect more threatning. Its 
violence has yet reached that only [our commerce], which to 
lose is not death. Shall we bewail the loss of our commerce, 
when competency and liberty remain? But the latter can be 
preserved only by the arms and discipline which obtained it. 
Why then is there so much indifference manifested upon this 
all-important subject? Why is year after year suffered to 
roll away without the adoption of some efficient plan? If 
there is difficulty in the thing, is not that difficulty constantly 
increasing as the devouring hand of time constantly deprives 
us of those from whom we could derive instruction? The 
heroes of the Revolution are fast sinking in the grave. Shall 
we not seize the moment when enough are left to animate us, 
by their precept and example, to the attainment of those mili- 
tary accomplishments which are so necessary for the defence 
of our country? Will a nation of freemen suflfer themselves 



 

to be outdone in any honorable pursuit by the vile instruments 
of ambition and tyranny, which compose the armies of Europe 
— "a band of mercenaries whose only hope is that of pay, 
whose only fear is that of punishment"? 

It is to obtain your protest, my dear sir, against the ineflfi- 
cient and ridiculous systems of discipline with which the peo- 
ple have been so long and so uselessly harrassed which has in- 
duced me to trouble you with the forgoing observations. 

Your State possesses an advantage which is scarcely left to 
any other in the Union, — of three distinguished revolutionary 
officers to direct the efforts of its citizens in the attainment 
of military information. The exertions of a Scott, a Hopkins, 
and a Posey, might be sufficient to put into operation a system 
that would soon pervade the continent, which would vindicate 
the American character for having neglected that to which 
Rome and Athens were indebted for their glory, and without 
which no republic can long exist — a disciplined militia. 

That you may be amongst the last of those who may be 
called to enjoy in another world the happiness you have de- 
served for contributing to emancipate a nation in this, is the 
sincere prayer of, dear sir. 

Your friend

Sir: 

I have lately received information from sources which leave 
no room to doubt its correctness, that the Shawnee Prophet is 
again exciting the Indians to Hostilities against the United 
States. A Trader [Michael Brouillette] who is entirely to be 
depended on, and who has lately returned from the residence 
of the Prophet, assures me that he has at least 1000 Souls 
under his immediate control (perhaps 3.50 or 400 men) prin- 
cipally composed of Kickapoos and Winebagos, but with a con- 
siderable number of Potawatimies and Shawanees and a few 
Chippewas and Ottowas. 

The friends of the Fr«nch Traders amongst the Indians 



 

have advised them to separate themselves from the Amer- 
icans in this town lest they should suffer in the attack, which 
they meditate against the latter. 

I have no doubt that the present hostile disposition of the 
Prophet and his Votaries has been produced by British inter- 
ference. It is certain that they have received a considerable 
supply of ammunition from that source.' They refused to buy 
that which was offered them by the Traders alleging that they 
had as much as they wanted, and when it was expended they 
could get more without paying for it and the former appeared 
to the traders to be the fact, from the abundance the Indians 
seemed to possess. 

I have before done myself the honor to describe to you the 
exposed situation of this Town [Vincennes] and how sus- 
ceptible it is of surprise by a very small force. The Militia 
in the country are so scattered that they could not be collected 
in time enough to be of any service in repelling an attack. 
There are not more than a full company of American Militia 
in the town, and the French for any military purpose are 
worth nothing. 

I think it probable that the British agents in Canada have 
anticipated the orders of their government in their endeavours 
to set the Indians upon us, and that the first account of a fa- 
vorable change of disposition towards America in that Gov- 
ernment will induce them to countermand the orders, which 
have been given to their Indian allies. 

But in the mean time, the report of the Indians having 
meditated hostilities will do us great injury by retarding the 
settlement of the country. We lost several hundred families 
last spring in consequence of the hostile appearances they ex- 
hibited and I am persuaded that similar consequences will flow 
from those which are now manifested. And it will probably 

1. As an example see Mich. Pioneer and Hist. Soc. Pub. XXIII, 70 for a "Requisi- 
tion for an extra quantity of goods to supply his Majesty's Indian stores witii presents 
in case of a war with the U. S. for 1809." Among the items are 

Gunpowder 180,000 lbs. 

Flints 24.000 

Lead bars 1.000 lbs. 

The total distribution at this time amounted to over SI 50.000. In an official dispatch 
of Lord CastlericKh to Sir James Ciaie. of Canada is this paragraph : 

"Under an undefined relation with the U. S. I entirely concur in your position, 
that attention must be kept up to conciliate the Indian tribes upon the following prin- 
ciple that if in a contest they are not to be employed to act with us. they will be 
engaged to act against us, and that we are not to consider so much their use as 
allies as their destructiveness as enemies." 



 

be normally the case unless the rascally prophet is driven from 
his present position or a fort built somewhere on the Wabash, 
about the upper boundary of the late purchase. I beg leave 
to recommend this measure most earnestly to the President. 
It is one from which the greatest advantages would arise both 
to the Territory and to the United States. 

Under cover of this Fort the new purchase and this will 
settle rapidly and a Militia force be collected on the Wabash, 
that would be able to cope with all the Indians in the neigh- 
borhood. 

The public arms in my possession are much in want of 
cleaning. Shall I be authorized to employ a person to do it?

Since my letter was written which I sent by the last mail 
I have heard nothing new on the subject of Indian hostilities. 
The French Traders are however more alarmed than I have 
ever seen them In consequence of which I have deemed it ex- 
pedient to send up Mr. [IMichael] Brouillette (the person pre- 
viously employed) to the Prophets Town to watch his move- 
ments and to assure the fidelity of the neighbouring bands of 
Potawatomies. He set out this day and as there is a consid- 
erable degree of danger in the undertaking (from private as- 
sassination) I have employed another Frenchman [Touissant 
Dubois] at 12 dollars per month to go with him. This was 
the more necessary as all the French traders have left the 
Prophet's village. 

I have taken the liberty of enclosing you a letter to Genl. 
[James] Wilkinson containing a document he wrote to me for 
and which he thinks necessary to the vindication of his char- 
acter. [This letter has not been found]

ViNCENNES 15th May 1810 

Hwr. Pa. 290-29J, 

Sir: 

A Potawatimie squaw, who is the wife of Mr. Johnson's 
Interpreter at Fort Wayne arrived at this place a few days 
ago. On her way she stayed several days at the Prophets 
Town. The information she brings, entirely corroborates 
that which I had received of the hostile intentions of the 
Prophet and his followers. Several of her relations told her, 
that the Indians of that quarter had determined to go to war 
with the white people and from the conversations which she 
overheard she is convinced that such is the fact. She par- 
ticularly states, that having retired to rest in a cabin, but not 
being asleep, she heard their warriors conversing on the sub- 
ject as a matter absolutely determined on. One of them ob- 
served that he was apprehensive of the want of ammunition ; 
but was answered by another that the chiefs would certainly 
take care of that matter and they could no doubt obtain more 
from the same source that had already furnished them with 
a supply. She thinks (and of that opinion also is an intel- 
ligent trader here) that the ammunition alluded to had been 
furnished by a British subject now there who pretends to be 
a Clerk for the Macanac Company. 

I cannot think the plans of the Prophet are so well matured 
as they are supposed to be, and I rather suppose that the thing 
is to be finally settled at a great council now about to be holden 
some where between the Wabash and Lake Michigan, most 
probably at the St. Joseph of the latter. I have confidence in 
Winemac, a Potawatomi chief who is now with the Prophet, 
and I am certain that his utmost exertions will be used, in 
the first place, to prevent hostilities or if he should be unsuc- 
cessful in this to give me information of their designs. 

He sent me word by the woman above-mentioned that he 
would come to me as soon as the council was over; but she 
added that his attachment to the U. States was so well known, 
that he was closely watched. It was more than possible that 
he was not admitted to their secret councils and that it was 
also more than probable that he would be assassinated. The 
Prophets force at present consists in the part of his own Tribe 
which has always been attached to him ; nearly all the Kicka- 
poos, a number of winebagoes, some Hurons from Detrot who 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 421 

have lately joined him, a number of Potawatomies, 20 or 30 
Muskoes or Creeks and some straglers from the Ottawas, 
Chippeways and other tribes in all perhaps from 6 to 800. 
If the disaffection extends to all the Tribes between the Illi- 
nois River and Lake Michigan, the number will be doubled, 
and however contemptable this force may seem, it is capable, 
from the nature of our frontier settlements of spreading 
slaughter and devastation to an immense extent. I am still 
of opinion however that the Indians will not dare to commence 
hostilities, unless the U. States should go to war with England, 
or appearances be so strong in favour of its being the case, 
that the emisaries of that power may think themselves justi- 
fiable in urging the Indians to immediate action. Under the 
influence of this opinion I have taken no extraordinary means 
for preparing the Militia for action, because at this season of 
the year, any interruption to the farmers is productive of 
great loss and any such steps taken by me would spread an 
alarm, that would greatly retard the emigration to this coun- 
try and perhaps induce many to move off that are already 
settled. I have however taken every step, which I thought 
likely to counteract the Prophet's designs and to obtain early 
information of the proceedings of the meeting which is about 
to take place. Mr. [John] Conner, the Delaware Interpreter, 
arrived a few days ago with a young Chief from the Delaware 
Towns. He informs me that a deputation from that tribe had 
been sent to the Indian Council, and that they were instructed 
to dissuade the other Tribes from listening to the Prophet. 
Conners will take up a speech from me to the Delawares, in 
which I have pointed out the enevitable destruction that awaits 
all these tribes which shall dare to take up the hatchet against 
their fathers, and the great danger that the friendly tribes 
would incur if war should be kindled, from the difficulty of 
discriminating friends from foes. I have desired the chiefs 
to send some faithful man after their deputies with fresh 
instructions which I have dictated and have promised to com- 
pensate the former for his trouble. I have also sent for the 
leading member of the Shaker Society (a religious sect of very 
extraordinary principles which you may have heard of) who 
resides about 20 miles from this place, with the intention of 
prevailing on him to take a speech to the Prophet. This 
scoundrel (the Prophet) affects to follow the Shaker prin- 
ciples in everything but the vow of celebacy and the above 



 

mentioned leader has assured me that he believes the Prophet 
to be under the same divine inspiration that he himself is (a 
circumstance by no means improbable) but that for reasons 
growing out of his situation as a savage he was still permitted, 
with his immediate followers, to cohabit with women.'

Sir: 

Since my letter of last week a gentleman arrived here di- 
rectly from Chicago. He informs me that the Indians were 
all quiet in that quarter and he supposes that the Prophet was 
rather losing ground than otherwise amongst the Indians of 
the Illinois River. This information will not cause me to 
relax my vigilance in watching the motions of the Prophet.

Upon my return from an excursion to a distant part of the 
Territory on the 9th Instant I found the two letters which 
you did me the honor to write on the 10th ultimo.' Since my 

1. Shakertown, sixteen miles north of Vincennes was founded by religious en- 
thusiasts from Kentucky in 1805. It was a co-operative society, holding property in

Esarey. Indiana, II, 973 
1. These letters have not been found but Dawson, Harrismi, 139 gives the following 

quotation and substance from them : 

"In conformity with the recommendation of the Governor respecting a detachment 

of men, as well as the establishment of a post on the Wabash, he received a letter 

from the secretary at war, of which the following is the extract which relates to the 

subject : 

"If it shall be, in your judgment, necessary to establish a post on the Wabash, 



 

arrival I have received information fi'om various sources 
which has produced an entire conviction on my mind that 
the prophet is organizing a most extensive combination 
against the United States and that his schemes are rapidly- 
advancing to maturity. The particulars that have reached 
me I shall now proceed to detail. 

The circumstance in this affair which has surprised me 
most is the defection of the Hurons or Wyandots. This Tribe 
although inferior in number to most of the others have always 
had great influence on the Indian Councils. 

The other Tribes call them their Uncles and venerate them 
for their superior wisdom, valor and intelligence, to them the 
custody of the Great Belt which was the Symbol of Union 
between the Tribes in their late war with the United States 
was committed — as it was the original duplicate of the Treaty 
of Greenville. The Prophet knowing the great advantage he 
would derive from gaining over this Tribe to his interests 
attempted it and has succeeded. It appears that some short 
time since he sent to them a deputation expressing his sur- 
prise that the Wyandotts who had directed the councils of 
the other Tribes in the War and to whom was committed the 
care of the Belt which had united all the Tribes as well as 
the Treaty with the White people should sit still and see the 
property of all the Indians usurped by a pact. That he was 
desirous of seeing those Treaties to know what they contained. 
The Wyandots answered that they had preserved vdth care 
the belt which had formerly united all the Tribes as one na- 
tion that it has remained so long in their hands without an 
inquiry being made after it that they had supposed it was 
forgotten. They were glad however that it was at length 

and within the late purchase. I shall confide in the knowledge of the country, of the 
objects to be embraced, and of service, peculiar to Governor Harrison, to give such 
instructions to the commandinK officer as ay be necessary.' In another letter, of the 
same date, he informs him that "Captain Posey had been directed to move with a 
company, as full as the detachment at Newport, Ky. would admit, and. on his arrival 
at Vincennes, to report himself to the Governor.* And in a subsequent letter, July 5, 
he was infoi-med that 120 men, under the command of Captain Cross, were also descend- 
ing the Ohio from Pittsburgh. Their destination had been Bellefontaine, near St. 
Louis : but they had orders to halt at Newport, and were put at the disposal of the 
Governor, provided he might think their presence necessary at Vincennes. It was 
also stated, that a part of the Sixth regiment would be ordered to Pittsburgh, to be 
reinforced as circumstances might require : and that it was expected an accommodation 
would be effected between the government of the United States and that of Great 
Britain, as far as that hostilities were not to be apprehended. Captain Floyd was 
ordered to Vincennes, to take command of the troops on their arrival : he being repre- 
sented, by the secretary at war, as 'a brave and capable officer'." [See July 7, below] 

Dawson, Harriaon, 1S9 



 

called for, for their own parts they were tired of their situ- 
ation that they had nothing nearer their hearts than to see 
all the various tribes united again as one man. They looked 
upon everything that had been done since the Treaty of 
Greenville between the white people and Indians as good for 
nothing and that they would unite their exertions to the 
Prophet's to bring together all the Tribes and to get them to 
unite to put a stop to the encroachments of the white people 
and endeavour to recover what had been unjustly taken from 
them. That they had been driven back until they could go 
no further and that they had as well die where they were as 
to be driven upon other Indians who would probably attack 
them. This appears to have been the substance of the an- 
swer sent to the Prophet and which was immediately circu- 
lated through all the Tribes. The effect has been that those 
who were before indifferent or inimical to the view of the 
Prophet are now hastening to him from every direction. The 
Wyandots passed through the Miami village of Mississine- 
way 10 or 12 days ago on their way to the Prophet. At a 
conference with the Miami chiefs they produced the great 
Belt before spoken of and reproached the Miamis with having 
deserted their Indian Friends and united themselves with 
the White people. The Miamis were so intimidated that they 
consented to attend the meeting at the Prophets Town and 
have sent for the Weas to join them at Mississineway from 
whence they vdll proceed together to the Tippecanoe. A chief 
of the Weas has been just sent to me for the purpose of com- 
municating to me the object of their intended journey. It is 
from this chief who is entirely to be depended upon and two 
other persons of the Wea Tribe that the principal part of the 
above information is derived. 

A few nights ago an Indian [Grosble] of the Piankeshaw 
Tribe came to the House of Mr. [Touissant] Dubois (a French 
Gentleman who lives about a mile above the Town) after the 
family had retired to bed and told him that he had something 
of importance to communicate to him which was by all means 
to remove from his present residence and retire over the Mis- 
sissippi as he might soon expect troublesome times if he re- 
mained where he was. 

The old Piankeshaw chief Grosbles who is particularly at- 
tached to the United States and personally to myself came to me 
yesterday and asked my permission to remove over the Missis- 



 

sippi alledging that he heard amongst the Indians nothing 
but the news of War and as he intended to take no part in 
it he wished to be out of danger. Today he has informed me 
that the Prophet had actually formed a plan to surprise this 
Town. He intends in the guise of friendship to come here 
with a large body of men that 4 or 5 would be assigned to 
each house and himself with 12 or 15 would enter mine and 
having destroyed one a signal would be given by a person 
posted for that purpose to commence the Massacre in the 
town. This fellow has boasted that he would follow the foot- 
steps of the Great Pontiac. 

Brouillette is still at the Prophets Town the information 
that he has given me is that there are as far as he can ascer- 
tain about 3,000 men within 30 miles of the Prophets Town, 
that they are constantly councilling but that they are very 
secret in their proceedings. He has however been informed 
by his friends that it is determined at least to prevent the 
surveyors from surveying lines west of the Wabash. 

I am still of opinion that the British are the real authors 
of these movements on the part of the Indians and I think 
it probable that if our differences are speedily arranged with 
that power (an event which appears from the last papers 
received here as remote as ever) that we shall have no In- 
dian War. But I think it not impossible for the purpose of 
increasing our difficulties and embarrassments that corrupt 
Government may have urged the Indians to commence hos- 
tilities altho they have no intention of going to War them- 
selves. It is very certain that a large party amongst the 
Indians are ripe for it and many others only restrained by 
fear. I anticipate here a question from you Sir, "As the 
United States have upon all occasions manifested the strictest 
justice in their transactions with the Indians how then does 
it happen that they are not sensible of this and that they 
should be governed by a power which has so often deceived 
them and from whose intrigues, and bad ait'ice they have 
formerly suffered as much?" My answer is that there is 
nothing about which nations are more divided than the causes 
of their misfortunes. We frequently find them attributed to 
causes the most opposite. The Indians of this country are 
in fact miserable. The game which was formerly so abundant 
is now so scarce as barely to afford subsistance to the most 



 

active hunters. The greater part of each tribe are half the 
year in a state of starvation and astonishing as it may seem 
these remote savages have felt their full share of the mis- 
fortunes which the trouble in Europe have brought upon 
■^he greater part of the world. The exclusion of the English 
from the continent of Europe where they were accustomed 
to dispose of the greater part of the peltries imported from 
Canada has reduced the price of those articles almost to 
nothing. The Indian can scarcely procure for them the nec- 
essary ammunition and they are often induced to forego the 
purchase of this necessary article to gratify their passion for 
whisky. Finding themselves thus destitute and miserable is 
it surprising that their misfortunes were produced by the ex- 
tension of the American settlements? A portion of the en- 
lightened American people have been taught to believe by the 
emisaries of the same government that the embarrassments 
we labour under have grown out of the measures of our own 
Government rather than the unjust and inequitous decrees of 
their master. Is it wonderful then that ignorant half starved 
savages have been seduced by men who so well understand 
the arts of deception? 

Har. Pa. 296-299 incl. 

June 15th. A boat which I sent up the Wabash with the 
annuity salt for the Indians returned this day. The person 
who had charge of her reports to me that the Prophet and 
the Kickapoos who are with him refused to receive that which 
he was directed to deliver to them. On his way up he was 
directed by the Prophet to leave the salt on the bank of the 
River as he could not determine whether he would receive it 
or not until his Brother the War Chief whom he had sent to 
Detroit and whom he daily expected should arrive. Upon the 
return of the boat the master was directed to take the salt 
on board as they had determined to have nothing to do with 
it. Whilst the hands were rolling in the barrels the brother 
of the Prophet seized the master and several others by the 
hair and shook them violently asking whether they were 
Americans. They were all young Frenchmen. They insulted 
Mr. Brouillette at the same time calling him an American 
Dog and a Young Putawatomie Chief directed some of his 
men to plunder his house which they immediately did of all 
his provisions, tobacco etc. Brouillette is not known as an 



 

agent of mine by the Indians. He keeps a few articles of 
trade to disguise his real character.- The boatmen inform 
me that the conduct of the above mentioned Potawatomi was 
highly displeasing to the greater part of his Tribe and that 
the chief Winamac^ is an open and avowed friend of the 
United States. He is now on his way to this place. I have 
an entire confidence in his integrity and attachment and will 
take care to encourage it. 

This day a party of lowas twenty in number arrived here — 
they parted between this and the Illinois River with a large 
number of Sac's, Foxes and Winebagos amounting they say 
to eleven hundred- — all going to the Prophet and to the British, 
they say also that the Marpack [or Main Poc] the Pota- 
watomie chief of the Illinois River has taken the same direc- 
tion with his people. 

Notwithstanding the above strong symptoms of hostile dis- 
position upon the part of the Indians I think it yet possible 
to bring the council about to be held at the Prophet's town 
to a favorable result and you may rely upon it Sir that I 
shall leave no means untried which my knowledge of the 
Indian Character and of the Individual Chiefs shall suggests 
as having that tendency. I know that all the chiefs of the 
Miamis, Delawares, Weas and a majority of the Potawatomies 
are as inimical to the Prophet and his projects as they are 
friendly to the United States. But as it is much easier to 
persuade a savage to do mischief than to dissuade him from 
it, I fear that the bold and popular eloquence of that artful 
scoundi-el promising them a rich harvest of blood and plunder 
from our defenceless frontiers may seduce the young men 
from their duty to their chiefs and that the latter seeing 
opposition fruitless may be induced to swim vdth the cur- 
rent. Knowing that in a case of this kind savages are only 
operated upon by their fears I shall use with them a very 
decisive language pointing out the advantages of peace and 

2. The Prophet contended to Dubois that he was not unfriendly to the Americans 
but that he was continually misrepresented by drunken Indians at Vincennes. In 
further conversation he declared the Indians had been robbed of all their lands, and 
that no land cession was valid unless approved by all the tribe ; that he had been 
directed by the great spirit to settle at the mouth of the Tippecanoe, and there collect 
all the Indians.

same name, one friendly to and the other hostile to the United States. The one

the inevitable destruction which war with the United States 
will bring upon them. 

Col. [Francis] Vigo a French Gentleman who has resided 
in this country upwards of thirty years and whom I have be- 
fore advantageously employed in missions of this kind will 
set out immediately for the Miami Village of Mississineawy 
where there will be a meeting of the three Tribes which bear 
the General appelation of Miamis previously to their going 
to the Prophet. The object is to ascertain what impression 
has been made upon them by the Wyandots in favor of the 
Prophet's schemes and to strengthen their fidelity towards 
the United States. As soon as I hear that the Indians have 
generally collected at the Prophets I shall send them a speech 
such as I think calculated to reassure our friends and intimi- 
date those that are hostile. In the mean time I shall spare 
no pains or reasonable expense to gain correct information. 

June 19th. The greater part of the information contained 
above has hitherto been communicated to two or three con- 
fidential persons only as I was extremely averse to create any 
alarm until the necessity for it should appear unequivocal, 
but since the return of the salt boat the report of the crew 
of the number of Indians collected around the Prophet and 
the insolence of their conduct has created so much appre- 
hension upon the part of the citizens that I deemed it ad- 
visable to assemble the public officers the merchants and other 
respectable citizens to take their advice upon the subject of 
putting the country in a state of defence. To these gentle- 
men the danger appeared so imminent that they unanimously 
urged and advised me to call two companies into actual serv- 
ice and to put all the rest of the Militia upon the alert — this 
has accordingly been done and alarm posts established and 
such other measures adopted as the occasion called for and 
my means would allow. The inconvenience to the men of 
calling them out at the season of approaching harvest ^vill 
be considered and the consideration and the expense which 
will attend the measure would have prevented me from adopt- 
ing it if I had the least room to doubt the correctness of the 
information I have received of the hostile designs of the 
Prophet and particularly his having marked out the place as 
the first object of his attack. And it is by no means im- 
probable that some display of Military preparation here would 
have no inconsiderable effect upon the proceedings of the 



 

council at Tepaconoe. Altho no people are more brave than 
the Indians when in actual danger like all undisciplined war- 
riors collected together in large bodies they are subject to 
unaccountable paroxysms of terror the effect of which no rea- 
son or argument can control whilst increasing their deter- 
mination to receive or reject the propositions of the Prophet 
a sensation of this sort ought to be easily executed by a sim- 
ultaneous feint of the militia from some points on the Ohio 
and the Great Miami and from this place which would very 
probably break up the meeting. I have it not in my power 
to make those movements but I will contrive to have a report 
circulated at a proper moment that troops are actually as- 
sembling at those points and it may perhaps produce as much 
effect as if it were actually the case. 

Perhaps Sir from the station I occupy it may be expected 
from me that I should give some opinion of the steps proper 
to be taken if war with the Indians should actually take place. 
It appears to me all important then to act with the utmost 
vigor in the commencement of such war when the first act 
of hostility takes place. I am persuaded that several of the 
Tribes and a number of individuals of those who are actually 
engaged in it will be opposed to it and many more will be 
politic enough to keep in the back ground for a while to ob- 
serve its progress. Any extraordinary success on the part 
of the hostile Indians would have the certain effect of 
strengthening their party and discouraging our friends and 
a confederacy which in the commencement would be feeble 
and discordant would become cemented and extended to a 
degree that would make it a work of time and difficulty for 
us to crush. The Militia of the Western country acting on 
Horseback might in the course of a very few weeks sweep the 
whole hostile district from the Wabash to the Illinois River 
and Lake Michigan of every enemy. I say on horseback, for 
celerity of movement is essentially necessary to their success. 
The Militia of this section of the Union are entirely without 
discipline and vastly inferior to what they were at the close 
of the late Indian war. In an encounter with the Indians 
they would inevitably be beaten unless greatly superior in 
numbers but from our vicinity to the Indian towns and our 
intimate knowledge of the country the former might be easily 
surprised by mounted infantry. 



 

Capt. Posey^ has not yet arrived nor have I indeed heard 
of his leaving Cincinnati. An Eastern mail arrives at Louis- 
ville Kentucky twice a week to this place but once a week. 
Should anything very interesting occur in two or three days 
I will send a special express to Louisville to deposit a letter 
which shall contain it, in the office at that place. 

I have the honor to be with greatest respect

Fort Wayne, June 24, 1810 

Dawson, Harrison, H-1 

Dear Sir, 

A person just arrived who, it appears, has lost himself on 
his route to Vincennes, affords me an opportunity of an- 
nouncing to you my return to this post. I was delayed on 
my journey, in attendting to the transportation of the public 
goods; and on my arrival in the state of Ohio, I had learned 
that the prophet's brother had lately been at work among the 
Shawanese on the Au-glaize, and, among other things, had 
burned your letter delivered to the chiefs at this place last 
fall. I accordingly took Wapaghkonetta [Ohio] in my route 
home, assembled the chiefs, and demanded the reason why 
they had suffered such an improper act to be committed at 
their door. They disavowed all agency in the transaction; 
and their entire disapprobation of the prophet's conduct, and 
concurring circumstances, satisfied me that they were sincere. 
The white persons at the town, informed me that not one of 
the chiefs would go into council with the prophet's brother, 
and that it was a preacher, named Riddle, who took the let- 
ter, to have it interpreted, and that the brother of the prophet 
took it from his hand, and threw it into the fire; declaring, 
that if Governor Harrison was there, he would serve him so. 
He told the Indians that the white people and the Govern- 
ment were deceiving them, and that, for his part, he never

would believe them, or put any confidence in them— that he 
never would be quiet until he effected his purpose, and that, 
if he was dead, the cause would not die with him. He urged 
the Indians to move off to the Mississippi with him, and that 
there he would assemble his forces. All his arguments seemed 
to be bottomed on the prospect of hostilities against our peo- 
ple. He made no impression on the Shawanese, and went 
away much dissatisfied at their not coming into his views. I 
consider them among our best friends. I indirectly encour- 
aged their emigration westward, and told them that their 
annuity should follow them. They appear determined to re- 
main, and are much attached to the town and the improve- 
ments, which are considerable. 

I am very sorry that I was not here when Mr. O'Neille 
passed. I agree, from all the information I can collect, that 
the prophet is endeavoring to form a combination among the 
Indians hostile to us. I shall be on the alert, and will take 
special care to apprise you of everything that may be mate- 
rial, until the crisis passes away. The Indians, in any num- 
bers, you know, cannot subsist long in one place. We may, 
therefore, calculate on hearing of their dispersing soon, or 
doing something worse. Hendricks [a Delaware chief] writes 
that a deputation from White river is gone to the prophet, 
and he thinks it will have the desired effect. I hope to hear 
the result soon. If this incendiary is not silenced in an 
amicable manner, I think forbearance on our part is no longer 
prudent. It is not for me to say what steps ought to be taken ; 
but one thing is certain ; if he is not put down soon, some 
district of our country will receive a blow. The information 
contained in the enclosed paper, procured from my inter- 
preter's wife [Mrs. Abraham Ash], although it is in some 
respects improbable, taken in connection with the prophet's 
conduct, deserves some consideration. It is sent to you as 
we received it. There is no possible inducement with the 
woman to contrive a falsehood. 

I have read your communication on the subject of the In- 
dians going to the seat of government, and shall pay particu- 
lar attention to it. I have seen none of the chiefs since my 
return, but I learn that many of them intend coming in when 
they understand I am here. I have sent for the Turtle, but 
he is unwell. I believe no difficulties exist with the Miamis, 
on the subject of the treaty with the Kickapoos, except with 



 

the Turtle; and that originated, like all other mischiefs of 

the kind, with [Wells]. I will converse with the Turtle 

on the subject, and ascertain his objections. I do not ap- 
prehend much difficulty with him ; I have money to pay him 
[his annuity]. I will be answerable, that not another soul 

of the Miamis makes a single objection, if [Wells] lets 

them alone. I shall, in future, cherish the Mississinaway 
chiefs; for there is our strong hold. The Turtle is con- 
temptible, beyond description, in the eyes of the Indians. I 
shall not suffer him to go to the President, nor the Five 
Medals either. They have been there too often already. If 
the deputation goes at all, it must late in the season, as the 
President during the warm weather, will be at his seat in 
Virginia, and the secretary of war probably in Massachu- 
setts. I will have time enough to write you again on this 
subject. 

I think you will have to give up all idea of taking up 

[Wells] again. . He is too unprincipled to be employed any 
where, except as an interpreter, and under your own eye, 
where you might watch him. I could detail to you a thou- 
sand instances of his total disregard of every thing that is 
held sacred by honest and honorable men. Admitting he was 
restored here again (which in my opinion never can take 
place) he would be useless to you and the government; for 
the latter never would put any confidence in his representa- 
tions, and the public interest would thereby suffer. He has 
so long travelled in the crooked, miiy paths of intrigue and 
deception, that he never could be made to retrace his steps, 
and pursue a straight, fair, and honorable course, such as 
might be creditable to himself and useful to his country. My 
opinion of him is made up from a long residence at this post, 
and an intimate knowledge of his character, both public and 
private. I think I know him as well as any man can know 
him, and it is my decided opinion, that he will never suit 
your purposes here; and the sooner all hope of his re-estab- 
lishment is at an end, it will be the better; for he is becoming 
a pest here, and will move off if he finds he cannot be rein- 
stated. 

I have the honor to remain, with very great respect, your 
excellency's most obedient servant.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 26th June 1810 

Har. Pa. SOi-310 

Sir: 

Since my letter by the last mail was written a deputation 
of Potawatomies headed by the chief Winamac arrived here, 
being sent to inform me of the decision of a council lately held 
[at Parc-au-Vache] near St. Joseph of Lake Michigan which 
was attended by all the Lidians of that quarter and by the 
deputies of the Delaware Tribe; the object of whose mission I 
mentioned to you in my letter of the 15th ultimo. It appears 
that the last mentioned tribe have faithfully performed their 
duty to the United States and their promises to me. At the 
council above mentioned they made the most forcible repre- 
sentations against the schemes of the Prophet and succeeded 
entii-ely in detaching them from his interest. They do not 
deny their hostile intentions and acknowledge that they had 
received the Tomahawk but that they had bury'd it on the 
28th ultimo never more to be taken up. Winamac was also 
directed to inform me of all they knew of the Prophets plan. 
Detroit, Fort Wayne Chicago, St. Louis and this place were 
to have been surprised and every exertion made to engage all 
the Tribes upon the Mississippi to join in the confederacy. I 
cannot hear that any principal chiefs of the Fotawatomies 
(sachems or village chiefs) have given any countenance to the 
Prophet — his supporters are generally confined (amongst all 
the Tribes) to the war chiefs, or those who are heads of small 
bands. I cannot Sir give you a better idea of the character 
of this man (the Prophet) than the following anecdote will 
convey, and which I am assured by Winamac is strictly true. 
He proposed not long since to the young men to murder the 
principal chiefs of all the Tribes, observing that their hands 
would never be united, until this was effected ; that these were 
the men who sold their lands, and who would prevent them 
from opposing the encroachments of the white people. I am 
at a loss which most to admire the consummate villany of the 
scheme or its extreme artfulness. If a few of the old chiefs 
such as the Pi'ophet could select were taken from each Tribe, 
the rest could easily be persuaded to undertake any enterprise 
which that consummate scoundrel could suggest. An Iowa 
Indian (now here) informs me that two years ago this sum- 



 

mer, an agent from the British, arrived at the Prophets Town 
and in his presence delivered the message, with which he was 
charged — the substance of it was to urge the Prophet to unite 
as many Tribes as he could, against the United States, but not 
to commence hostilities, until they gave the signal — from this 
man and others of his nation, I learn that the Prophet has been 
constantly soliciting their own and others Tribes of the Mis- 
sissippi to join him against the United States. He repre- 
sented to them, that the white peoples had been constantly 
encroaching upon the Indians, continually driving them back 
that those who had suffered most were determined to make 
a stand and go no farther, and that the distant tribes who 
had not yet lost their lands, ought to assist those who had, or 
they would shortly experience a similar fate — that he was 
commissioned by the Great Spirit of the Indians (who was 
himself an Indian and different from the Great Spirit of the 
Whites) to tell them this and to tell them, that he would de- 
stroy them unless they listened to him. Winamac passed 
through the Prophets Town, on his way hither ; the latter was 
very much enraged at the decision of the council near St. 
Josephs and made an attempt to get Winamac assassinated — 
he declared too that altho' he was abandoned by so many of 
his followers, he had still enough left to carry his designs into 
execution, but that it would take a longer time to effect them. 
I have dispatch'd Col. [Francis] Vigo to the Miamis and a 
Mr. [Touissant] Dubois another french gentleman to the 
Prophet — the latter will I expect with his usual address deny 
all hostile intentions. His declaration to Winamac I take to 
be one of those ebullitions of passion in which I know he fre- 
quently indulges himself. Winamac says that he will now 
endeavour to raise the southern Indians, the Choctaws and 
Creeks, particularly (the Prophet's mother was a Creek) , and 
so strong does he suppose his grounds for this opinion to be, 
that he has declared that if the Prophet does not go to south- 
ward sometime this summer, that I may then consider him 
(Winamac) as a man of no truth. I was Sir for a long time 
unable to persuade myself that there was any probability of a 
war between the United States and the Indian Tribes on this 
frontier. I supposed that the latter had suffer'd too severely 
in their former attempts, to be again willing to measure their 
strength with a people, whose numbers were so immensely su- 



 

perior to their own and who had it in their power to deprive 
them of the supply of arms and ammunition, and of many 
other articles, which habit had render'd in a great measure 
necessary. I am now however perfectly convinced that war 
was not only thought of, but that it would have been actually 
commenced, but for the active interposition of the Delaware 
Tribe, which having suffer'd more than any other in the for- 
mer wars, were better able to appreciate the evils that a re- 
commencement of hostilities will bring upon them. (I have as 
little doubt that the scheme originated with the British and 
that the Prophet is inspired by the superintendent of Indian 
affairs for upper Canada, rather than the Great Spirit, from 
whom he pretends to derive his authority.) I do not however 
believe that it was their intention that the Indians should com- 
mence hostilities, but in the event of war between their nation 
and the United States. But it is probable that having given 
the impulse, they have found it difficult to regulate the after 
movements of their tawny allies. However desperate might 
be the circumstances under which the Indians would com- 
mence a war with the United States, history abounds with in- 
stances of its being undertaken under auspices even more sin- 
ister and untoward. I have before had the honour to inform 
you that the Indians of this country were certainly more 
miserable than they have ever been from the difficulty of pro- 
curing provisions, that they are in fact half starved. Is it 
surprising that they should view their own situation with dis- 
content, and ours with envy and jealousy, and that this should 
ripen into hatred. The Prophet has told them that the Great 
Spirit did not mean that the white and red people should live 
near each other, that the former poison'd the land and pre- 
vented it from producing the things necessary for their sub- 
sistance. Under that circumstance and by such artifices, sav- 
ages may be induced to adopt any measures however desperate 
which promises to better their conditions. The situation of 
the Delawares and Miamis is rather better than that of other 
tribes. 

Capt. [Thornton] Posey has not arrived but every moment 
expected, as he was near the mouth of the Wabash, more than 
a week ago, I shall for the present recommend his taking 
possession of the old Garrison and rendering it defensible by 
the erection of a blockhouse of rough timber and three lines of 
pickets, with the most convenient timber. These improve- 



 

ments will cost little, besides the labour of the men, there 
being now at the Garrison a waggon and two oxen. 

The two companies of Militia, which I have order'd out were 
muster'd on the 25th Inst and are now in this place. An En- 
sign of 16 men will march today for Busseron, the upper 
settlement of this country. I do not calculate on keeping these 
men in service longer than the return of Mr. Dubois unless the 
accounts brought by him should be very different from what I 
expect them to be. The report of this favourable change in 
the disposition of some the tribes being entirely derived from 
Indians I do not think it proper to release any military prepa- 
ration until it is confirmed by other evidence. 

I have the Honour to be with the greatest respect Sir yr.

Indiana Territory ^"''- ^"- ■^"' ■^^'' 

Knox County. Set. 

Before the undersigned a Justice of the Peace in and for 
said County personally came Captain Michal Brouillette who 
being first duly sworn on the Holy Evangelist of Almighty 
God deposeth and saith that agreeably to the instructions of 
the Governor he has remained at the Prophets Town since 
about the 12th May last [1809] until the 26th of this instant 
[June 26, 1810] that in that time there were almost daily coun- 
cils held, the proceedings of which' were kept as secret as pos- 
sible. That his friends amongst the Indians frequently in- 
formed him that the Prophet was not friendly to the United 
States and particularly that he was very much exasperated 
at the cession of Lands made last winter. That they had 
agreed that the Tract on the N. west side of the Wabash 
should not be surveyed. That a Potawatomie Chief [Wina- 
mac] who was very friendly to the United States told him 
that the Prophet certainly intended to make a stroke on the 
white people and when asked where he intended to strike he 
pointed towards Vincennes. That several of the Indians have 
expressed a wish that the French people should separate from 



 

the Americans at Vincennes and settle on the opposite bank of 
the Wabash. That the affairs of the Prophet received a great 
shock at the decision of the council held the latter end of last 
month at Park a Vach' near St. Josephs of Lake Michigan 
where the tribes that were assembled unanimously agreed not 
to go to war with the United States. That another deputa- 
tion arrived from the Delaware Tribe on the 23d of this in- 
stant with a long speech to the Prophet calculated to deter 
him from going to war, That the Prophet was much exasper- 
ated at it and told him (Brouillette) that the speech was made 
by that bad man at Vincennes meaning Gov. Harrison, That 
he is satisfied the Prophet has constant intercourse with some 
person or persons in or at or about Vincennes as he knows 
everything almost that transpires. He knew what informa- 
tion the Governor had received from the wife of [Abraham] 
Ash the Interpreter at Fort Wayne since the defection of so 
many of his followers he now denies that his hostility was 
against the United States but attributes his being charged 
with it to the Governor. He threatened to challenge him to 
fight him in single combat and that he will go on to the seat 
of government to get him removed. This deponant thinks 
that those Ideas must have been put into his head by some 
white man ; He further says that the account of the Prophets 
having 3000 men under his controul which he sent to the Gov- 
ernor was received from the Prophet himself and probably 
exaggerated, that he does not suppose that he now has more 
than 650 warriors. That he sincerely believes that the hostile 
disposition of the Prophet is to the United States has not been 
abandoned but that he does not think he will go to war unless 
he can prevail on the tribes which have fallen off from him 
again to unite. That the principal obsticle to this is the Pota- 
watomie chief Winimac and the Delaware Tribe that the for- 
mer is in great danger of being assassinated for his attach- 
ment to the United States. That he is incessantly travelling 
round amongst the Indians to keep them quiet. That the 
Prophets people are all well armed but he thinks they were 
deficient in ammunition. / jx

Sir: 

Mr. [Michael] Brouillette arrived here from the Prophets 
town on the 1st Instant and Mr. [Touissant] Dubois yester- 
day. I have the honor to enclose you a copy of the dsposition 
of the former. [See June 30, 1810, supra] Mr. Dubois was 
received by the Prophet with much apparent satisfaction. He 
told him that he had been sent by me to know what was the 
reason of his hostile preparations and enmity to the United 
States, that his conduct had excited so much alarm that the 
warriors both here and in Kentucky were preparing them- 
selves for service and that a detachment of Regular Troops 
were actually on their way to Vincennes, but that he was di- 
rected to tell him that these preparations were only intended 
for defence and that no attempt whatever would be made 

1. Dr. Jacob Kuy Kendall was of a Dutch family widely represented in the early 
history of the Ohio valley. Jacob Kuykendall was recommended by Harrison for the 
Leffislative council in 1805, and later held various appointive offices. The name soon 
came to be written Kuykendall. 



 

against him until his disposition to commit hostilities could 
no longer be doubted. The Prophet denies most strenuously 
that he intended to go to war with the white people and inti- 
mated that the Delawares and other Indians had been bribed 
with whisky by me to accuse him. That it was by the ex- 
press order of the Great Spirit that he had fixed himself there 
and that he was likewise ordered to assemble as many Indians 
as he could collect at that spot. When pressed by Mr. Dubois 
to state the grounds of his complaint if he had any against the 
United States he said that the Indians had been cheated of 
their lands and that no sale was good unless made by all the 
Tribes. He was told that the Government would listen to any 
statement he would make that it would be as well for him per- 
haps to go to Vincennes and see the Governor. This, how- 
ever, was declined alledging that he had been ill treated when 
there before.' 

Mr. Dubois found at the Prophets Town some old friends of 
his of the late Kickapoo Tribe with whom he had much con- 
versation. They appeared to him to be alarmed and to regret 
their having joined the Prophet. He asked them whether the 
Prophet really had a disposition to go to War with the United 
States. They said that they had long known that War was 
his intention but they were never informed whether he de- 
signed to attack the United States or the Osage nation. Mr. 
Dubois passed through the Wea and part of the Eel river 
Tribes. They were all under the impression that there would 
be a war and were apprehensive that they might be involved 
in it. Mr. Dubois however agrees with me in opinion that at 
present there is no danger, the defection of the Chippeawas 
and Ottawas and Potawatomies at the Council held at the 
Parke a Vache has for the present entirely frustrated the 
Prophet's designs. He fliinks too as Mr. Brouillette that the 
Chief Winemac will be assassinated by the Prophet partly for 
the active part he has taken against them. However painful 
it may be to entertain such an opinion I am nevertheless con- 
vinced of the fact that there is a constant communication be- 
tween some persons in this place and the Prophet and altho 
they may not have urged him to make war upon the United 
States they foment his discontent and encourage him to set

up pretentions which the policy of our Government has al- 
ways opposed and which never can be admitted without shut- 
ting the door to every future extinguishment of Title upon 
any terms that would be beneficial to our Treasury. The sub- 
ject of allowing the Indians of this country to consider all 
their lands as common property has been frequently and 
largely discussed in my communications with your predecessor 
and in a personal correspondence with the late President. The 
Treaties made by me last fall were concluded upon principles 
as liberal towards the Indians as my knowledge of the views 
and opinions of the Government would allow. For altho great 
latitude of discretion has always been given me I knew that 
the opinion of Mr. Jefferson on the subject went so far as to 
assert a claim of the United States lands paramount to all 
extinguished or decayed Tribes to the exclusion of all recent 
settlers. Upon this principle the Miami nation are the only 
rightful claimants of all the unpurchased lands from the Ohio 
to the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers. But Sir the President 
may rest assured that the complaints of injury with regard to 
the sale of lands is a mere pretence suggested to the Prophet 
by British partisans and emisaries. The parties to the late 
Treaty were never better satisfied than they are at this mo- 
ment, with the exception of the Kickapoos. Mr. Dubois thinks 
that they really repent of having made sale of the small tract 
above the mouth of Raccoon Creek and that a relinquishment 
of it would tend to alienate them from the Prophet. This is 
a step which I have informed him will never be taken by the 
Government — but there may be great propriety in suffering 
them to occupy it for some years. On this subject and some 
others which I deem important, I shall do myself the honor 
to make you a further communication by the next mail. 

Captain [Thornton] Posey has not yet arrived; as soon as 
he comes I shall dismiss the two companies of Militia.

His Excellcy. Govr. HARRISON. Sir ; 

I have the honor to acknowledge the Receipt of your Excel- 
lency's Letter of the 26th June by which it appears that the 
celebrated Personage, "the Prophet", will not be able to excite 
the Indians to acts of Hostility against the United States. 

Captain [Joseph] Cross, who had orders to halt at Newport, 
Kentucky & to await your orders in case of emergency, will 
now be directed to proceed on his route to St. Louis as orig- 
inally instructed. The Company under Capt. [Thornton] 
Posey, will remain at Vincennes until further orders. 

I am, &c. &c. &c. 



 

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 11th July 1810 

Har. Pa. 317-321 

Sm: 

Since I had the honor to write you on the 4th Inst. I have 
received a letter from Mr. [John] Johnston the Indian agent 
at Fort Wayne containing infoi'mation on the subject of the 
hostile combination of Indians against the United States 
which agrees almost in every particular with that which I 
had received at this place. Confonnably to his instructions 
I presume that Mr. Johnston has transmitted to you a dupli- 
cate of his communication to me. 

I fear however that I shall soon have to announce to you 
proofs of the hostility of the Prophet and his followers which 
will be more convincing than all that has been hitherto for- 
warded, even if that which I am now about to relate should 
not be so considered. 

On this day week four canoes passed the Wea village of 
Terre Haute, with four or five men in each, of the Prophets 
followers were supposed to be coming here. A Wea chief 
who came down by land gave me this information. Satur- 
day hearing nothing of them in the course of that day I dis- 
patched a Lieut, of Militia and eight men to see what had 
become of them. At a settlement about sixteen miles above 
this [Shakertown] they learned that one canoe only had come 
down as low as that with four Kickapoos. That they had 
left their canoe there and had gone to the meeting of the 
Shakers on Sunday. They returned late in the evening of 
that day and proceeded up the Wabash about one half mile 
where they left their canoe cut a hole in her and in the night 
stole five horses. Those fellows were all completely armed 
had no skins to trade with nor did they profess to have any 
other business than to visit the Shakers. That they were 
spies from the larger party I have not the least doubt and 
the manner in which the horses were stolen is the strongest 
indication of a hostile disposition that they have yet discov- 
ered — far from wishing to disguise it their canoe paddles and 
a small fish gig were left on the shoi-e within a short distance 
of the place from whence the horses were taken ; four or five 
days before three other horses were taken from the same 
place. 



 

The people in the neighborhood from whence the horses 
were taken are so much alarmed that they have collected to- 
gether for their defence. I have forbad their pursuit of the 
thieves because I know that it will produce bloodshed. In- 
deed from the little pains which was taken to conceal the 
tracks of the horses I am convinced that pursuit was de- 
sired by the Indians and that a larger party was lying in 
ambush at some distance. I was informed some considerable 
time ago that this was one of the methods they intended to 
take to bring on the War. ice. to send parties to steal horses 
and if they were pursued to kill the persons. As long how- 
ever as no blood is spilt I shall have hopes of bringing the 
Prophet to reason. But our people will not suffer their property 
to be taken and I daily expect to hear of some Indians being 
killed in an attempt to take off horses nor will this be the 
most disagreeable circumstance attending those depredations. 
I fear that some of the friendly Indians will suffer from the 
crimes of others. Indeed so difficult would it be to distinguish 
the tribes and so little pains will be taken by our people to 
do it that I have no other expectation than that of seeing all 
the Tribes united against us in six months after hostilities 
shall have commenced. I fear too that the Prophet or his 
friends may have discovered this mode of accomplishing his 
object. I expect the return of Col. [Francis] Vigo in a few 
days and by him some important information. Captain 
[Thornton] Posey arrived here on the 5th and he is now 
commencing the block house and lines of pickets which I have 
recommended him to erect. On Monday the two companies 
of Militia were dismissed. I am far from thinking that their 
services were no longer necessary but a great proportion of 
them being farmers and this the season of harvest they could 
not remain longer from home without loosing great part of 
their grain. 

I have the Honor to be most respectfully Sir 
Your Humble Servt.

Sirs: 

Col. [Francis] Vigo returned from his mission to the Mi- 
amies on the 14th Inst. He was charged with a double object 
of ascertaining the fidelity of that Tribe and to procure their 
consent to the conditional cession made by the Kickapoos to 
the land between the northwesterly extension of the line pass- 
ing through the mouth of Raccoon creek and the Vermilion 
river. They didn't give a final and positive answer to the 
proposition on the latter subject, but both the Col. and Mr. 
[John] Johnson are of opinion that the council which they 
are about to hold upon it will result in a decision such as 
we could wish. I observe that Congress have appropriated 
absolutely the annuity for this additional tract, when the 
cession was contingent only, depending upon the consent of 
the Miamis. 

The Miami Cheifs are supposed by Mr. Johnson and Col. 
Vigo to have preserved their fidelity to the United States — 
one only excepted — a very artful and sensible fellow, who 
(as a principal chief told Col. Vigo) had entered into all the 
views of the Prophet and even that of murdering all those 
who should stand in opposition to his measures — I shall dis- 
patch my Interpreter tomorrow [see next infrci] with a 
speech to the Prophet in which I shall propose to him to make 
a visit to the President with tw^o or three of his principal 
men. If he agrees to this, it is probable that the knowledge 
which he will acquire of the strength and resources of the 
United States will prevent him in future from attempting 
hostilities against us — and at any rate it will afl'ord an op- 
portunity for the government to become better acquainted 
with his character than it could derive from any description 
from others. 

From the lowas, who are still here, notwithstanding my 
endeavours to get rid of them, I have by some management 
drawn the information that the Sacs and Foxes have actually 
received the Tomahawk and were ready to strike whenever 
the prophet should give the signal. A considerable number 
of Sacs went some time since to see the British superin- 
tendent and on the 1st inst. 50 more passed Chicago for the 



 

same destination. A Miami chief who has just returned from 
his annual visit to Maiden, after having received the accus- 
tomed donation of goods, was thus addressed by [Matthew] 
Elliot' the British agent — "My son keep your eyes fixed on 
me — my tomhawk is now up — be you ready — but do not strike 
untill I give the signal." No horses have been stolen, that 
I hear of since my last but a man crossing the Wabash about 
20 miles above this was shot at twice by a party of Creeks 
and Shawanees he does not believe they had any idea of 
killing him but that it was only intended as an insult. 
I have the honor to be with great consideration : Sir 
Your Humble Servt. 

William Henry Harrison 

P. S. I have reason to believe that the desertion of the 
Wyandots mentioned by me some time since is only partial 
at any rate that it is confined to those of Sandusky the chief 
and party now with the Prophet are from the latter place.

July 19, 1810 

Har. Pa. 342-3A3 

Notwithstanding the improper language you have used 
towards me I will again endeavour to open your eyes to your 
true interests. Notwithstanding what bad white men have 
told you I am not your personal enemy you ought to know 
this from the manner I received and treated you on your first 
visit to this place. 

Altho I must say that I believe you are an enemy to the 17 
fires and that you have used the greatest exertions with other 
Tribes to lead them astray and in this you have in some 
measure succeeded as I hear they are ready to raise the Toma- 
hawk against their Father. 

Their father, notwithstanding his anger at their folly, is 
full of goodness and is ready to receive into his arms those 
of his Children who are willing to repent and acknowledge 
their fault and ask for his forgiveness. 

1. Matthew Elliott was born in Ireland but was an Indian trader out of Pitts- 
burg when the Revolution broke out. With his companions the Girty's McKee and 
others became British partisans and as such hated more than Indians by the Americans. 



 

There is yet but very little harm done but what may easily 
be repaired. The chain of friendship which unites the whites 
with the Indians may be received and be as strong as ever — 
a great deal of that work depends upon you — the destiny of 
those who are under your direction depends upon the choice 
which you will make of the two roads which are before you. 
One is lai-ge, open and pleasant, and leads to peace security and 
happiness — the other on the contrary is narrow and crooked, 
and leads to misery, to ruin. Do not deceive yourself, do not 
believe that all the Indians united are able to resist the force 
of the 17 fires even for a Moon. 

I know your Warriors are brave, ours are not less so, but 
what can a few brave Warriors do against the innumerable 
Warriors of the 17 fires. Our blue coats are more numerous 
than you can count, and our hunting shirts are like the leaves 
of the forests or the grains of sands on the Wabash. Do not 
think that the red coats can protect you, they are not able to 
protect themselves, they do not think of going to war with 
us, if they did in a few moons you would see our flags wave 
on all the Forts of Canada. 

What reason have you to complain of the 17 fires, have thoy 
taken anything from you, have they ever violated the Treaties 
made with the red men, you say they purchased land from 
those who had no right to sell. Show the truth of this and 
the lands will instantly be restored. Show us the rightful 
owners of these lands which have been purchased. Let them 
present themselves. The Ears of your father will be open to 
their complaints and if lands have been purchased of those, 
who did not own them they will be restored to the rightful 
owners. I have full power to arrange this business. But if 
you would rather carry your complaints before your great 
Father you shall be indulged. I vdll instantly take the means 
to send you to the city where your father lives with three 
chiefs which you will choose — everything necessary shall be 
prepared for j^our journey and means taken to ensure your 
safe return.^

A few weeks ago the post-rider, on his way from Vin- 
cennes to this place, was killed, and the mail lost; since that 
time we have had no communication with Vincennes. A part 
of the Sacs, and the greatest part of the Kickapoos, who re- 
side east of the Mississippi, have been absent some time on 
a visit to the Indian Prophet. One hundred and fifty Sacs are 
on a visit to the British agent, by invitation, and a smaller 
party on a visit to the island of St. Joseph, in Lake Huron. 
(Extract) 

Wm. Clark 

Harrison to Secretary of War 

Vincennes July 25th 1810 

Sir: Har. Pa. ,25-^,1 

I had the honor last evening to receive your favors of the 
3d 5th and 7th instant. 

From the last advices from the Indian country I learn that 
the chiefs of the Potawatimies who are friendly to us, are 
actively employed in forming a combination to disperse the 
banditti, which the Prophet has collected at Tippecanoe. They 
inform me that the Delawares, Miamis, and part of the Otta- 
was, Chippewas, and Potawatimis will unite for this purpose. 
Indeed I am told, by some young Potawatimis, who arrived 
here since my last that the Winebagos (who form the 
Prophet's principal strength) have been already warned to 
depart and that they had agreed to go, as soon as their corn is 
ripe. I received a few days ago a speech from the Delawares, 

before the Prophet, at the distance of ten or twelve feet from him. "He loolced at me", 
said Barron, "for several minutes, without speal<ing or malting any sign of recognition, 
although he knew me well. At last he spoke, apparently in anger, 'For what purpose 
do you come here?' said he. 'Brouillette was here: he was a spy, Dubois was here: 
he was a spy. Now you have come. You, too, are a spy. There is you grave ! — look 
on it.* The Prophet then painted to the ground near the spot where I stood," Tecumseh, 
at this moment, came out from one of the Indian loflges. He spoke to Mr, Barron 
in a cold, formal manner : told him that his life was in no danger, and requested him 
to state the object of his visit to the Prophet's Town. The contents of the letter of 
Governor Harrison weie then communicated to the Prophet. Mr, Barron received no 
definite answer to this letter, but he was told that Tecumseh would, in the course of a 
few days, visit Vincennes for the purpose of holding an interview with the governor." 

Dillon, Indiana, iit-S

in which they inform me "that they were determined to put 
out the Prophet's fire this fall". This scoundrel does not ap- 
pear however to be intimidated but is as actively employed 
in poisoning the minds of the Indians as ever. On Saturday 
last two of his people arrived here, one of them his principal 
counseller. In the conference which I had with them, they 
attributed a disposition to go to war with the United States 
to the wai-riors alone. The Chiefs they said had never as- 
sented to it. But they insisted upon their right to collect as 
many Indians as they could get together upon the Wabash it 
being in obedience to the express orders of the Great Spirit. 
A young Iowa Chief has remained here after the departure of 
those of his nation mentioned in my former letters, with him, 
these Shawnees have had frequent conversations in which they 
discovered the most implacable enmity to the United States. 
The encroachment of the Whites upon their lands was still 
the burden of their song. Governor [Ninian] Edwards 
writes me that the Kaskaskias Indians were invited to the 
Prophet's congress and were informed that the object was to 
consult upon the subject of recovering their lands. 

I am confident that all the Prophet's schemes for forming 
a general confederacy against the United States are for the 
present blasted, and I do not apprehend any further injury to 
the settlements during the present summer, but that of steal- 
ing horses. If the Winebagos return to their own country, 
I think it probable that they will attempt to indemnify them- 
selves for their disappointment by taking all the horses within 
their reach. 

I shall write by this Mail to Capt. [Joseph] Cross to remain 
at Newport until he receives your further instructions. This 
is done not from any belief that his detachment could not be 
more usefully employed upon the Wabash, than at Bellefon- 
taine, but from an unwillingness to draw them so far from the 
route of their original destination, until you should have an 
opportunity of determining, upon that which I have the honor 
of now, submitting to you. Admitting that the designs of the 
Prophet are for the present rendered abortive there can be 
no doubt but that his disposition and that of the British agent 
of Indian affairs [Matthew Elliott] to do us injury remains 
the same. The latter is a tory refugee from the neighbour- 
hood of Pittsburgh whose implacable enmity to his native 
country prompted him to take part with the Indians in the 



 

battle between them and General Wayne's army. He has ever 
since his appointment to the principal agency, used his utmost 
endeavours to encourage amongst the Indians a spirit of hos- 
tility to all our views, and the lavish hand with which he is 
allowed to scatter his presents amongst them, shows that his 
government participates in his enmity and authorizes his 
measures. The principal part of these presents are given to 
the Miamis, Delaware, Shawnees, Potawatimies, Kickapoos, 
Chippewas, Ottawas, and Wyandots, and I calculate that they 
exceed in value all the Peltries collected by the British Trad- 
ers from the country inhabited by those Tribes. It cannot 
be then for commercial views, that these goods are given. 
But from a desire to retain in their influence the most warlike 
of the Tribes, as a kind of barrier to Canada. So true is this, 
that the movements of the British agents amongst the Indians, 
is to me a kind of political Thermometer, by which I can ascer- 
tain to a great degree of certainty the existence of any new 
cause of apprehension from a visitation against us in the 
cabinet of St. James. 

As the best and cheapest mode of controling the Tribes who 
were most exposed to the intrigues of the British, the late 
President adopted the plan of forming a strong settlement on 
this side of the Ohio. It was for this purpose, that the ex- 
tinguishment of the Indian Tribe was pushed to the extent it 
has been, having it also in view, so to curtail their hunting 
grounds as to force them to change their mode of life and 
thereby to render them less warlike and entirely dependent 
upon us, or to remove to the West side of the Mississippi. 
This contemplated page of their future history has nof how- 
ever, been so secretly kept as to escape their own or the 
sagacity of their British friends. And hence the opposition 
which has been made by the latter to every treaty and the bold 
stroke of collecting the remote tribes upon the Wabash for 
the purpose of forming a conferacy strong enough either to 
make open war upon us or by frequent alarms to prevent the 
progress of our settlements. If the first part of the plan has 
been defeat the latter has been more successful nor is there 
any certainty that the former will not be renewed as soon as 
a favorable opportunity presents itself. In stability and 
fickleness are the characteristics of the Indians, and the inat- 
tention which the great bulk of them pay to remote conse- 
quences, is truly surprising. The convenience or safety of the 



 

passing moment is all they regard. If they were certain that 
by undertaking a war they would at first be successful that 
they would take a great many scalps a great deal of plunder 
it would be in vain to predict future defeat and misfortune. 
With such dispositions it is impossible to count upon the 
friendships of those who are not bound to us by the tie of in- 
terest in any other way than by holding the rod of correction 
constantly over them. You may rely upon it, Sir, that it was 
the fear of being involved in the correction which they saw 
preparing for the Prophet that has given life to the zeal which 
some of the tribes now manifest against him. The bustle 
amongst the Militia here, the Reviews and frequent musters 
which I caused to be made, the arival of Capt. [Thornton] 
Posey's company and the report which I had circulated that 
the Militia of Ohio and Kentucky were also preparing them- 
selves produced a most beneficial eff'ect and supported my rep- 
resentations with the best of all possible arguments which can 
be used to a savage. The alarm however, has done us mate- 
rial injury. A few of the frontier settlers have fled and the 
emigration to this part of the country almost entirely sus- 
pended. It is for the purpose of reassuring those who de- 
signed to purchase the public lands in this Territory and pai'- 
ticularly for forming an extensive settlement upon the newly 
acquired purchase that I take the liberty of recommending the 
establishment of one or two strong posts upon the Wabash 
within the limits of that purchase. I do not think it would be 
prudent to expose a single company immediately in the vicin- 
ity of so large a body of Indians, and it is for this service that 
I suppose Captain [Joseph] Cross could be more usefully em- 
ployed than at Belle-fontaine. The occupancy of some point 
or points upon the Wabash above this by our troops would I 
am persuaded sensibly affect the sales of the public lands in 
all the three districts of Cincinnati, Jeffersonville and Vin- 
cennes and would be a cause of bringing into the Treasury 
more money than would pay the expences of the establish- 
ments. As a military position for restraining the Indians it 
also, in my opinion, would be of considerable importance. As 
far as a post can controul Indians it would have that effect 
upon a majority of those warlike Tribes enumerated above 
and these will always govern those on the Mississippi who are 
more ignorant less warlike and worse armed. 

If this measure should be adopted by the President and 



 

Capt. Corss's detachment ordered on this service I would rec- 
ommend that they be also accompanied by one or two com- 
panies of mounted infantry. The mail being about to close, 
I can only add that I am with great respect Sir, 
Yr. Humble Servt.

Sir: 

[Joseph] Barron the Interpreter has not yet returned from his 
mission to the Prophet nor have I heard anything from that 
quarter since my last. I have however received information 
from another direction of a very unpleasant nature. A num- 
ber of the inhabitants of the northern frontier of the Jeffer- 
sonville district have been driven off by the Indians and much 
of their property destroyed. They commenced their depreda- 
tions on the cattle and hogs of the settlers upon the Embarras 
fork of white river and threatened to kill the people unless 
they instantly moved off. This information was first com- 
municated to me on Thursday last, it has since been reiterated 
by letters and travellers from that quarter. The accounts 
were however so vague that I determined to dispatch a person 
upon whom I could rely to know the truth of the matter and 
find out to what tribes the Indians belong that have done 
the injury. For this purpose a militia officer of rank [Col. 
Ephraim Jourdan] and information set out yesterday accom- 



 

panied by [Michael] Brouillette the Interpreter. One of the 
letters I have received informs me that the hostile party con- 
sists of about 150 Potawatomies Miamis and Shaw^nees. Some 
Delawares were in the neighbourhood who behaved in a 
friendly manner to the settlers and advised them to be upon 
their guard. I do not believe that there are any Miamis with 
this band of depredators. I think it most probable that they 
are Kickapoos, Potawatomies and Shawanees and that they 
are sent to that quarter by the Prophet for the purpose of in- 
volving the Delawares in the quarrel with us. That country 
is the usual hunting ground of the latter tribe, and it is quite 
probable that our people may be so enraged at the loss of their 
property as to fall upon any Indians they may meet with. A 
Delaware Indian told a gentleman between this and Louisville 
a few days ago that he was convinced that this was the object 
of the Prophet. Capt. [G. R. C] Floyd arrived last night. 
I have not seen him, but he informed a gentleman of my fam- 
ily that the alarm extended as far south as Blue River, and 
that the people were flying towards the Ohio from every di- 
rection. In this quarter several horses have been stolen within 
the last ten days, and I am told that the Indians manifest 
much more insolence than usual to the citizens in the coun- 
try. Your letter of the 14th ultimo, I had the honor to re- 
ceive last evening. I shall notwithstanding write immedi- 
ately to Capt. [Joseph] Cross, to request him to remain at 
NewPort untill your determination upon the proposition made 
in my last letter, and the information conveyed in this, shall 
be knovv-n, and should he have left New Port before the arrival 
of my letter I will request him to halt at Massac for your 
further orders. I am persuaded that a display of force in 
this quarter is at this time, more necessary than anywhere 
else and may perhaps prevent a war.

Harrison to Secretary of War — Petition 

Randolph, Illinois, Aug. 6, 1810 

Har. Pa. JJ8-JU 

Sir: 

The people inhabiting in the Prairie and adjoining thereto 
between the Big and Little Wabash have been very much fluc- 
tuated of late concerning- a talk of an Indian War, the accation 
of this disturbance was owing to the discourse of an old Muscoga 
Indian Named Peter who told a man living here (one Jesse 
Bowman) that the Shawonese Indians intended to go to war 
with the whites this Moon and advised Bowman to provide for 
the safety of his Family, and requested him to tell the same 
to some more people whom the old Indian had a friendship 
for. This Indian has lived about two years with the Whites 
and has got the confidence of most of the people ; he also said 
that Eleven Indian Tribes had or were going to join the 
Shawonese, the names we are unable to inform your Excel- 
lency; this discourse has so opperated on the Minds of the 
people that out of forty-two Families or more only Fifteen 
Families have determined to stay. Some of the remainder 
have moved, others making preparation to stay have proceeded 
to the erection of a Fort, what we request of your Excellency 
is to inform us by Mr. Wim. McHenry whether you think there 
is any such danger and should your Excellency have reason 
to fear there is, we shall feel grateful to be informed of the 
same, that we may be upon our Guard. We hope the Urgency 
of the case needs no Apollogy with your Excellency for the 
trouble we give you and beg leave to subscribe ourselves

The enclosed letter which I have this moment received 
shows that the knowledge of an attack upon our settlements 
about this time was pretty generally defined amongst the 
Indians. 



 

If the Prophet has really abandoned the scheme for the 
present he has not had time to communicate it to his distant 
allies for the Sacs have actually killed four of our citizens 
above the Missouri about 10 days ago. Mr. [Charles] Jouet 
[Indian agent at Chicago] informs me that the Sacs have been 
soliciting the Lake Indians to join them against the United 
States.

Sir: 

Mr. [Joseph] Barron returned on Thursday last. The 
speech (see July 19, 1810, supra) taken by him to the Prophet 
was intended to convince him of the folly of his attempt to 
make war upon the United States, to assure him if he had 
any just cause of complaint against us, that we were open 
to conviction, and as soon as we were sensible of it, redress 
would immediately follow, that we held it to be a correct 
principle, that a purchase of lands made from a party who 
were not themselves the owners conveyed no title to it, and 
that consequently it remained for him only to prove that we 
had made purchases of this sort, and the land so purchased 
would either be immediately given up or a proper equivalent 
made for it. That I had authority to adjust these matters 
but as he seemed to think that I was prejudiced against him, 
he might if he pleased make a visit to the President, and 
lay all his complaints before him. 

No particular answer was returned by Mr. Barron. It is 
to be brought by the brother of the Prophet who will be here 
in a few days. This brother is really the efficient man — the 
Moses of the family. I have not seen him since the treaty 
of Greenville and should not know him. He is however de- 
scribed by all as a bold, active, sensible man daring in the 
extreme and capable of any undertaking. Barron lodged 
with him and their con\orsation was protracted through the 
night, he denying having intended to make war; but de- 
clared most solemnly that it was not possible to remain 



 

friends with the United States, unless they would abandon 
the idea of extending their settlements further to the north 
and westward; and explicitly acknowledge the principle that 
all the lands in the western country was the common prop- 
erty of all the tribes. "The great spirit said he gave this 
great island to his red children. He placed the whites on 
the other side of the big water, they were not contented with 
their own, but came to take ours from us. They have driven 
us from the sea to the lakes, we can go no farther. They 
have taken upon themselves to say this tract belongs to the 
Miamis, this to the Delawares & so on. but the Great Spirit 
intended it as the common property of all the Tribes, nor 
can it be sold without the consent of all. Our father tells 
us that we have no business on the Wabash, the land belongs 
to other Tribes, but the great spirit order'd us to come here 
and we shall stay." He was however pleased with my speech. 
He had never been to see me. He only recollected me a very 
young man setting by the side of Genl. Wayne. He had not 
troubled the white people much but he would go now to Vin- 
cennes and convince me that I had listen'd to bad men, when 
I was told that they meditated war against the United States. 
From the conversation which [Joseph] Barron had with 
the Kickapoos and other Indians at the Prophet's town, he 
thinks that they are greatly displeased with him. They were 
really apprehensive of an attack and were greatly alarmed 
at the appearance of Barron, whom they supposed had been 
sent in advance of an approaching army, to see what situ- 
ation they were in. A Potawatomie chief [Winamac] told 
Barron in the presence of the Prophet, that he (the Prophet) 
had promised them that no man should die at his town; but 
that three Kickapoos had been buried in as many days. The 
Prophet imperfectly understanding his language, asked Bar- 
ron what he had said, upon his repeating it, the Prophet ob- 
served that the Potawatomies had lied, none had died ; I will 
not say (answered the chief with great indignation) that any 
have died but I know you promised that none should die and 
I have seen their bodies buried within three days, but they 
may be dogs, or persons who have long since died and been 
taken up to be buried over again. The Prophets brother [Te- 
cumseh] told Mr. Barron that he would bring with him about 
thirty of the principal men and as he knew that the young 
men were fond of attending on such occasions, that there 



 

would probably be one hundred in all ; but the prophet said 
that he might expect to see a great many more. Besides the 
expense which will be incurr'd by supporting such a number 
for 10 or 15 days it will not be very pleasant to have them 
here, from other considerations ; I therefore immediately dis- 
patch'd an Indian with a message to request that the chiefs 
only would come down, attended by a few of their young men. 
This day I have dispatched [Michael] Brouillet by water to 
inforce the necessity of their compliance. 

Col. [Ephraim] Jourdan whom I sent with Brouillet to 
know the cause of the alarm which I mentioned to have ex- 
isted amongst the settlers, upon the Embarras [Driftwood] 
fork of White river, returned last evening. The party which 
had insulted the white people were principally Creeks and 
straglers from other Tribes, the injury consisted in killing 
some hogs and cattle, taking some provisions by force out 
of some of the houses and threatening to scalp the men if 
they did not move off. Before Col. Jourdan arrived, the com- 
manding officer of the militia of Clark county had been over 
with fifty mounted riflemen for the purpose of protecting the 
settlements, or if necessary bringing off the inhabitants; he 
found that the marauding party had dispersed ; a few hunters 
of the Delawares remain'd in the neighborhood and these 
were so frighten'd by the appearance of the Militia and so 
completely spread the alarm, that Col. Jourdan was unable 
to discover an Indian, or the recent trace of one, for many 
miles round. Ten or twelve families had moved off but the 
rest had gotten over their fears and had sent to recall such 
of the runaways, as had not entirely left the Territory. 

A person who has been employ'd by the Surveyor General 
to run the boundary line of the new purchase informs me 
that he has been directed to proceed on that work immedi- 
ately and finish it by the first of September, by which time 
the surveyors who are to subdivide the tract, will be on the 
ground. 

This gentleman came to ask my opinion upon the pro- 
priety of commencing the survey, and I have advised him to 
make his preparations and wait the arrival of the Wea Chiefs 
whom I expect in a few days, and to whom, it will be proper 
to propose to send some of their Tribe to see that the survey 
is made agreeably to the treaty. This has been usual, as well 
as to pay the Indians who are so employ'd. 



 

I hope to be able to give you a compete view of Indian 
politics after the conference is terminated with the deputies 
from the Prophet and that it will be the last with which I 
shall trouble you for some time. In the mean time I beg 
leave to reiterate my recommendation of the posts upon the 
Wabash. Depend upon it Sir, the Treasury of the United 
States will be much benefited by that measure. The new pur- 
chase has been recently explored by persons from the two 
Carolinas who have given it a high character, and I am as- 
sured that a very large emigration from those states, may 
be expected immediately, if the dread of the Indians does not 
prevent them. 

I have the honor to be very respectfully your Servt.

Since writing you on the 25th ultimo, about one hundred 
Sawkeys [Sacs] have returned from the British agent, who 
supplied them liberally with everything they stood in want 
of. The party received forty-seven rifles and a number of 
fusils, with plenty of powder and lead. This is sending fire- 
brands into the Mississippi country, inasmuch as it will draw 
numbers of our Indians to the British side, in the hope of 
being treated with the same liberality.

Vincennes 22nd August 1810 

Har. Pa. 350-359 

Sir: 

If the information which I have heretofore given you on 
the subject of the designs of the Prophet and his followers 
has been vague and in some respects contradictory the con- 
sequence of my having derived it from various sources, not 



 

always the most intelligent, that which I have now the honor 
to communicate has at least the advantage of authenticity, 
coming from the brother of the Prophet who as I have before 
informed you is the great man of the party. This person- 
age, who is called Tecumseh, arrived here on the 12th Inst, 
and excepting the intervening Sunday and one bad day I 
have been constantly engaged with him untill the last even- 
ing. His speeches the two first days were sufficiently inso- 
lent and his pretensions arrogant, but that of Monday I en- 
close to you entire, as it was taken down by a Gentleman 
whom I employed for that purpose, and is as correct as could 
be expected, considering that the Interpreter speaks bad Eng- 
lish and is not very remarkable for clearness of intilect, al- 
though faithfull in the highest degree and for knowledge of 
the Indian languages unrivalled. The facts avowed by Te- 
cumseh in the broadest manner are: That it was the object 
of his brother and himself from the commencement to form 
a combination of all the Indian Tribes in this quarter to put 
a stop to the encroachments of the white people and to estab- 
lish a principle that the lands should be considered common 
property and none sold without the consent of all. that it 
was their intention to put to death all the chiefs who were 
parties to the late Treaty, and never more to suffer any vil- 
lage chiefs to manage the affairs of the Indians, but that 
everything should be put into the hands of the warriors. 
That the Americans had driven them from the sea coast, and 
would shortly if not stopped, push them into the Lakes, that 
they were determined to make a stand, where they were. He 
still however with strange inconsistency, asserted that it was 
not his intention to go to war, and that the persons who had 
given me that information were liars. On Winemac, who was 
present, he poured a torrent of abuse and threatened him in 
such a manner that he (Winemac) expecting personal vio- 
lence recharged his pistol and was prepared to stop the 
Shawonese insolence forever. Every instance of injustice and 
injury which have been committed by our citizens upon the 
Indians from the commencement of the revolutionary war 
(There are unfortunately too many of them) were brought 
forward and exagerated, and every thing said which was 
likely to inflame the minds of the Indians against us. When 
he finished his harangue, I began to answer him and was con- 
trasting the conduct of the United States towards the Indians 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 461 

with that of the other civilized powers, showing their uni- 
form regard to justice in their transactions with the most 
significant tribe, when he interrupted me before the inter- 
preter could explain what I had said to the Potawatomies 
and Miamis and with the most violent jesticulations and in- 
dications of anger began to contradict what I had said in the 
most indecent manner. When he first rose, a number of his 
party, also sprung up, arm'd with war clubs, tomhawks, and 
spears and stood in a threatening attitude. Not understand- 
ing his language I did not know what he had said, until the 
Interpreter explained it to me, but the Secretary of the Ter- 
ritory General Gibson, who speaks the Shawonese language, 
and was sitting near me, apprehending some violence, re- 
quested Lieut. [Jesse] Jennings^ to make a guard of 12 men, 
who were at a little distance to stand to their arms. The 
guard was brought up; and as soon as his speech was in- 
terpreted to me, I reproached him for his conduct and re- 
quired him instantly to depart to his camp, declaring that I 
was determined to extinguish the council fire, and no longer 
to have any communication with him, that my answer to that 
part of his speech which related to the lands lately pur- 
chased would be communicated to the Tribes, which he said 
he represented, in a written message, and if he had anything 
further to say to me, he must send the Huron or some other 
chief to me when the Interpreter visited him in the morning, 
he earnestly requested me to give him another interview and 
protested that he meant no harm by his conduct the day be- 
fore, and that he wished everything to be amicably settled. 
He also told Mr. [Joseph] Barron, that it was probable he 
had been deceived by white people, that he had been informed 
that the citizens here were equally divided, one half on my 
side, and the other on his ; one half opposed to the purchase 
of lands from the Indians, and the other, with me, determined 
to drive the Indians to extremities ; that he had been told that 
I purchased the lands against the consent of the Government 
and one half of the people, who in fact did not want the 
lands, as they already had more than they could occupy. This 
he knew to be true as he had sent some of hh men to recon- 
noitre the settlements and he found that the lands towards 
the Ohio were not settled at all. The information which was 



 

given him came I am convinced from a small factious party 
here headed by a scotch tory [William Mcintosh] who would 
not hesitate to adopt any measure that would be likely to do 
me an injury. Independent of his hatred to the American 
government and individually to myself he is very much in- 
terested to prevent the settling of the new purchase, as he 
is the owner of a large quantity of land, purchased for a 
song from the ignorant French. The person alluded to by 
Tecumseh as giving him the information from the Treaty of 
Fort Wayne is beyond all doubt Wells!! I have the honor 
to enclose a copy of the speech which I sent to the Prophet, 
to answer which his brother came here. In this I told him 
that if any Tribe could prove a better claim to the lands 
ceded by the late treaties than those who sold them had, that 
they would be immediately surrendered. No proof whatever 
has been adduced to show that any other Tribe but those 
who were parties to the Treaties have or ever had any right 
to the lands in question. The Tribes, which, he said, he rep- 
resents have never given their consent, but I cannot get him 
to attempt to show that their consent was necessary. He 
says however, that they are determined to fall upon the 
Tribes who sold the land if it is not given up — and at the 
conclusion of yesterday's council I asked him to tell me 
whether the person who was appointed to run the boundary 
line would receive any injury if he should proceed, his an- 
swer as you will observe was, that the old line must be the 
boundary. If I had Capt. [Joseph] Cross's detachment I 
would direct the surveyor to proceed in his work and send 
a subaltern's command to guard him. If he attempts it with- 
out I am satisfied he will be compelled to return and perhaps 
murdered. 

I have promised Tecumseh to send on the President his 
speech and to procure the President's answer and I should 
be glad to receive a speech signed by the President or your- 
self informing him that the land would not be given up. This 
will convince the Indians of the falsehood of the information 
they have received, that the government is willing to acknowl- 
edge the principles which the Shawonee wishes to establish 
and that I only am opposed to it. I have, by this mail writ- 
ten to Captain Cross to proceed immediately to this place with 
his detachment and in the mean time I have written to the 
surveyor General that his deputies cannot at present proceed 



S 

with their work without danger. I am far from believing 
that an Indian war is inevitable but I believe the avoiding 
it will depend upon our showing an ability to punish the first 
aggression. Pardon me for repeating what my long knowl- 
edge of the Indians, I am induced to believe is with them, 
almost a general rule, viz. never to let an opportunity pass 
of revenging the injuries they think they have received from 
the whites when it can be done with impunity. I receive so 
many different accounts, it is impossible to tell what is the 
strength of the Prophet's party — whether it is increasing or 
decreasing, notwithstanding the strong language of Tecum- 
seh, I believe in the latter. I believe also that the Delawares, 
Miamis and part of the Potawatomies will join to put him 
down and I rather suppose they will succeed. It will assist 
the cause greatly to let them see that we are ready to sup- 
port our rights with the sword. How shall the Regulars here 
and those that are to come be employed? Shall one or more 
forts be established as formerly proposed? Shall the sur- 
veyors be guarded? Shall militia mounted or dismounted be 
employed as auxiliaries and in what numbers? 

Your directions on these subjects as soon as convenient 
will oblige me. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir 
Your Humble Servt. 

WiLLM. Henry Harrison 

P. S. Seventy-five fellows of this neighborhood, well 
mounted, have formed themselves into a Dragoon Troop, but 
they have no arms and can get none. If the Government 
would furnish them they would be returned when called for. 
The proper equipment of this Troop would be to us of the 
greatest possible advantage. In the Prairie country seventy 
Dragoons would be equal to thrice this number of any other 
species of Troops. 
The Honble William Eustis, Secretary of War 

Tecumseh's Speech to Governor Harrison 20th August 
1810 

Brother I wish you to listen to me well — I wish to reply to 
you more explicity, as I think you do not clearly understand 
what I before said to you I shall explain it again. 



 

When we were first discover'd it was by the French who 
told us that they would adopt us as their children and gave 
us presents without asking anything in return but our con- 
sidering them as our fathers. Since we have changed our 
fathers we find it difi'erent. 

Brother. This is the manner that the treaty was made by 
us with the French. They gave us many presents and treated 
us well. They asked us for a small piece of country to live on 
which they were not to leave and continue to treat us as their 
children after some time the British and French came to 
quarrel the British were victorious yet the French promised 
to think of us as their child and if they ever could serve us to 
do it. Now my red children I know I was obliged to abandon 
you in disagreeable circumstances, but we have never ceased 
to look upon you and if we could now be of service to you we 
would still be your friends. 

The next father we found was the British who told us that 
they would now be our fathers and treat us in the same man- 
ner as our former fathers the French — they would occupy the 
same land they did and not trouble us on ours; but would look 
on us as their children. 

Brother. We were very glad to hear the British promise 
to treat us our fathers the French had done they began to 
treat us in the same way but at last they changed their good 
treatment by raising the Tomahawk against the Americans 
and put it into our hands, by which we have suffered the loss 
of a great many of our young men etc. 

Brother. Now we began to discover the treachery of the 
British they never troubled us for our lands but they have 
done worse by inducing us to go to war. The Hurons have 
particularly suffered during the war and have at length be- 
come certain of it. They have told us that we must bury the 
British Tomhawk entirely that if we did not they (the B.) 
would ere long ask us to take it up. 

You ought to know that after we agreed to bury the Tom- 
hawk at Greenvile we then found their new fathers in the 
Americans who told us they would treat us well, not like the 
British who gave us but a small piece of pork every day. I 
want now to remind you of the promises of the white people. 
You recollect that the time the Delawares lived near the white 
people (Americans) and satisfied with the promises of friend- 



 

ship and remained in security yet one of their town was sur- 
prised and the men women and children murdered. 

The same promises were given to the Shawonese flags, were 
given to them and were told by the Americans that they were 
now the children of the Americans. Their flags will be as 
security for you if the white people intend to do you harm 
Hold up your flags and no harm will be done you. This was 
at length practised and the consequence was that the person 
bearing the flag was murdered with others in their village. 
Know my Bro. after this conduct can you blame me for plac- 
ing little confidence in the promises of our fathers the 
Americans. 

Brother. Since the peace was made you have kill'd some 
of the Shawanese, Winebagoes Delawares and Miamies and 
you have taken our lands from us and I do not see how we 
can remain at peace with you if you continue to do so. You 
have given goods to the Kickapoos for the sale of their lands 
to you which has been the cause of many deaths amongst them. 
You have promised us assistance but I do not see that you 
have given us any. 

You try to force the red people to do some injury. It is 
you that is pushing them on to do mischief. You endeavour 
to make destructions, you wish to prevent the Indians to do 
as we wish them to unite and let them consider their land 
as the common property of the whole you take tribes aside 
and advise them not to come into this measure and untill our 
design is accomplished we do not wish to accept of your invi- 
tation to go and visit the President. 

The reason I tell you this is — You want by your distinctions 
of Indian tribes in allotting to each a particular track of land 
to make them to war with each other. You never see an In- 
dian come and endeavour to make the white people do so. 
You are continually driving the red people when at last you 
will drive them into the great lake where they can't either 
stand or work. 

Brother. You ought to know what you are doing with the 
Indians. Perhaps it is by direction of the President to make 
those distinctions. It is a very bad thing and we do not like 
it. Since my residence at Tippecanoe we have endeavoured 
to level all distinctions to destroy village chiefs by whom all 
mischief is done ; it is they who sell our land to the Americans 
our object is to let all our affairs be transacted by Warriors. 



 

Brother. This land that was sold and the goods that was 
given for it was only done by a few. The treaty was after- 
wards brought here and the Weas were induced to give their 
consent because of their small numbers. The treaty at Fort 
Wayne was made through the threats of Winamac but in 
future we are prepared to punish those chiefs who may come 
forward to propose to sell their land. If you continue to pur- 
chase of them it will produce war among the different tribes 
and at last I do not know what will be the consequence to the 
white people. 

Brother. I was glad to hear your speech you said if we 
could show that the land was sold by persons that had no right 
to sell you would restore it, that that did sell did not own it 
it was me. These tribes set up a claim but the tribes with 
me will not agree to their claim, if the land is not restored to 
us you will soon see when we return to our homes how it will 
be settled. We shall have a great council at which all the 
tribes shall be present when we will show to those who sold 
that they had no right to sell the claim they set up and we will 
know what will be done with those Chiefs that did sell the land 
to you. I am not alone in this determination it is the deter- 
mination of all the warriors and red people that listen to me. 

I now wish you to listen to me. If you do not it will appear 
as if you wished me to kill all the chiefs that sold you this 
land. I tell you so because I am authorised by all the tribes 
to do so. I am at the head of them all. I am a Warrior and 
all the Warriors will meet together in two or three moons from 
this. Then I will call for those chiefs that sold you the land 
and shall know what to do with them. If you do not restore 
the land you will have a hand in killing them. 

Brother. Do not believe that I came here to get presents 
from you if you offer us anything we will not take it. By 
taking goods from you you will hereafter say that with them 
you purchased another piece of land from us. If we want 
anything we are able to buy it, from your traders. Since the 
land was sold to you no traders come among us. I now wish 
you would clear all the roads and let the traders come among 
us. Then perhaps some of our young men will occasionally 
call upon you to get their guns repaired. This is all the as- 
sistance we ask of you. 

Brother. I should now be very glad to know immediately, 



 

what is your determination about the land also of the traders 
I have mentioned. 

Brother. It has been the object of both myself and brother 
from the beginning to prevent the lands being sold should you 
not return the land, it will occaion us to call a great council 
that will meet at the Huron Village where the council fire has 
already been lighted At which those who sold the land shall 
be call's and shall sufi'er for their conduct. 

Brother. I wish you would take pity on all the red people 
and do what I have requested. If you will not give up the land 
and do cross the boundary of your present settlement it will 
be very hard and produce great troubles among us. How can 
we have confidence in the white people when Jesus Christ came 
upon the earth you kill'd and nail'd him on a cross, you thought 
he was dead but you were mistaken. You have shaken among 
you and you laugh and make light of their worship. 

Everything I have said to you is the truth the great spirit 
has inspired me and I speak nothing but the truth to you. In 
two moons we shall assemble at the Huron Village (addressing 
himself to the Weas and Pottawatomies) where the great 
belts of all the tribes are kept and there settle our differences. 

Brother. I hope you will confess that you ought not to have 
listened to those bad birds who bring you bad news. I have 
declared myself freely to you and if you want any explanation 
from our Town send a man who can speak to us. 

If you think proper to give us any presents and we can be 
convinced that they are given through friendship alone we will 
accept them. As we intend to hold our council at the Huron 
village that is near the British we may probably make them 
a visit. Should they offer us any presents of goods we will 
not take them but should they offer us powder and the tom- 
hawk we will take the powder and refuse the Tomhawk. 

I wish you Brother to consider everything I have said is 
true and that it is the sentiment of all the red people who 
listen to me. 

By your giving goods to the Kickapoos you kill'd many they 
were seized with the small pox by which many died. 

The Governor began to answer Tecumseh and had proceeded 
for 15 or 20 minutes. He was explaining the justice used by 
the U. States towards the Indians and what he said the In- 
terpreter explained to the Shawonese but before it was ex- 
plained to the Potawatomies and Miamies Tecumseh rose up 



 

and a number of his young men with their war ckibs tom- 
hawks and spears. He spoke for some time with great 
vehemence and anger, which when interpreted appeared to be 
a contradiction of what the Govr. had said and that he had 
lied. The Governor told him that since he had behaved so 
illy he would put out the council fire and not set with him 
again. 

August 21. 

After some explanation offer'd as an apology by Tecumseh, 
the council this day met again, when Tecumseh address'd the 
Governor as follows : 

Brother: There are many white people among you who are 
not true Americans, they are endeavouring to fill the minds 
of the Indians with evil towards the United States of which 
I shall now inform you. The person that informed me was a 
man of sense. 

Brother: He said to us. That when you first began to 
bring about the last treaty you observed the greatest secrecy, 
after which you went to Fort Wayne and there made the 
treaty equally secret, declaring that you did not think it nec- 
essary to call upon us, but that you were determin'd to con- 
fine us to a small piece of land, and that you would bring all 
the tribes who listen to me, to abandon myself and the 
Prophet, and then you would know what to do with us. 

Brother. This person came to our village shortly after the 
Treaty at Fort Wayne and said to us — Lallowachika (the 
Prophet) and you Tecumseh you may believe what I say to 
you, it is not me alone who speaks to you. I am the agent 
of a large party of white people who are your friends and will 
support you, they send me here to inform you everything that, 
that man the Governor at Vincennes is doing against you ; 
but you must observe great secrecy and by no means inform 
him of us, or we shall be hung. I was (continues the person) 
at the Treaty at Fort Wayne and heard the Governor say that 
the Prophet was a bad man and that he would prevent traders 
from trading at his village (the Prophet's) ; or if any did go, 
they should sell their goods so high that the Indians could not 
purchase them, and consequently must suffer. 

Brother. This man further represented to us that you were 
yet to remain in office two years and would be succeeded by a 
good man who was a true friend to the Indians, that you would 



 

offer us goods (annuities) but by no means to accept of them, 
that in order to induce us to take them you would offer us 
horses with saddles and bridles plated with silver, that all the 
goods and even the provisions that you give to the Indians is 
with the intention to cheat them out of their lands. That it 
was the intention of the United States to oppress the Shaw- 
anese before long the white people would push their settle- 
ments so near to them and oblige them to use the ax instead of 
the rifle — therefore recommended to us to take nothing from 
you. 

Brother. Another American told us lately at our village, 
that you were about to assemble the Indians at Vincennes, 
for the purpose of making proposals, for more land — that you 
was placed here by Government to buy land when it was 
offer'd to you, but not to use persuasions and threats to ob- 
tain it. 

Brother. This man told me that I must go to Vincennes 
and make my objections to the purchase of land from the In- 
dians, and not be afraid to speak very loud to you — that when 
you wanted land you was very smooth with the Indians, but 
at length became very boistrous. 

Brother. After my hearing this so often, I could not help 
thinking otherwise than you wished to sow discord amongst 
the Indians. I wish you my Bro. to let alone those distrac- 
tions you have always been endeavouring to establish among 
the Indians. It is doing them a great injury by exciting jeal- 
ousies between them. I am alone the acknowledged head of 
all the Indians. 

Here the Governor requested Tecumseh to state explicitly 
whether surveyors who might be sent to survey the land would 
be interrupted by the Indians and if the Kickapoos would re- 
ceive their annuities that were now here — upon which 
Tecumseh replied. 

Brother. When you speak to me of annuities I look at the 
land, and pity the women and children. I am authorized to 
say that they will not receive them. 

Brother, they want to save that piece of land, we do not 
wish you to take it. It is small enough for our purposes. If 
you do take it you must blame yourself as the cause of trouble 
between us and the Tribes who sold it to you. I want the 
present boundary line to continue, should you cross it. I as- 
sure you it will be productive of bad consequences.

Sir: 

In my letter of last week, I did not mention to you that the 
Wea Tribe was present at all my conferences with the 
prophet's brother [Tecumseh]. The principal chief had sev- 
eral times informed me that it was his intention to tell the 
Shawnese in my presence that neither himself nor any of those 
tribes which are united with him had any right to interfere 
with the sales of land which the native Tribes of the Wabash 
might make to the United States. When the day arrived how- 
ever on which he was to speak he declined saying anything. 
This alteration in his determination was produced either by 
the fear of the Shawnese or the intrigues of the infamous fac- 
tion mentioned in my last. The latter is the more probable as 
the Wea chief informed me that since his arrival here he had 
received a message from the Miami Chiefs, requiring him to 
attend a council at Mississineway for the purpose of consid- 
ering a speech which had lately been sent from the President 
through Mr. [John] Johnston of Fort. Wayne. The purpose 
of which was a request from the President to be informed 
whether the Treaties made the last fall were entered into by 
them voluntarily or not and a declaration that they were made 
without his knowledge or consent. 

I mention this circumstance to show how easily the Indians 
are imposed upon and what villainous artifices are practised 
upon them by unprincipled and designing white men. I be- 
lieve that Wells is in close correspondence with the faction 
here, and that the above story will be traced to him. The 
Weas have given me the names of four persons here, who 
have advised them to unite with the Prophet and insist upon 
the late cession of land being relinquished to them. Indian 
testimony is not however sufficient to punish them if indeed 
our laws provided any punishment for a crime of this nature. 

A young laowa chief, whom I employed to go to the 
Prophets town for the purpose of gaining information, has 
just returned. He is related to an old Winebago Chief, now 
with the Prophet. By him he was informed, that the great 
belt which had been sent round to all the Tribes for the pur- 
pose of uniting them had been returned, and he mentions a 



 

great numbei* that had acceded to the confederacy, the object 
of which was "to confine the great water and prevent it from 
overflowing them". That the Belt, since its return, had been 
sent to [Matthew] Elliot, the British agent, who danced for 
joy upon seeing that so many tribes had united against the 
United States — that the prophet had lately sent a speech to 
his confederates not to be discouraged at the apparent defec- 
tion of some of the Tribes near him — that it was all a sham, 
intended to deceive the white people that these Tribes hated 
the 17 fires and that altho "they gave them sweet words, they 
were like grass plucked up by the roots, they would soon 
wither and come to nothing". The laowa thinks that there 
is no danger of immediate hostilities, it will take them some 
time to get ready against us. The old Winebago chief told 
him, with many tears, that himself and all the village chiefs 
had been divested of their authority and that everything was 
managed by the warriors, who breathed nothing but war 
against the United States. 

There is no man, who has a greater respect than I have for 
the Political talents of Mr. Jeff'erson or a deeper sense of the 
eminent services he has rendered his country. I should be 
guilty of the blackest ingratitude if I did not feel for him all 
the respect and veneration which a recollection of the impor- 
tant benefits I have received at his hands and the friendship 
and confidence with which he honored me are capable of in- 
spiring in the heart of an honest man. But I think it my duty 
to oserve that the integrity of his principles seduced him to 
commit a political error when he caused his agents to effect a 
peace and enjoined them to preserve concord and friendship 
between the various tribes of Indians which inhabit the 
frontier. The mind of a savage is so constructed that he can- 
not be at rest, he cannot be happy unless it is acted upon by 
some strong stimulus that which is produced by war is the only 
one that is sufficiently powerful to fill up the intervals of the 
chase if he hunts in the winter he must go to war in the sum- 
mer, and you may rest assured Sir, that the establishment of 
tranquility between the neighbouring tribes will always be a 
sure indication of war against us. 
• I have the honor to be with great consideration Sir 
Your humble servt. 

William Henry Harrison 



 

P. S. I have this moment signed the abstract of provisions 
issued to the Indians for the last three months, the amount 
is much greater than I had calculated upon but I beg you to 
believe that it was not well to be avoided. I have had nearly 
the whole Wea and Piankeshaw Tribes with me since the 12th 
Instant besides the Prophets party a number of Straglers and 
the Well affected Potawatomies under Winimac and I was un- 
able to get rid of them until today, when their annuities were 
delivered.

Western Sun, September 29, 1810 

By William Henry Harrison Governor and Commander in 
Chief of the Indiana Territory 

A ProcUtniation 

Whereas the circumstances of the Territory require that the 
Legislature should be convened, I have therefore thought 
proper to appoint and do by these presents appoint Monday 
the 12th day of November next, for the Meeting of the same, 
and the Members of the Legislative Council and of the house 
of Representatives and Each and Every of them are hereby 
Required to give their attendance on that day in the Tovm of 
Vincennes accordingly.^ 

Given under my hand and the Seal of the Territory at Vin- 

1. Gomo's village was on Peoria lake. "The most daring of these was committed 
at Portage du Sioux, on July 19th. and created excitement at the time. It appears, 
from the correspondence which it occasioned, that on the night in question a party of 
Sacs stole from William T. Cole. Cornelius Gooch and James Moredough a number of horses 
and other articles. They were immediately pursued by Stephen Cole. James Moredough, 
W. T. Cole and Sarshal Brown, who came up with the band on the next day. They 
were first seen across a prairie, four or five miles ahead. Finding themselves dis- 
covered the Indians kept changing their course, which prevented their pursuers from 
overtaking them. In their rapid march, however, the Indians left behind them a 
quantity of their plunder, consisting of a valuable pack-saddle, seven or eight deer-skins, 
two sides of leather, and some dried venison, the property of Mr. Brown, which was 
recovered. Night coming on. and their horses becoming very fatigued, the pursuers 
concluded to follow no further, and pitched their camp near a small branch, arranging 
that the next day they should continue on to the house of Victor Lagotiere. where 
they would leave the recovered propeity. and get him (who was known to have great 
influence with the Indian tiibes) to inteicede for the recovery of the horses. But about 
two o'clock in the morning, while sleeping around their watch fire they were fired 
upon by the Indians and four of the party, consisting of C. Gooch. Abraham Patten, 
W. T. Cole and Sarshal Brown, iiislanlly lill.d. Stephen Cole was wounded in two 

places and also tomahawked, but h ..,^,.1 l),,in his wounds. It was not, however,

ViNCENNES 5 October 1810 

Heir. Pa. JliJ-Jlio 

Sir: 

Since the visit of the Prophet's brother [Tecumseh] to this 
place, all the information that I have received from the In- 
dian country (until yesterday) corroborates the opinion I had 
formed of the declining influence of the Prophets party. The 
Winebagoes have murdered some of the Kickapoos and Sacs 
and these Tribes, it is said, are determined to revenge them- 
selves. There are also other causes of jealousy between the 
Prophets followers which I will hope completely dissolve the 
confederacy he had formed. Yesterday, however, the son of 
a Wea chief arrived here, being sent by his father to inform 
me that he had heard from an Indian just from the Prophets 
Town that he (the Prophet) absolutely meditated an imme- 
diate attack upon us. I am convinced that not the least credit 
is due to this tale. If the Prophet really has such an inten- 
tion, he has adopted it as a desperate last resort to keep to- 
gether his force which he sees upon the point of being dis- 
solved by the causes I 'have mentioned. The plunging them 
into a war with us might perhaps have that effect, but I 
think it a stroke of policy rather too deep for his talents. 

Captain [Joseph] Cross' detachment will reach this place 
today or tomorrow. The letter of Mr. [John] Smith, your 
chief clerk, of the 5th ultimo did not reach me untill this 
morning, from some irregularity in the mail. I hope and 
believe that the force under Col. [Joseph] Constant will not 
be necessary here, unless it should be deemed inexpedient to 
employ any militia to accompany the regular force that is 
now here to the upper part of a new purchase. 

My plan was if I had received authority from you by this 
mail for so doing, to have called out 150 or 200 militia and 
with these and the regular troops to have immediately pro- 
ceeded up the Wabash and upon some convenient site (as 



 

near the upper line of the purchase as such a one could be 
found) to have erected a strong picketed work and as soon 
as it was put beyond the reach of an assault from the Indians 
or sufficiently supplied with provisions to return with the rest 
of the regulars to this place. The conviction which I formerly 
expressed of the great advantages which would flow from the 
establishment of such a post remains as strong as ever. In- 
deed I think it all important that it should be immediately 
executed. 

With respect to the Militia I should prefer to have them 
mounted, apart at least should be so. The additional ex- 
pense for the short time they would be employed would not 
I suppose be an object. 

I have the Honor to be with the greatest respect Sir 
Your Humble Servt.

Sir: 

The letter of Mr. [John] Smith the chief Clerk of your 
Department reached me last Eve. Cap. [Joseph] Cross's de- 
tachment arrived on the 3rd Instant and are now encamped 
near the Fort. The barracks not being sufficient to receive 
them. No preparation has been made to enlarge the bar- 
racks as it will be altogether unnecessary if the contemplated 
Fort is erected higher up the Wabash. I have four com- 
panies of militia in readiness to attend the Regular Troops 
upon this Expedition and intended to have commenced the 
march in a few days. I shall however wait the arrival of 
further instructions, conformably to Mr. Smith's letter altho 
the season being so far advanced and [Thornton] Posey's 
detachment and the militia being altogether unprovided with 
tents I am almost tempted to take upon myself to do that 
which I am convinced the President would order to be done 
if he were on the spot. 

The tale mentioned in my last respecting the immediate 
hostile designs of the Prophet appears (as I supposed) to be 



 

entirely a fabrication. I should not apprehend the least dan- 
ger in sending up the Regular Troops alone to build the fort, 
but I think that the appearance of a tolerably respectable 
force in their neighbourhood would much accellerate the dis- 
persion of the prophets party and the breaking up of his 
conspiracy. 

One thousand or 1500 men employed in this way for ten 
or twelve days would I am persuaded produce highly bene- 
ficial and lasting effects. But the 4 companies of Militia and 
the regulars (which will not exceed 120 or 130 effectives) will 
be quite sufficient for safety and may answer every other 
purpose. 

1 have sent up [Michael] Buouillette to the Prophets Town 
ostensibly to inform him that the President's absence from 
the seat of Government is the cause of the answer to his 
speech being delayed but in reality to see what is going for- 
ward amongst them. 

I have the honor to be with great consideration Sir 
your Humble Servt.

Fort Wayne, Octr. 14th 1810 

Har. Pa. 375-379 

Sir: 

I have at length got rid of the Indians after a very pro- 
tracted meeting occasioned by the conduct of the manners, 
particularly those of the Massasinnay all the Tribes belong- 
ing to this agency were invited in the usual manner, by Run- 
ners, The Delawares, Shawanees, and Potawatamies Minded 
punctually, the Miamies hung back under various frivolous 
pretences. I was anxious that the whole should be present 
as I had much to communicate to them. I therefore sent a 
second time to the Massasinnway people, but not one would 
come until they found the Delawares were on the return home. 
They then made their appearance. I was previously obliged 
to dismiss the Delawares, Potawatamies and Shawanoes 
which I did perfectly I believe to their satisfaction. After 
coming forward there appeared to be great reluctance on the 



 

part of the Miamies to come into Council. I soon found out 
from confidential friends among them that there was mischief 
going on among them, they at length came forward and 1 met 
them with as much good will as 1 could. 1 was not cordially 
disposed to them, but 1 shifted my feelings. I recounted to 
them everything that passed at Vincennes between your Ex- 
cellency and the Brother of the Prophet. 1 also made them 
acquainted with the proceedings of the late council at firown^,- 
town from the beginning to the inclusion, without naming 
Wells. I introduced the subject that had been agitated among 
them of petitioning for your removal, and endeavoured to 
show them the impropriety of their interfering in such a busi- 
ness and the total impracticability of their succeeding in such 
a measure, I told them that whoever advised them to it was 
a wicked bad man and was not their friend. I told them that 
Governor Harrisson enjoyed the confidence of their great 
Father in an eminent degree and that there was no Chief in 
this country but what he would remove sooner than him, that 
it was all a falsehood about your purchasing their land with- 
out the President's consent, that I never had received any 
messages of the kind alluded to from the President or any 
other person, that if any such persons went to speak to them 
without authority from you not to listen to them, for their 
words were false ; in short I said every thing that I conceived 
calculated to remove the existing bad impressions that has 
been made on their minds, after I had done speaking they 
informed that they would speak the ensuing day. Accord- 
ingly the next day they attended, the Paean was their speaker ; 
he began by allusions to the treaty last fall and the subse- 
quent one with the Kickapoos. He said they were informed 
that the Weas were not satisfied at the Treaty and that there 
was not room enough for them on this side of the new line 
that they the Miamies were forced to agree to the sale of 
the Land, that the Tomahawk was hung over their necks, 
that they would not agree to the Treaty, that it must be 
broke that for their part they would not receive any part of 
the annuity due under the Treaty of last Fall, that this was 
the determination of the whole nation. I told them in reply 
that the cause of their now not coming on was now ascer- 
tained, that they dare not speak in the manner they had done 
before the other Indians, that it was fear of the Prophet and 



 

his party that was the cause of their present conduct that in 
the place of meeting our friends the Miamies, I was greatly 
dissapointed at meeting a band of the Prophet's followers, 
in fact every sentiment they uttered was in unison with those 
of the Prophet. I told them that their Father's patience had 
been exhausted with the insolence of the Prophet, that he 
did not wish to use force in defence of his own rights, but 
that this conduct of theirs would be the very cause of his 
sending his warriors up the Wabash, that they never would 
get a foot of the land back again, that the Treaty was a fair 
Treaty and that we should proceed to survey the land and 
settle it as soon as it suited our convenience, the Paean here 
replied and said, if we held the land we must build a bridge 
across it. I told him if it became necessary we would build 
a bridge of warriors with rifles in their hands, that we had 
lost Genl. Wayne but that our country furnished many Genl. 
Waynes. I endeavoured to show the foolishness of their con- 
duct for I had paid part of their money away agreeably to 
the order of their chiefs. I had paid Wells the $350 in cash 
due the Eel Rivers under the Treaty of last fall on an order 
signed by the Chief Charley and the Earth in presence of 
two of the officers of the garrison, however it has appeared 
since that Wells cheated them out of this sum, as they did 
not know it was an order for their money they were signing 
at the time. The next day I found that all the Miamies ex,- 
cept the Massasineway Chiefs and Charley were willing to 
receive their annuity. I accordingly gave out that I would 
deliver them to those who would come forward and receive 
them as I was determined not to yield to the opposition of 
a few, finding that the thing was by no means general as I 
had at first expected when the Massassinway chiefs found 
themselves deserted by all the others Charley excepted, they 
set off to Detroit with about thirty of their men. Immedi- 
ately after their departure I delivered out the annuities to 
the Chiefs and sent them home perfectly satisfied. I sup- 
pose the Massasinnway people has been corrupted by the 
Prophet's council and wished to follow the example of the 
Weas in refusing their goods, if they had been indulged the 
contagion would have spread and would have been followed 
by the other Tribes. I therefore thought it the soundest policy 
to check and oppose the thing the first moment of its appear- 



 

ance in this quarter. I trust my conduct will meet your ap- 
probation, not having- the least doubt but it will have a good 
effect with these rascalls hereafter, for they have been spoiled 
to all intents and purposes heretofore from the immense num- 
ber of Potawatimies that attended I was obliged to give them 
$500 addl. out of the store and $150 to the Shawanees to 
reconcile them to the stoppage made at the War office. The 
following is a correct account of the number of Indians that 
attended this years meeting: 

viz. 

Potawatimies 646 

Delawares & Muncies 400 

Shawanoese 320 

Miamies 387 

Eel Rivers 22 

Ottaways 4 

1779 Total 

You will perceive from this statement that the number of 
Indians that attended this year exceeds by near 400 what 
attended at the Treaty, the expense of course has been con- 
siderable, it has been as small as it could be under existing 
circumstances. In order to check the very improper temper 
which has been discovered with this year past among the 
Indians particularly of the Wabash measures ought to be 
taken to establish a Post somewhere in the vicinity of the 
Prophet and the sooner a step of this kind is taken the better. 

The Prophet had two of his people here during the whole 
conference. I took no notice of them and treat'd them as the 
others they heared all that passed and returned home im- 
mediately after the Miamies. 

I have the honor to enclose for your satisfaction the pro- 
ceedings of the council at Brownstown,' together with Gov- 
ernor Hull's letter to me accompanying the papers. I have 
endeavoured to trace the story of the Message that should 
have went thro' me to the Massasinneway people and all I 
have heared is from the Owl who asserts that it came from 
Wells and who further says that all the mischief that is 
going among them has sprung from Wells and the Turtle. 

1. Brownstown at the mouth of Huron river about 20 miles south of Detroit. The 
proceedings mentioned have not been found- 



 

Wells is undoubtedly gone to Washington to make interest 
and if he fails in getting into office again I am told he in- 
tended to try for the contract he has here in the state of 
Ohio on his way thro' to Kentucky endeavoured to asperse 
all the measures that has been adopted by you relative to the 
objects of the Prophet. 

I have the honor to remain with very great respect

Sir: 

Mr. [Michael] Brouillette returned last evening from the 
town of the Prophet. The latter expressed himself much 
pleased with my message and treated Brouillette with un- 
usual friendship. He still however expressed his determina- 
tion not to permit the lands lately purchased to be surveyed 
and boasted much of the number of men he had at his com- 
mand. I am however fully persuaded that there is not the 
least probability that he will make any hostile attempt. Gov- 
ernor [William] Hull and Mr. [John] Johnston will no doubt 
have informed you of the result of the late council of Indians 
near Lake Erie [Brownstown] . Neither the Prophet nor his 
brother attended. Anticipating no doubt a determination un- 
favorable to their wishes. 

I still wait your determination on the subject of the pro- 
posed fort. It has been my intention to accompany the de- 
tachment which is employed on this service as well for the 
purpose of debating the site for the fort and presei-ving har- 
mony and union between the regular troop and the militia 



 

as to prevent any sinister result from an accidental collission 
of our parties with those of the Indians. My services on the 
occasion will be voluntary and I neither desire nor expect 
any compensation for them. 

Some of the Regular officers have before served under me 
and they all express the greatest satisfaction at being placed 
under my command. As no part of the corps to which Cap- 
tain [Joseph] Cross belongs is here I have advised Captain 
[Geo. R. C] Floyd to pei-mit him to go with his Lieutenant 
to join his Company at the Cantonement near St. Louis. 

I neglected to mention to you in my last that the Head 
Chief of the Weas had arrived a few days before to receive 
that part of their annuity which was due for the late treaties 
and which he had formerly refused. 

I am with the greatest respect Sir

Sir: 

As your final instructions upon the subject of the proposed 
garrison in the new purchase have not yet reached me and 
the season being so far advanced as to leave little probability 
of our finding in the woods a sufficiency of provision for the 
horses which it would be necessary to take with us, I have 
given up all idea of the expedition for this winter unless 
your next letter should bring me positive orders to under- 
take it. Another reason for declining it, is the sickly state 
of the detachment lately commanded by Capt. [Joseph] Cross 
which has been much afflicted with the Dysentery from its 
first arrivals and the disease appears rather to be gaining 
ground than decreasing. Capt. [Geo. R. C] Floyd will im- 
mediately bend all his attention towards making his men as 
comfortable as possible and as soon as a sufficiency of tents 
are erected for their reception a system of training will be 
commenced and regularly attended to whenever the weather 
will permit. In this business I will give Captn. Floyd all the 



 

assistance in my power. [No] Other expense has attended 
our preparations for the march than the purchase of some 
axes and a few tools. The axes (40 I believe) were neces- 
sary to erect the fort with dispatch and it was also my inten- 
tion to have placed the troops each night under the cover of 
a breastwork of trees after the example of General Wayne. 

I have the Honor to be with the highest respect Sir your

Har. Pa. IJ, U 

Gov. W. H. Harrison Sir: 

Having consulted the President on the subject of your Ex- 
cellency's letter of the 10th instant, I have the honor to in- 
form you of his decision, that it is not expedient to make 
the military movement to establish the post on the new pur- 
chase on the Wabash, or to run the line the present season. 
The considerations which have led to this determination are 
various; among them, altho' not the most prominent, are the 
lateness of the season and the existing state of things in West 
Florida which may require the whole of our disposable force 
on the Western waters. 

[Capt. Thornton] Posey's Company with the detachment 
under [Joseph] Cross should therefore in case they shall not 
have marched, be quartered near Vincennes, either in huts 
for the winter, or such other temporaiy accommodations as 
the Country affords, holding themselves in readiness to de- 
scend the Mississippi. 

Capt. Cross being an artillery Officer & detached for St. 
Louis was not intended for a permanent command in the 
Indiana Territory & will be ordered there. In the Spring 
of the year a favorable opportunity will offer in which to 
establish a strong post & display a respectable force on the 
Wabash. I am perfectly satisfied that this is the only effi- 
cient language to be held to the Prophet & his adherents & 
the most peaceable measure which can be adopted. 

It has indeed occurred to me that the surest means of se- 



 

curing good behavior from this conspicuous personage & his 
brother, would be to make them prisoners. But at this time 
more particularly it is desirable that peace with all the In- 
dian tribes should be preserved, and I am instructed by the 
President to express to your Excellency his expectation and

ViNCENNES 7th Nov. 1810 
Har. Pa. JT2-37J, 

Sir: 

I enclose herewith the copy of a letter [Oct. 14, above] 
received last evening from Mr. [John] Johnson the agent 
at Fort Wayne. The Miamis who are there represented to 
be so dissatisfied with the Treaty of Fort Wayne as late as 
the month of July last, when Col. [Francis] Vigo was with 
them, had discovered no cause of complaint against it. The 
poison has been since that time infused into their minds. I 
have good grounds to believe that the scheme originated with 
a scotch tory [William Mcintosh] who lives at this place and 
that [William] Wells was the instrument made use of to 
effect it. To enable you to form a correct opinion of what 
this man is capable of to effect his purposes, you need only 
refer to the correspondence betvv^een the War Department and 
him and that department and myself in the spring and sum- 
mer of the year 1805 or to ask of Genl. [Henry] Dearborn 
to give you a sketch of his conduct relatively to a treaty con- 
cluded by me with the Delawares. I am persuaded that you 
can scarcely from an idea of the villainous intrigues which 
are carried on with the Indians in this country by foreign 
agents and other disaffected persons. I have not heard from 
the surveyor [McDonald] who set out to run the boundary 
line since his arrival at the point from which his work is to 
commence but I do not believe that he will be interrupted 
indeed he may finish the woi'k before it is known by the 
Prophets party that it is commenced. Tecumseh, the Prophets 
brother, set out about ten days ago to visit the British Agent 
at Maiden. The Wea Chiefs are frequently with me and ap- 



 

pear to have gotten over their fit of sulkiness entirely as well 
the Miamis, beyond all doubt if they are treated in the man- 
ner that Mr. Johnson has set out with. A party of Kicka- 
poos from the village of the Prairie, the principal town, 
headed by several chiefs, have been with me for the purpose 
of receiving their annuities. I have refused to give a blanket 
untill all or a majority of the Chiefs shall attend and formally 
and solemnly renounce the Prophet's party and again put 
themselves under the protection of their father the Presi- 
dent. They left this a few days since, pouring execrations 
upon the Prophet and the British — nothing could come more 
directly home to their feelings than this refusal for they are 
almost literally naked. The whole tribe will no doubt be 
here in a short time. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir 
Your Humble Servt.

Gov. W. H. Harrison Sir, 

Your Excellency's letter of the 24th of October is received 
and it is satisfactory to learn that the arrangements made 
by your Excellency will correspond with the determination 
of the President, which I had the honor to communicate on 
the 26th of October. 

Pistols & Horsemen's Swords have been ordered to be de- 
posited at Newport Ky. from which the mounted militia may 
be supplied (on the order & receipt of your Excellcy) under 
the Law providing for arming the whole body of militia. 
Rifles may also be delivered under the same law. 

I am, respectfully &c. &c.

Tench Coxe, Esq. Sir, 

I will thank you to enquire and inform me whether there 
is to be found in Phila. a man who has worked in mines, of 
sober habits, a practical mineralist, who would be willing to 



 

go to Detroit and from thence to Lake Superior, to accom- 
pany a Gentleman who will be selected for the purpose of 
exploring the Copper Mines on the margin of that Lake and 
in case a suitable person should offer, what compensation he 
would require, for a tour of duty which would occupy six or 
nine months. As he will be employed in working out the 
metal it will be seen that an experienced workman, and not 
a theorist is required.'

Har. Pa. U30-A33 

A Numerous meeting of the Citizens of the Indiana Territory 
To James Madison President United States : 
Sir: a numerous assemblage of a people occupying a re- 
spectable section of the Indiana territory address you — and in 
this t'-j^ir manner of approval they were fully aware that they 
virtually present themselves before the first personage of the 
continent — not with that dread that debased man dared to pe- 
tition the potent monarchs of the old world — whose steps 
reddened by the blood of the unfortunate part of their fellow 
mortals, forms the most prominent feature of character — But 
Sir as freemen acquainted with their rights in you we do our- 
selves the honor to respect the sovereignty and majesty of the 
federative union — constituting a great nation and the only 
one whose policy is marked by honesty — and you the only man 
now bearing rule in a sovereign capacity whose virtues raised 
you to the zenith of exaltation — and whom future historians 
will endeavour to outvie each other, in placing in the most 
illustrious view — whose acts when centuries have rolled away 
will be deemed of highest historical importance — whilst we 
acknowledge our steady attachment to the constituted author- 
ities of our country — we cease not to admire the firmness and 
patriotic zeal evidenced in your conduct, towards the contend- 
ing Belligerants. It is a matter of regret that even we so far 
in the interiour cannot be shielded from the effects of the more 
than savage policy of Britain — in constantly keeping commis- 
saries for the corruption of our aboriginal neighbours — and 
it is still more lamentable that strong grounds of presump-

tion exist that there are those resident amongst us engaged in 
the nefarious design — But to our Executive we honestly at- 
tribute public tranquility and the encreasing prosperity of the 
Territory — Although the proceedings of these individuals, may 
by the mildness of our laws, elude the definitions of legal crim- 
inality, yet we are not less sensible of this moral culpability, 
nor are the effects of their political mischief less execrable for 
they proceed from the very forms of corruption — Nothwith- 
standing Sir that we are not entitled in our present grade 
to all those privileges that the individual states of the union 
enjoy yet we are perfectly tranquil — nor do we find that any 
inconvenience is the result of that privation — whilst favoured 
with the man in the continuity of the excecise of his duties of 
Gubernation that faithfully discharged them many years past 
with a distinguished reputation — that no man occupying a 
similar station can form a paralel. But we should do injustice 
to public feeling, if we were to stop here or even indifferently 
acknowledge our sense of the laborious assiduity, patient in- 
vestigation, and intrepid conduct of his Excellency William 
Henry Harrison, on the late momentious occasion of Indian 
Aifairs — But to particularize the many instances in which the 
military, the legislative and executive talents of this states- 
man has been displayed would be to exhibit a history which 
the limitations of an address prohibiting and the President's 
knowledge of the zeal and manner with which this gentleman 
has on every occasion and in every situation discharged that 
portion of official business to him entrusted, evinces a great- 
ness of talents that render such a detail unessential — But it 
would be undutious in us not to pay more than common def- 
erence to that strength of intellect that suits his acute and 
distracting mind, to the education of principles and compre- 
hension of results which ever terminate favourable to the na- 
tion and those honored by his Government — and permit us to 
declare it the well grounded opinion of the people in their 
associated capacity that his Excellency the Governor merit the 
entire confidence of the people of Indiana, and possess it, and 
also entitled to the Patronage of the President of the United 
States — and that his brillient genius render him competent, 
and his virtues worthy of employ in any station however im- 
portant, that the ordinary or extraordinary circumstances of 
the country may demand on motion the foregoing adopted by 
an unanimous vote of the citizens present, and ordered to be

Annual Message 

November 12, 1810 

Vincennes Western Sun, December 8, 1810 
Dawson, Harrison, 16^ 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and House of Repre- 
sentatives:^ 

The length of time which has elapsed since the territory 
has had the advantage of a Legislature, makes a meeting with 
you at this time particularly agreeable to me. I know not, in- 
deed, of any great injury which our citizens have sustained 
for the want of legislative aid, but there are some subjects 
which could not much longer remain unattended to without 
producing inconvenience. Some of these I shall notice in my 
present address, and others will form the subjects of future 
special communications. 

Presenting as we do a very extended frontier to numerous 
and warlike tribes of the aborigines, the state of our relations 
with them must always form an important and interesting 
feature in our local politicks. It is with regret that I have 
to inform you that the harmony and good understanding 
which it is so much our interest to cultivate with these our 
neighbors have for some time past experienced a considerable 
interruption, and that we have indeed been threatened with

where this meeting: was held.

488 INDIANA illSTORICAL COLLECTIONS 

hostilities by a combination formed under the auspices of a 
bold adventurer, who pretends to act under the immediate in- 
spiration of the Deity. His character as a Prophet would not, 
however, have given him any very dangerous influence, if he 
had not been assisted by the intrigues and advice of foreign 
agents, and other disafi'ected persons who have for many 
years omitted no opportunity of counteracting the measures of 
the government with regard to the Indians, and filling their 
naturally jealous minds with suspicions of the justice and 
integrity of our views towards them. 

The circumstance which was laid hold of to encourage dis- 
affection on the late occasion was the treaty made by me at 
Fort Wayne, in the autumn of the last year. Amongst the 
difficulties which were to be encountered to obtain those ex- 
tinguishments of title which have proved so beneficial to the 
Treasury of the United States, and so necessary as the means 
of increasing the population of the territory, the most formid- 
able was that of ascertaining the tribes which were to be ad- 
mitted as parties to the treaties. The subject was accordingly 
discussed in a lengthy correspondence between the government 
and myself, and the principles which were finally adopted 
were made as liberal towards the Indians as a due regard to 
the interests of the United States would permit. Of the tribes 
which had formed the confederacy in the war which was ter- 
minated by the peace of Greenville [1795], some were resi- 
dents upon the lands which were in possession of their fore- 
fathers at the time that the first settlements were made in 
America by the white people, whilst others- which were emi- 
grants from distant parts of the continent had no other claim 
to the tracts they occupied than what a few years residence, 
by the tacit consent of the real owners, could give. Upon 
common and general pi-inciples, the transfer of the title of the 
former description would have been sufficient to vest in the 
purchaser the legal right to lands so situated. But in all its 
transactions with the Indians our government has not been 
contented with doing that which was just only. Its savage 
neighbors have on all occasions experienced its liberality and 
its benevolence. Upon this principle, in several of the treaties 
which have been made, tribes have been admitted to a partici- 



 

pation in their benefits who had no title to the lands ceded, 
merely because they had been accustomed to hunt upon and 
derive part of their support from them. For this reason, and 
to prevent the Miamies, who were the real owners of the land, 
from experiencing any ill effects from their resentment, in 
case they were excluded, the Delawares, Putawatamies, and 
Kickapoos, were made parties to the late treaty of Fort 
Wayne. No other tribe was admitted, because it never had 
been suggested that any other could plead even the title of use 
or occupancy of the lands which at that time were conveyed 
to the United States. It was not until eight months after the 
conclusion of the treaty, and after his design of forming a 
hostile combination against the United States had been dis- 
covered and defeated, that the pretensions of the Prophet with 
regard to the lands were made known. A furious clamour 
was then raised by the foreign agents amongst us, and other 
disaffected persons, against the policy which had excluded 
from the treaty this great, influential character, as he was 
termed, and the doing so expressly attributed to personal ill 
will upon the part of the negociator. No such ill will did in 
fact exist. I accuse myself, indeed, of an error in the patron- 
age and support which I afforded him upon his first arrival on 
the Wabash, before his designs of hostility to the United 
States had been developed. But upon no principle of pro- 
priety or policy could he have been made a party to the treaty. 
The personage called the Prophet is not a chief of the tribe to 
which he belongs, but is an outcast from it, rejected and hated 
by the real chiefs, the principal of whom [Hockingpomskon] 
was present at the treaty, and not only disclaimed upon the 
part of his tribe any title to the lands ceded, but used his per- 
sonal influence vdth the chiefs of the other tribes to effect the 
cession. 

As soon as I was informed that his disaffection at the late 
treaty was assigned as the cause of the hostile attitude the 
Prophet had assumed, I sent to inform him that whatever 
claims he might have to the lands which had been purchased 
for the United States, were not in the least affected by that 
purchase — that he might come forward and exhibit his pre- 
tentions, and if they were really found to be just or equitable, 
the lands would be restored, or an ample equivalent given for 
them. His brother was deputized and sent to me for that 
purpose [August 12-20, 1810]. But far from being able to 



 

shew any colour of claim, either for himself, or any of his fol- 
lowers, his objections to the treaty were confined to the as- 
sertion that all the land upon the continent was the common 
property of all the tribes, and that no sale of any part of it 
could be valid, without the consent of all. A proposition so 
extremely absurd, and which would forever prevent any fur- 
ther purchase of lands by the United States, could receive no 
countenance from any friend to his country. He had, how- 
ever, the insolence to declare, that by the acknowledgment of 
that principle alone could the effects of his resentment be 
avoided. No person who is in the least acquainted with the 
history of Indian affairs upon our northwestern frontier, for 
some years past, can be at any loss for the source of all this 
mischief, or will hesitate to believe that the Prophet is a tool 
of British fears or Bi'itish avarice, designed for the purpose 
of forming a combination of the Indians, which in case of war 
between that power and the United States may assist them in 
the defence of Canada, or as the means of keeping back our 
settlements, and by rendering us suspected and hated by the 
natives, secure to themselves a continuance of the valuable fur 
trade, which they have so long engrossed. It gives me great 
pleasure, however, to state to you, gentlemen, that the greater 
part of the neighboring tribes have continued firm in their 
attachment to the United States, in despite of the artful and 
malicious stories which have been circulated, and the goods 
distributed amongst them, for the purpose of producing a con- 
trary disposition. I have every reason to believe that the 
Prophet and his party have been for some time losing ground, 
nor do I believe that he will ever be able to form a confederacy 
strong enough to commence hostilities. As long, however, as 
he continues in his present position, it may be in his power to 
raise those alarms which have so mischievious an effect in re- 
tarding the population of our country. 

I have been thus particular, gentlemen, in giving you infor- 
mation upon the present state of our affairs with the neigh- 
boring Indians, that you may have them fully before you in 
case you should think proper to make them in any shape the 
subject of your deliberations. Although the management of 
Indian affairs, in relation to their character as an independent 
people and to the trade with them in their own country, is 
entirely and exclusively under the control of the United States, 
it has been determined that the regulations for the govern- 



 

ment of the latter are of no force in our settlements. Every 
person has been allowed to trade with them who pleases, which 
proves a source of numberless abuses of mischievous effect, 
both to the Indians and ourselves. Should you think proper 
to pass a law either prohibiting the trade of Indians within 
our settlements altogether, or confining it to the frontiers and 
obliging those who follow it to take out licenses, I am per- 
suaded your constituents would receive from it much benefit. 
It will be worthy of your consideration, also, whether some 
penalty might not be advantageously imposed upon those who, 
by improper interferences and by circulating falsehoods 
amongst the Indians, counteract the intentions of the govern- 
ment, and lay the foundation for distrust and enmities which 
may produce the most serious consequences. It is believed 
that to intrigues of this kind we are indebted for much of the 
uneasiness and dissatisfaction which has prevailed in the In- 
dian country for the last six months. The brother of the 
Prophet expressly declared, in the presence of a large audi- 
ence, that two secret visits had been made to his town by 
diff'erent white men, who urged him to oppose the execution 
of the late treaty, and who assured him that his pretensions 
would be supported by a considerable portion of our citizens. 
No treaty was ever concluded with the Indians under happier 
auspices than that of Fort Wayne. A number of highly re- 
spectable characters were witnesses to its progress and final 
termination, and to the satisfaction with which the chiefs and 
the whole body of warriors assented to its conditions. For 
upwards of ten months from this date, not a lisp of discontent 
was heard from any of those who were parties to it. So late 
as the month of July last, a worthy and patriotic citizen of 
this neighborhood was sent to the Miamies to obtain their 
consent to a conditional article in the Kickapoo treaty. This 
gentleman was received at the principal village with great 
cordiality and respect, and assurance given him not only that 
the original treaty would be cheerfully complied with, but 
that the article in that with the Kickapoos', which was the 
particular object of his mission (and with which they were 
under no obligation to comply), would be ratified as soon as 
they could assemble all the chiefs of their tribe. But by a 
communication which has just been received from the agent 
at Fort Wayne, it appears that the chiefs who were at that 
time so cordial in their feelings towards the treaty have been 



 

since convinced that the treaty was forced upon them, con- 
trary to their incHnation, and that it was necessary for them 
to petition the President to annul the treaty, and remove from 
office the person who negotiated it. It is very remarkable 
that the very words by which the Indians conveyed their com- 
plaint are almost the same which were used in the conversa- 
tion of some persons within our settlements. What has 
passed, gentlemen, is not to be affected by any law you may 
enact; and I think I may venture to assure you that, as soon 
as the Indians are convinced that our government is not to 
be trifled with, we shall hear no more of opposition to the 
execution of the treaty. 

The disaffection (of those who were parties to the treaty 
I mean) is confined to a part of one tribe only. But the 
effects which these intrigues may produce upon any future 
attempt to treat with the Indians for their lands ought, if pos- 
sible, to be avoided. Although much has been done toward 
the extinguishment of Indian title in the territory, much still 
remains to be done. We have not yet a sufficient space to 
form a tolerable state. The eastern settlements are separated 
from the western by a considerable extent of Indian lands, and 
the most fertile tracts that are within our territorial bounds 
are still their property. Almost entirely divested of the game 
from which they have drawn their subsistence, it has become 
of little use to them ; and it was the intention of the govern- 
ment to substitute for the precarious and scanty supplies 
which the chase affords the more certain support which is de- 
rived from agriculture and the rearing of domestic animals. 
By the considerate and sensible amongst them this plan is 
considered as the only one which will save them from utter 
extirpation. But a most formidable opposition has been raised 
to it by the warriors, who will never agree to abandon their 
old habits until driven to it by absolute necessity. As long as 
a deer is to be found in their forests they will continue to 
hunt. It has, therefore, been considered that confining them 
to narrow limits was the only means of producing this highly 
desirable change and averting the destiny which seems to im- 
pend over them. Are then those extinguishments of native 
title — which are at once so beneficial to the Indians, the ter- 
ritory, and the United States — to be suspended on account of 
the intrigues of a few individuals ? Is one of the fairest por- 
tions of the globe to remain in a state of nature, the haunt of 



 

a few wretched savages, when it seems destined by the 
Creator to give support to a large population, and to be the 
seat of civilization, of science, and of true religion? It may 
be asked, perhaps, how these effects can be produced by a few 
persons whose opportunities of intercourse with the Indians 
are so very limited. Nothing is more easy than to excite the 
jealousy and suspicion of a savage, and to make him believe 
that he is imposed upon. And upon no subject are their 
passions more easily raised, than that of their lands. Every 
treaty that has been made with them has proved a work of 
difficulty. Besides their natural prejudices, the clashing in- 
terests of the several tribes were to be accommodated, the in- 
juries they have received from white people palliated and ex- 
cused, and the fears, excited by seeing so many tribes driven 
from their ancient seats by the progress of our settlements, 
lulled, or diverted by opening brighter prospects as the re- 
ward of their fidelity. A single artful or imprudent observa- 
tion from a designing or careless individual is frequently 
sufficient to destroy the labor of weeks, and induce the Indians 
to abandon an intention which they seemed to have adopted 
after the maturest deliberation. Although I am persuaded 
that the blackest treachery and hatred towards our govern- 
ment and nation have produced some of the intrigues of which 
I complain, I am also convinced that much mischief has been 
done by others who, actuated by no views that were inimical 
to their country, have suffered their passions, prejudices, and 
personal animosities to lead them astray, and to do that which 
their cooler judgments must condemn. Whilst a penal law 
would perhaps deter the former, it would be the means, as an 
expression of the public sentiment, of reclaiming the latter to 
their duty. Should you think proper to take the subject under 
your consideration, gentlemen, the original documents in my 
possession, in support of what is here advanced, will be sub- 
mitted to you. 

There is still, gentlemen, some defect in our revenue laws. 
Altho' it is ascertained that the taxes which are due are more 
than sufficient to answer all the expenses of the government, a 
number of old claims remain unsatisfied, nor is there a dollar 
in the treasury belonging to the contingent fund. As a meas- 
ure tending to the great relief of the poor, the Legislature two 
years ago, upon my recommendation, took off the tax upon 
neat cattle and single young men, and substituted an addi- 



 

tional tax upon lands for county purposes in lieu of it. I rec- 
ommended at that time also to lower the tax upon horses, par- 
ticularly those that are employed in agriculture. It appears 
to me that the tax of fifty cents per head must be very op- 
pressive to the poorer class of our citizens. 

The court of Chancery, gentlemen, is still in the situation in 
which the law that created it left it. No provision has yet 
been made for the compensation of the Chancellor and the 
other officers of the court. The opinion given by me to a for- 
nier Legislature on this subject continues the same: "If ever 
there was a country where a court of Chancery was necessary, 
ours is the one; because in no other (as I believe) has there 
ever been so much valuable property transferred without the 
observance of the legal forms of conveyance, or where the 
evasion of the specific performance of contracts would produce 
so much confusion, injustice, and ruin. It is not many years 
since the bare assignment of title to lands upon a bit of paper, 
without any of those peculiar phrases which our laws require 
in the transfer of real property, was deemed both by the buyer 
and seller a sufficient conveyance ; indeed there have been in- 
stances where the delivery of possession has been considered 
and accepted as sufficient evidence of purchase. To enforce 
the observance of bona fide contracts made in this manner it 
is believed a court of Chancery is alone competent. Nor is 
it by any means that loose and fluctuating tribunal which 
some have considered it, where will, and not law, presides, 
and where the abitrary opinion of the judge is the only rule 
of decision. It is, on the contrary, bound down by rules and 
laws as well defined and as well understood as those of any 
other court; and as it compels the specific performance of 
contracts, and enables contending parties reciprocally to avail 
themselves of facts which might otherwise be forever buried 
in the bosoms of their opponents, it is particularly calculated 
to protect the simple and ignorant against the artful and 
designing." 

The Judiciary system may also, perhaps, be susceptible of 
improvement. Should it be thought from the number of new 
counties which are in contemplation that a Superior court 
cannot be holden in each, a district might be composed of sev- 
eral contiguous counties. 

With respect to the militia, gentlemen, I am at a loss what 
to recommend, because our finances are so limited that I fear 



 

we could not easily provide the means of supporting them in 
those camps of discipline which I have formerly recommended, 
and in which military duty can alone bo taught. If you think, 
however, that the treasury could bear the expense, or that it 
would not impose on the men too great a burden to oblige them 
to furnish their own provision, I am persuaded that the muster 
days directed by the present law would be most usefully com- 
muted for even the same number of days successfully devoted 
to military improvement in a camp. Altho' I almost despair 
from the scantiness of our means of seeing our militia arrive 
at that high state of perfection which they ought to attain, 
much may nevertheless be done towards keeping up that spirit 
of improvement until the genera! government shall provide 
an uniform system for the whole continent, and the means for 
carrying it into effect. 

But your attention, gentlemen, may in the mean time be most 
usefully directed to the rising generation. Military discipline 
consists in a number of minute observances, which collectively 
form a beautiful and connected system but considered indi- 
vidually appear trifling and even ridiculous. Hence it hap- 
pens that so many persons become disgusted with military 
duty before they have .seen the application of those appar- 
ently frivolous orders which are given to the novitiate in arms. 
Youth, being more docile, is therefore the proper period for 
military as well as every other species of instruction. And 
next to that knowledge of their rights when they become men 
and citizens, what is more necessary than to teach them the 
art by which these rights are to be defended? Ours is, I be- 
lieve, the only republic that ever existed which neglected this 
important part of education. In the republics of Greece, the 
exercises of the gymnasium always succeeded the studies and 
and lectures of the lyceum ; and in that of Rome, a strict atten- 
tion to the duties of the Campus Martius was exacted of every 
youthful candidate for citizenship. 

The liberality of Congress, gentlemen, has committed to 
your control a section of land in each township for the use of 
schools, and the seminary at this place [Vincennes] is sup- 
ported also by a considerable benefaction [a congressional 
township] in the same species of property. Let me earnestly 
recommend to you, that in the system of education which you 
may establish for those schools the military branch may not 
be forgotten. Let the masters of the inferior schools be 



 

obliged to qualify themselves and instruct their pupils in the 
military evolutions, whilst the University, in addition to those 
exercises, may have attached to it a professorship of tactics, 
in which all the sciences connected with the art of war may 
be taught. I can see no reasonable objection to this plan. It 
will afford healthful exercise and amusement to the youth, in- 
spire them with patriotic sentiments, and furnish our militia 
with a succession of recruits, all of them habituated to the 
performance of military evolutions and some of them with 
considerable attainments in the higher branches of tactics. 
The sole additional expence to the ordinary mode of education, 
independent of the additional professorship in the University, 
will be the procuring for each subordinate school a number of 
mock firelocks of wood, a few martial instruments, and for the 
higher schools a few hundred real guns of the cheapest manu- 
facture. 

Since the last session of the Legislature, gentlemen, I have 
received for the fourth time, from the President and Senate 
of the United States, an appointment to the Executive duties 
of this territory. I hope that I duly appreciate this mark of 
continued confidence in the government of my country; but 
I will not attempt to deny that the circumstance connected 
with the appointment, from which I have derived much satis- 
faction, is the zeal and anxiety which were manifested in my 
favor by the great majority of your constituents, expressed as 
well by themselves as their representatives to the last General 
Assembly. Will you be pleased, gentlemen, to bear them my 
most sincere thanks for the confidence and support with which 
they have favored me for so many years. Assure them that 
their interests and happiness will ever be the great objects for 
which I shall labor, and that I shall always consider their ap- 
probation as the greatest reward for any services which, 
through the assistance of Divine Providence, I shall be able to 
render them. ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^ Harrison 

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES Decembr. 24th 1810 

Ojj,. Her. Pa. JS0-.386 

Your letters of the 26th of Oct. and 10th of Novembr. were 
duly receiv'd. Nothing extraordinary has happened in rela- 



 

tion to Indian affairs, since I had the honor to write to you 
in October. 

When I heared last from the Prophet's Town, Tecumseh 
had not returned from his visit to upper Canada. The Presi- 
dent's injunction with regard to the preservation of peace 
with the Indians shall be faithfully attended to. I believe 
indeed that there will be no great difficulty in the affair. The 
Prophet's threats against those who should receive their an- 
nuities, have been in a great measure disregarded. Even the 
Kickapoos to a considerable number have been in to receive 
theirs. As it was not a complete representation of the Tribe, 
half of the goods only were delivered, the rest are still in 
my possession, but I am persuaded that the party which has 
hung back will apply for them before the Winter is out. 
Altho' I am persuaded, that there is not at present any prob- 
ability of an Indian war, the affairs of that department are 
by no means in such a situation as I could wish them. The 
Indians appear to be more uneasy and dissatisfied than I 
ever before saw them, and I believe that the Prophet's prin- 
ciple, that their lands should be considered common property, 
is either openly avowed or secretly favored by all the Tribes, 
west of the Wabash. A Wea Chief who attended their late 
council at Bro\vnstown informs me that a resolution to pre- 
vent the sale of any more lands to the United States, was 
entered into by the chiefs after Governor Hull had left them. 
That the British Agent [Matthew] Elliott strongly recom- 
mended this measure to them, and informed them that the 
English and French had made peace and would soon unite 
their arms to dispossess the Americans of the lands they had 
taken from the Indians. 

The Miamies have been so much frightened by the threats 
of the Prophet and his party and the jealousy which other 
Tribes not connected with the Prophet have manifested of their 
exclusive pretentions to the lands on the Wabash, that I should 
not be greatly surprised if they were to abandon their claim 
and acknowledge a community of interest with the other 
Tribes. A step of this sort would be of infinite prejudice to 
the United States. It would shut the door against any fur- 
ther extinguishment of Indian title upon the valuable tract 
of country south of the Wabash, which is now embraced by 
our settlements upon three sides. And upon the obtaining of 
which the public opinion in the Western country is so fixed 



 

that it will be difficult for the Government to divert it to any 
other district. The tide of immigration from Pennsylvania 
and the State of Ohio rolls directly against it. The little 
tract which was purchased to the west of the Greenville 
boundary will be soon filled up to the very line and our back- 
woods men are not of a disposition to content themselves with 
land of an inferior quality when they see in their immediate 
neighbourhood the finest country as to soil in the world occu- 
pied by a few wretched savages. The members of the Ter- 
ritorial legislature which has been lately in session warmly 
recommended to me to smooth the way for another extinguish- 
ment of title parallel to the Grouseland purchase and I must 
confess that my own views are strongly directed to that meas- 
ure. I am indeed interested in the question ; for without such 
further purchase Indiana cannot for many years become a 
member of the Union and I am heartily tired of living in a 
Ten-itory. You will pardon me Sir for my presumption in 
intruding my opinions upon you but I really think that the 
Indian affairs in this country require the particular atten- 
tion of the Government, that is if further purchase of land 
in this quarter have entered into the scope of its policy, for 
whether those purchases are made at this time or delayed 
for several years measures may now be taken which may 
greatly facilitate them or if neglected when the day arrives, 
on which they may be desirable, intrusions of other claims 
and titles may have intervened, which may totally disappoint 
our expectations. I must at any rate beg of you a solution 
of and directions upon a question which may arise, or which 
may be brought to arise out of the present state of Indian 
politics. The Miamies are certainly the real proprietors of 
the country south east of the Wabash, which has not been 
purchased by us (excepting the claim upon white River, 
which by the last treaty they ceded to the Delawares) they 
are pressed by the neighbouring Tribes to give up this ex- 
clusive claim but knowing its value nothing but fear will 
induce them to do it. I am convinced that they (the Chiefs 
at least) had much rather commit themselves to the protec- 
tion of the United States entirely and surrender their whole 
claim for a suitable annuity, than to divide it with the neigh- 
bouring Tribes. If such a disposition really exists, shall it 
be encouraged? If the offer is made, how shall it be re- 
ceived? You will ask why is it at present necessary to de- 



 

termine at all upon the subject? why not wait for a calmer 
moment when the agitation which now exists amongst the 
Indians shall have subsided? Because I fear by such delay 
the opportunity may be entirely lost. If we wish to obtain 
the lands in question, it is our policy to support the claims of 
the Miamies and prevent the other Tribes from settling on it. 
If we do not interfere I am persuaded that the Miami must 
yield to the pressure of the other Tribes. The establishment 
of the Prophet will receive their sanction. The Wyandots 
are also forming a Town upon the Wabash and altho' their 
numbers are now small the country is so superior to their 
own that numbers will flock to it. This is indeed the land 
of promise to which all the Tribes on Lake Erie and the 
lower Lakes have directed their attention as those of the 
Mississippi have to the Osage country. I have understood 
that numbers of the six nations are in motion and at the 
councils of Brown's Town had demanded lands to settle on 
of the Indians of this country. 

I have done myself the honor to enclose herewith my ad- 
dress to the Territorial Legislature and the copy of a Law 
passed in consequence of it, and another message transmit- 
ting a letter from the late President. The latter will I am 
persuaded be received with gi'eat satisfaction. I was par- 
ticularly desirous, that the Legislature should have before 
them a complete view of the Indian afi'airs in this quarter. 
For altho' there are some points touched upon in my ad- 
dress that are entirely without their control the opinions of 
so respectable a body cannot fail to give me great support, 
if my conduct has been correct and if it has not been a fair 
opportunity was offered for investigation and selection. For 
this purpose I may have in the estimation of some persons 
sacrificed some dignity to the shrine of popularity, for as 
ever has been my practice, I invited their scrutiny to mat- 
ters which were entirely foreign to their powers. The re- 
sult was, however, a most cordial understanding and an 
unanimity which is, I believe not parralleled in the United 
States. 

The Law which is enclosed will not be efl'ectual as it re- 
lates to the sale of ardent spirits to the Indians unless a 
similar prohibition could be established in the neighbouring 
territories. Our situation in this Town will be a most dis- 
agreeable one. The Illinois Territory is separated from us 



 

only by the Wabash and the Indians will there procure as 
much whiskey as they want whilst this Town will experience 
all the inconvenience of their drunkenness. The Illinois ter- 
ritory being in the first grade of government, the Governor 
and judges can not pass any law nor adopt one without a 
precedent from one of the original states. No such precedent 
is to be found. The prohibition therefore to sell the ardent 
spirits to the Indians in that Territory must come from 
Congress. I would have sent the law which has passed here 
to Governor Edwards, that the application for a similar one 
might come from him, but I feared that the Session of Con- 
gress would nearly have expired, before it could reach the 
seat of government in this circuitous way. I must therefore 
beg leave to recommend this subject to your attention. 
I have the honor to be with great respect. Sir, 
your humble Servt.

Dr. Sir 

I received your friendly [letter] last evening, and hope 
that I may have the pleasure of hearing from you often — I 
am much obliged to you for your information, it will be of 
much advantage to me. 

I have written to you before and suppose they have reached 
you ere now, viz, I wrote or enclosed documents I do not 
recollect. 

We have no great stock of news to give you, none I sup- 
pose more than your paper regularly afford — The Gov- 
ernor [Harrison] is very unpopular here and daily becomes 
mor unpopular — 

I have received depositions and certificates with charges 
against Harrison and have shown them to several members 
of Congress and they all tell I am bound to give them their

usual course and declare he ought to out of office — His 
political career is ended. I shall lay the ground work of an 
impeachment before ten days — ' 

The above in confidence until I see you — 

From what has been written to me from every County in 
the Territory I think there is little doubt of my next election. 
But sure bind, sure find, is the best maxim, and I have writ- 
ten to several of my friends to use every proper exertion, 
because if we succeed, the Governor and his federal friends 
must go to the wall — 

This is the only struggle on our part to become quite vic- 
torious, that is necessary, and the condescension of the Gov- 
ernor is only to obtain thereby some advantage — He has 
been forced to this condescension, otherwise he would have 
been equally condescending at other times. Necessity is no 
virtue, and he who makes a virtue of necessity deserves no 
credit. 

I have thought proper to ask of my friends in Franklin & 
Wayne the favour if they feel disposed, to have a meeting 
in each County, and resolve that they will support [Jen- 
nings] at the next election as Delegate to Congress. 

I shall not mention the thing to any others but yourself 
and Mr. [John] Templeton- and Capt. [Thomas] McCoy^' and 
Capt. [Robert] Hanna.^ 

I do not wish it to be laiown as being my request it would 
be made a handle of by my enemies. But policy is necessary — 

Such a measure will have the greatest weight in Knox 

1. Dec. 21. 1810 Jennings introduced a resolution to the effect that no appointee 
of Harrison should sit in the territorial legislature. This was laid on the table without 
vote or discussion and never referred to again. So far as the A7inals show Jennings 
never "impeached" the governor. This letter is a fair sample of Jennings' statesman- 
ship. Senator Joseph Anderson of Tenn. introduced a bill to broaden the right of 
suffrage in Indiana, which became a law. This law contained a section embracing the 
substance of the Jennings resolution. How far he was instrumental in the passage 
of the law cannot be ascertained from the Annals, though it is a fair inference that 
he should have the credit. Jennings was greatly handicapped by his inability as a 
speaker. 

2. John Templeton was appointed a justice for Dearborn Co. (now Franklin) 
April 11. 1806. He was the son-in-law of Capt. Robert Hanna. He was elected to the 
territorial legislature in 1810 and by his efforts Franklin Co. was organized. His 
father Robert Templeton came with Robert Hanna from S. Car. in 1804. 

3. Thomas McCoy was a Kentuckian who settled south of Richmond in 1805. Dec. 
24. 1806 he was made a Capt. in the militia. He was an Irishman and a farmer, 
dieing on his farm near Centerville, 1845. 

4. Captain Robert Hanna was one of the earliest settlers of what is now Franklin 
Co. He came from S. Car in 1804 ; was first sheriff of his county ; a member of the 
Constitutional convention of 1816 and one of the best known men of Franklin county. 



 

County because it is reported with great industry that Ran- 
dolph will get a majority with your upper Counties — 

I shall write to the same effect to those gentlemen — I

well aversed in deception — Make my respect to Mrs. Man-

Sir: 

Having never received any directions from your depart- 
ment since the commencement of the present administration 
[Madison] with respect to the issues of provisions and occa- 
sional benefactions to the Indians, I have pursued the plan 
laid down in letter of General Instructions received from the 
late President [Jefferson] in his own hand writing, and which 
has served for my guide for me in this particular for many 
years past. If however the further extinguishment of Indian 
title should not enter into the plans of the Government, a 
retrenchment of the annual expenses of the Indian Depart- 
ment at this place might be gradually effected. At any rate 
50 or 60 dollars per annum might be saved in the article of 
Tobacco if that article were purchased by the quantity in 
Kentucky, and sent here and perhaps twice that sum by the 
employment of an armourer by the year for the Indian busi- 
ness, rather than the present mode of paying for it by the 
job. Whatever directions you may please to give me on 
these subjects shall be punctually observed. 

I have no knowledge of the present disposition of the Brit- 
ish Government towards the United States but what I gather 
from the Documents which accompanied the President's mes- 
sage to Congress but I am certain that if their intentions are 
pacifick the Indian department of Upper Canada have not . 
been made acquainted with them — for they have certainly 
(and very lately too) said everything to the Indians, who 
have visited them, to irritate them against us — excepting this 
I have heard nothing new from the Indian country. Indeed 
this is not the season for intrigue amongst them as they are

Sir: 

You were no doubt informed by the acting Govr. of Louisi- 
ana [William Clark] of the murder of four of our citizens 
last fall on the Missouri by two Potawatimies. A short time 
before Govr. [Benjamin] Howard' left St. Louis he sent me 
a number of documents relating to this subject and requested 
that I would cause the culprits to be apprehended (if as he 
had been informed they were within the limits of this [In- 
diana] Territory) and delivered up to him. My enquiries 
have at length verified the supposition that they were within 
my superintendency and that they had wintered amongst 
those of their Tribe, which inhabit the country between the 
Wabash and Lake Michigan at no great distance from the 
Prophet's Town. 

About the first of this Inst, four of the same Tribe and 
from the same place came into the settlement of Busseron 
(20 miles above this) and took from thence twelve head of 
Horses. These scoundrels I have no doubt belong to a Ban- 
ditti that were established formerly on the upper parts of 
the Illinois River [around Peoria] from whence they carried 
on the most successful depredations, under the command of 
a celebrated Chief, called Turkey-foot, who became the terror 
of all the settlements on the Mississippi and the Illinois. I 
was three years endeavouring in vain to oblige his Tribe to 
deliver him up for the murder of two Frenchmen and was 
at length oblig'd to employ a war chief of the Tribe, who was 

Ky. Representative in congress from Ky.

a friend of mine, to apprehend him. In the encounter which 
ensued Turkey-foot was killed and his scalp brought to me. 
This struck such terror in the party that they did no mis- 
chief other than that of stealing a few horses, until the mur- 
der on the Missouri. I have little expectation of their being 
given up, but I have sent [William] Wells and [John] Con- 
nor who were here as witnesses at the general court, to the 
Indian country to ascertain precisely where they are, by what 
chiefs they are protected, to endeavour to recover the stolen 
horses. 

I hold [Michael] Bruillet in readiness to go for them should 
it appear probable from Wells' report that they will be sur- 
rendered. If the murderers and thieves are not quietly given 
up I shall wait your further directions on the subject. 

I have pursued the President's directions with regard to 
the use of pacific and conciliatory measures with the Indians. 
That is I have paid more than common attention to gratify 
their little wants and to do away unfavorable impressions 
but having received no orders to the contrary, I have uni- 
formly and positively declared that the Treaty [Fort Wayne, 
1809] of which they have been made to complain would never 
be abandoned, and that we were determined to keep the land 
which we had fairly acquired of the rightful owmers even 
at the expense of as many lives as there were Trees grow- 
ing on it. I believe that this course has produced all the 
good effects which I had anticipated from it. The little Wea 
Tribe [near Lafayette] had begun last fall to give itself airs 
in imitation of, or in obedience to the directions of, the other 
Tribes. They are now all submission, and far from imposing 
any impediments to the settlements, which are at this moment 
progressing far into the new purchase, they afforded these 
adventurous citizens, all the aid in their power. But a few 
days ago the Head Chief applied to me for a writing desig- 
nating him as such and certifying his disposition to live upon 
the most friendly terms with those people who have so pre- 
maturely taken possession of that very land (the site of his 
principal village) which a few months ago, they discovered 
so much aversion to give up, after they had fairly and will- 
ingly sold it. Encroachment upon the rights and pi'operty 
of those who will not resist is a characteristic of every sav- 
age. "Sooner shall the lover stop short of the last favor (I 
use a figure of the late Presdt. Adams) "having obtained the 



 

rest" than an Indian cease to demand as long as there is a 
prospect of his demands being complied with. The unfor- 
tunate Traveller who yields his coat to Indian insolence need 
not expect that he will be able to retain his shirt. On the 
contrary (pursuing the above simile) the licentious rake is 
far more easily checked by the frowns of Indignant virtue 
than are the arrogant pretensions of an Indian, (I Speak 
from experience) when opposed by decision and manly re- 
sistance. 

I have no reason to believe that the disposition of the 
Prophet and his Brother towards us has undergone any 
change, but I do not think that he will be able to excite the 
usual disturbance this spring amongst the Indians. Finding 
that they are unable to raise a sufficient force to make war, 
and that their threats have availed them nothing I am in 
hopes that they will remain quiet. I sincerely hope however 
that the President's determination to build the Fort on the 
Wabash [Harrison] may only have been suspended not 
abandoned. The establishment of a Factory [for Indian 
trade] there also would be highly advantageous to the In- 
dians and would produce all those good effects to us, which 
have been experienced from those establishments at other 
places. I do not see Indeed how the Indians can procure 
necessaries without it, as they are precluded by the law I 
sent you from trading in the settled parts of this Territory. 

If my letters and opinions on the subject of Wells have 
appeared to you in any degree inconsistant and contradictory 
I can not say that they have not exhibited a faithful presenta- 
tion of what has passed in my mind. You will do me justice 
in believing that this has not proceeded from fickleness of 
temper or any less worthy cause but from the contradictory 
impressions which a knowledge of his superior talents for 
an appointment in the Indian Department and the fear of 
his possessing dispositions which might in some degree prove 
dangerous, have made upon me. Without troubling you again 
with observations upon his character which I have before 
frequently made I will merely mention the conclusions which 
my mind has arrived at after much reflection. Could I be 
allowed to dispose of Wells as I thought proper my first wish 
would be to place him in the Interiour of our settlements 
where he would never see and scarcely hear of an Indian. 
But as this is impossible from his being located in such a 



 

manner at Fort Wayne, that he cannot be removed without 
very considerable expence my next wish is to get him such 
an appointment as he could consider an object where he might 
be used to advantage but at the same time so limitted as to 
prevent his doing mischief. I sincerely believe that he would 
now be faithful. His activity and talents need not be doubted. 
The arrangement which I should recommend would be that 
there should be no principal agent that Wells should be sub- 
agent for the Miamies and Eel River Tribes, or if it was 
thought improper to give him that title he might be called 
Interpreter — Mr. [John] Shaw Sub-agent for the Potawati- 
mies and Conner for the Delawares. The Salary of each to 
be 550 or 600$. The annuities to be delivered by the Factor 
and all payments to be made by him. The three to report 
separately and individually to the Governor. 

The additional expence (fixing the salaries at $600) would 
be but about $600 in the whole which is much less than a 
principal agent could be got for — Wells would gladly accept 
of such an appointment and Shaw and Connor have sei'ved so 
faithfully that they deserve some little advance. Indeed upon 
general principles such promotions are always promotive of 
public service. 

I believe that I did myself the favor to inform you last fall 
that I had commenced a suit against a certain Wm. Mcintosh 
a Scotchman residing at this place, for slandering me in rela- 
tion to my management of the Indian Department. The ac- 
cusations which he brought against me were of the most seri- 
ous nature. "Such as defrauding the Indians in the Treaties 
I have made with them. Making chiefs to answer my own 
particular purposes. Excluding the real chiefs. By this and 
the conduct producing all the disturbances which have taken 
place in the Indian country, and the alarm produced in this 
etc." This suit was tried in the Superior Court of this Ter- 
ritory on the 11th inst. A short report of it will be published 
and I will do myself the Honor to send you a copy. Suffice 
it at present to say that no defendant in a case of that kind 
ever allowed so much latitude as my opponent was, by my par-

justificatory evidence was allowed with regard to the points 
at issue but he was allowed to bring forward testimony totally 
irrelevant to it, in fact every part of my conduct and admin-

after twenty-five witnesses were examined, the rascally calum-

are two brothers of the wife of Main Poc' He is residing

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 6th June 1811 

Har. Pa. 389-109 

Sir: 

I have delayed writing to you since the 23rd of April under 
the expectation of being able to give you a correct view of 
the course which Indian politics was about to take this sum- 
mer. In this however I am disappointed and I am sorry to 
say that what I have learned is by no means indicative of a 
pacific disposition. [William] Wells made a report to me 
from Fort Wayne of his proceedings at the Prophet's Towti 
relative to the stolen horses he was in search of, and the 
Potawatomies who committed the murders on the Missourie, 
Four of the Horses were delivered up. Tecumseh and the 
Prophet both disclaimed having any agency in taking them, 
altho they acknowledged that it was done by the part of the 
Potawatomie tribe which are under their influence. They 
promised to procure the rest and send them in — this how- 
ever they have not done and we have every reason to believe 
that others have since been taken. 

The murderers were said to have been removed from that 
part of the country and gone to reside on the Illinois River. 
[William] Wells did not make a formal demand of them but 
he was informed that they would not be delivered up. He 
(Wells) had much conversation with Tecumseh, and he says 
that the latter openly and positively avowed his determina- 
tion to resist the encroachments of the white people. Upon 
Wells observing that he would never be able to accomplish 
his intentions he declared that Wells would live to see the 
contrary. About five weeks ago a Kickapoo chief who had 
an excellent character came to me of his owai accord and told 
me that as I had always treated him with kindness he had 
determined to put me upon my guard against the Prophet 
and his brother. He said that their pacific professions were 
not to be relied upon that he had heard them speaking to 
the Indians for several years and in that time he had never 
heard anything that they said but war and hatred against 
the United States. That the delivery up of the Horses which 
were occasionally stolen was merely intended to lull our 
vigilance and to prevent us from discovering their designs 
until they were ripe for execution. That they frequently told 



 

their young men that they would defeat their plans by their 
precipitancy. That in their harangues to the Indians they 
frequently requested those who would not join their con- 
federacy to keep their secrets That he always promised them 
a rich harvest of plunder and scalps, declaring that the first 
stroke would put them in possession of an ample supply of 
arms, ammunition and provisions. 

On the 2nd of May General William Clarke^ of Saint Louis 
wrote to me informing that the Prophet had sent a Belt to 
the Mississippi tribes inviting them to war against us, and 
declaring that his intention was to begin the war by an attack 
on theis place. I received a letter from [John] La Lime the 
Interpreter at Chicago at the same time in which he says 
that he had ascertained that the Indians in that quarter had 
actually determined on going to war. When General Clark 
wrote the above letter he was of opinion that none of the 
tribes on the Mississippi would accept the Belt. 

By the last mail however he informed me in a letter of the 
23rd ultimo that the Sacks have absolutely acceded to the 
hostile confederacy and that a part of them had gone to De- 
troit, no doubt to get annuities. 

One of the surveyors who was employed by the Surveyor 
Genl. to divide the new purchase into Townships has been 
frightened off by the Weas. They took two of his men who 
were in advance making preparations to cross the Wabash 
prisoners, took from them a rifle and some other articles and 
kept them tied up all night, they were however released the 
next day and the Indians declared that they took them for 
deserters from the Garrison near the place. The surveyor 
was however so frightened that he immediately pushed off to 
Cincinnati without coming to this place. I am still unable 
to determine whether I should consider this transaction as 
a hostile act on the part of the Indians or not. I have some 
reason to believe the the surveyor found it very convenient 
to postpone his work till fall from the great difficulty of 
surveying at this season, and I am convinced that the Weas 
would not have dared to interrupt him if they had not been 
encouraged to do so, and assured of the support from above.

Those that I have seen declare that they had no intention of 
stopping the surveyor. On the other hand some threats which 
they have incautiously droped amongst the settlers on the 
frontiers incline me to believe that the seizing the men was 
intended to feel our pulse and connected with other circum- 
stances is at least calculated to excite strong suspicions. 
About eight or ten days ago a war party consisting of ten 
men came to a House on Shoal Creek fifteen miles from Ca- 
hokia murdered a young man and took a young woman pris- 
oner, this information was brought by two respectable looking 
travelers on Thursday last and is confirmed by two others 
(one of whom I know) who arrived on Saturday.- There 
is no doubt of the fact, that that it was done by the Pota- 
watomies of the Illinois River. The murderers were pur- 
sued by a detachment of thirty militia. [Michael] Bi'ouillette 
is now at the Prophets Town. I have not heard from him 
since he went from hence but expect him in a few days. 

Concieving it to be all important to procure correct intel- 
ligence I have employed a Mr. [John Baptist] Leplante^ who 
has resided many years with the Potawatimies at the very 
Site of the Prophets Town to take Brouillettes^ place, and 
have recalled the latter. Brouillete is too well known to be 
in the service of the Government to do much good and I am

to be Pottawattomies attacked a family 30 miles south-east of Cahokia. Father and

Capt. Whitesides. Girl found tomahawked. Killed two Indians but had to return for

Cin. Liberty Hall. July 3. 1811 
"Some few murders were committed on our frontiers before war was declared. On 
June 2. 1811. a family of the name of Cox resided on Shoal Creek. [111.] near the forks. 
and the Indians discovered the family from home, except a young man and woman. 
They killed the young man mangled his body cruelly. The girl they took prisoner and 
also took several horses. Col. Fruit acting as captain, Heni-y Cox, Ben Cox. and some 
others, to the number of eight or ten men pursued the Indians and overtook them 
and the girl about seven miles from their town and fifty miles north of Springfield. 
A kind of bashful fight ensued. In the scramble the girl broke from the Indians toward 
the whites, and as she ran. an Indian wounded her severely in the hip. by throwing 
a tomahawk at her. The whites got some of the stolen horses and the girl. They 
reached home in safety."

moreover not satisfied with some part of his conduct, I ex- 
pect much advantage from the employment of Laplante. 
French men Hke him who speak no english and who have 
always been engaged in the Indian trade are not considered 
by the Indians as much attached to the American Govern- 
ment indeed very few of them are so. This man is I believe 
entirely worthy of confidence. I dispatched ten days a go a 
Perogue with the anuity Salt for the Indians. I directed a 
pax't of it to be offered to the prophet. 

I wish I could say the Indians were treated with justice 
and propriety on all occasions by our own citizens but it is 
far otherwise. They are often abused and maltreated and 
it is very rare that they obtain any satisfaction for the most 
unprovoked wrongs. 

Since my letter of the 23rd of April a Muscoe Indian was 
killed by an Italian Innkeeper [Laurent Bazadone] inthisplace. 
The Indian came into his yard drunk and perhaps was insolent, 
he was however entirely unarmed, nor did there appear the 
least necessity for killing him. He was shot in the Abdomen 
with large Duck Shot and expired immediately. I imme- 
diately caused the perpetrator to be apprehended and or- 
dered a special court for his trial, he was however acquitted 
by the jury almost without deliberation. The friends of the 
deceased were much exasperated. In some degree to quiet 
them I made them a present of about seventy dollars worth 
of goods. Since the above two Weas were badly wounded by 
a white man about twenty miles from hence. I sent out a 
surgeon to their relief and they are both in a fair way to 
recover. Such instances (and the latter was if possible more 
unprovoked than the former) have a great tendency to ex- 
asperate the Indians, and prevent them from delivering up 
those of their ti'ibes who may commit offences against our 
laws. 

Such was the case with the Delaware Tribe upon my de- 
mand of White Turkey a Delaware who robbed a house of 
Mr. Vawter' of this territory, the chief declared they would 
never deliver up another man until some of the white per- 
sons were punished who had murdered their people, they 
would however punish him themselves and did accordingly 
put him to death. 

5. James. John and William Vawter were early settlers near Madison in what was 
thun Clark county. They were commissioned for various offices by Gen. Harrison.

I have the honor to enclose herewith Mr. Vawter's account 
of the articles stolen by the White Turkey with their valu- 
ation for which the U. S. have promised indemnification most 
of those were recovered by Mr. [John] Conner and taken to 
Fort Wayne, were deposited in a weare House, which was 
broken open and the whole of them again stolen. The Dela- 
ware chiefs have refused to pay for them alledging that they 
have done all that was required of them by their treaty in 
punishing the thief and delivering up such of the articles as 
could be procured. Mr. Vawter is very urgent for compen- 
sation and I must request your decision on the case. 

I have received seventy pairs of pistols and the like num- 
ber of swords from the Arsenal at Newport, they are hand- 
somly finished but I am told by those who have examined 
them that the swords are certainly made of Iron and that 
not of the harder quality. They may answer to attack the 
naked scull of a Savage but would have little effect on the 
iron helmet of a Marmaluke or even the leathern cap of a 
. British Dragoon, Major [Thomas] Martin" has infonned me 
that he has no rifles. Our Militia are extremely awkward 
with the Musket and cannot be brought under the present 
mode of training to alter their sentiments respecting it. I 
should be much pleased to get about five hundred rifles. An 
ofiicer of the Militia has invented a mode of loading arm 
which does away any objection to its use. His plan is to 
have cartridge bands of leather to buckle in front like those 
formerly used by the light Infantry. The cartridges are tin 
Julies holding exactly a charge of powder with the ball, and 
patch placed on the tops. The lower orifice of the Tube is 
closed with a wooden stopper which is easily removed and 
to prevent being lost is attached to the tube by a string, 
when drawn out to be used the cartridge is reversed, the ball 
is secured by the palm of the hand, the stopper removed with 
the teeth, the gun primed, the place of the stopper supplied 
by the finger until the tube is replaced in the muzzle of the 
Gun with the right hand, the ball and patch being at the 
same time removed with the left and placed in the proper 
position to be forced down with the ramrod the right hand 
in the mean time conveys the tube to the pouch or pocket or 
in great urgency it is droped on the ground. I have seen

the inventor load and fire his rifle with the aid of these 
Tubes, and I am satisfied he will at least load one third 
oftener than any pei-son can do in the common way the man 
is poor and wishes to know whether the Government will give

P. S. The carrier of the Illinois Mail (who has just ar- 
rived) informs us that the woman taken by the party of In- 
dians was recovered by the Militia who were in pursuit of 
them. The Indians finding that they were likely to be over- 
taken abandoned her after attempting to tomahawk her, 
which their huriy prevented them from effecting. The post 
rider also says that two Indians were killed by the White 
people in the neighborhood of the place where the woman 
was taken from, a few days ago and that the whole country 
is in alarm and getting into Forts as fast as possible. I have 
not made the least attempt to put this country in a state of 
defence and shall not do any thing until every doubt of the 
Hostile designs of the Indians is removed from the unfavor- 
able eff"ect produced by these alarms upon the emigration 
and the injury that the frontier people would sustain by the 
abandonment of their crops. If the afi'air in Illinois is actu- 
ally the commencement of general hostilities Many families 
will be butchered nor will anything but the want of resolu- 
tion to undertake to prevent this and other Towns from 
being sacked.

Sir: 

I informed you in my last that I had sent a Perogue up the 
Wabash with the annuity salt for the Indians. The perogue re- 
turned last evening. The person who had charge of her in- 
formed me that he was stopped by the Prophet and the whole 
of the salt taken from him, I had directed him to put out five 
barrels at the Prophets Town two for the Kickapoos and three 
for the Shawnees and other Indians. The Prophet informed 
[Michael] Brouillette who left the town the day before the 
arrival of the salt that he would accept none of it. When it 
arrived, however he immediately called a council and the re- 
sult of their deliberations was that the whole should be seized 
which was done accordingly. He directed the men to tell me 
not to be angry at his seizing th6 salt as he had got none the 
last year and had more than two thousand men to feed. [John 
B.] La Plante (the person whom I mentioned to have sent up 
in my last by the Perogue) informed me that there are about 
a hundred men and that Tecumseh is daily expected with a 
considerable reinforcement from the lakes. 

From all I can collect I have not the least doubt but a crisis 
with this fellow is approaching — His determination is, and 
(I have my information from so many different sources that 
it is impossible to disbelieve it) to come to this place with 
as many men as he can raise and if the land which was lately 
purchased is not immediately given up to commence the war. 

I am really very much at a loss how to proceed. To sit 
still and suffer this scoundrel to come into this town with six 
or eight hundred men without having an adequate force to 
oppose him does not appear to me to be proper and yet I am 
certain he will come and equally so of his bad intentions. The 
whole force I could collect for many miles, would not equal 
his number. And at this season of the year it is ruinous to 
the Citizens to leave their farms nor would they be willing to 
abandon their wives and children. I shall endeavour to 
temporize with him until I can receive your orders. Permit 
me to recommend that the troops now at Pittsburgh may be 
ordered here immediately and that offensive measures be 
authorized against the Prophet as soon as it is ascertained that 
he is decidedly hostile. For my own part I am so satisfied of 



 

his intentions that if I had any discretion on the subject I 
would attack him on his way hither with any force that I 
could collect. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir 
your Huble. Servt.

Harrison to Clark 

ViNCENNES, 19th June, 1811 
Andreas, Cook County, 77 

Dear Sir: I have been exerting myself to find out where 
the Pottawatomies who murdered Captain Cole' and his party 
wei'e to be found and the best means of apprehending them, 
for some months past. I will now give you the result of my 
inquiries on the subject. The chiefs of the Pottawatomies all 
acknowledge that the murderers belong to their tribe. Sev- 
eral of the principal ones were at Fort Wayne early this 
spring, and informed Captain [William] Wells that they had 
put themselves under the protection of Main Poc, the great 
war chief of the tribe, who resides upon the Illinois River. 
One of these, however, spent the last winter with the Prophet. 
I sent Wells up to the town of the latter in April last, to ascer- 
tain whether they were there and what would be the most 
likely means of getting hold of them, and four others of the 
same tribe, who had in the beginning of that month stolen 
fourteen horses from this neighborhood. In his I'eport Wells 
informed me that the murderers were not there; that they 
lived on the Illinois River and were only occasionally on the 
Wabash. I would immediately have communicated this infor- 

1. Captain Cole, settled about the mouth of the Gasconade river, Missouri. Mur- 
dered by Indians in July, 1810. 

"In July 1810, the Pottawatomies of the Illinois made a raid upon a settlement 
in Missouri, opposite the mouth of the Gasconade, stealing property and murdering 
several settlers, amont: whom was Captain Cole. The Governor of Missouri (General 
William Clark) made a requisition upon Governor Ninian Edwards of Illinois, for the 
murderers. They had taken refuge with Main Poc, the war chief of the tribe, then 
residing near Peoria Lake, but whose village was on the Kankakee, just above the forks." 
Andreas, History of Cook County, III, 77 



 

matioii to you, but as I still had a man at the Prophet's village, 
I waited his return to know whether he would bring any fur- 
ther intelligence. A few days ago he arrived, and with him 
a young Indian, who formerly lived with me, and who is the 
son-in-law of Onoxa of Five Medals, a principal Pottawatomie 
chief. Onoxa desired the young man to inform me that there 
was no probability of the murderers being delivered up, and 
that there was no way of getting them but by sending a party 
of men and taking them wherever they would be found. 
[Michael] Brouilette, the young man above mentioned, says 
that a Pottawatomie was at the Prophet's town when he left 
it, with one of the horses taken from Cole, but he does not 
know whether he was one of the party that took him. I have 
on the 23d April written to the Secretary of War for partic- 
ular instruction on the subject of these fellows, but have not 
yet received an answer. I think, however that a formal de- 
mand had better be made of Main Poc by Governor Edwards, 
as they are certainly within his jurisdiction, and I will cause 
the same thing to be done of the chiefs who attend at Post 
Wayne to receive their annuity. There is not, however, the 
smallest probability of their being surrendered. I have no 
doubt of the good disposition of Tupennibe,- the principal 
chief of the tribe, Onoxa and many others, but the tribe is so 
large and scattered that they have no control over the distant 
parts, indeed very little over the young men that are about 
them. I am therefore certain that there is no other mode of 
bringing the culprits to justice but by seizing them ourselves. 
All the information that I receive from the Indian country 
confirms the rooted enmity of the Prophet to the U. S. and his 
determination to commence hostilities as soon as he thinks 
himself sufficiently strong. From the uncommon insolence 
which he and his party have lately manifested, I am inclined 
to believe that a crisis is fast approaching. A Frenchman 
descending the Wabash about ten days ago was robbed of his 
piroque and some small quantity of goods; but the most dar- 
ing piece of insolence that they have yet ventured upon is that 
of seizing the salt destined for the tribes above them. The 
piroque which I sent up with it returned last evening and the

man who had charge of her reports that he stopped at the 
Prophet's village and offered him three barrels of salt intended 
for him, and that he was ordered to stop until a council was 
held and the wole was then taken from him. If our govern- 
ment will submit to this insolence, it will be the means of mak- 
ing all the tribes treat us with contempt. 

I do not recollect anything of the claim of Briam which you 
mention in your last. I may perhaps have received the papers 
and sent them to Fort Wayne but I have forgotten it. I will 
thank you to state the particulars.

Brothers, 

Listen to me, I speak to you about matters of importance, 
both to the white people and yourselves ; open your ears, there- 
fore, and attend to what I shall say. 

Brothers, this is the third year that all the white people in 
this country have been alarmed at your proceedings, you 
threaten us with war, you invite all the tribes to the north and 
west of you to join against us. 

Brothers, your warriors who have lately been here, deny 
this; but I have received the information from every direc- 
tion; the tribes on the Mississippi have sent me word that 



 

you intended to murder me, and then to commence a war upon 
our people. I have also received the speech that you sent to 
the Potawatamies and others, to join you for that purpose; 
but if I had no other evidence of your hostility to us, your 
seizing the salt which I lately sent up the Wabash is sufficient. 

Brothers, our citizens are alarmed, and my warriors are 
preparing themselves ; not to strike you, but to defend them- 
selves and their women and children. You shall not surprise 
us as you expect to do; you are about to undertake a very rash 
act ; as a friend, I advise you to consider well of it ; a little re- 
flection may save us a great a deal of trouble, and prevent 
much mischief ; it is not yet too late. 

Brothers, what can be the inducement for you to undertake 
an enterprise where there is so little probability of success ; do 
you really think that the handful of men that you have about 
you are able to contend with the power of the Seventeen Fires, 
or even that the whole of the tribes united could contend 
against the Kentucky Fire alone. 

Brothers, I am myself of the long knife fire; as soon as they 
hear my voice, you will see them pouring forth their swarms 
of hunting-shirt men, as numerous as the musquitoes on the 
shores of the Wabash, brothers, take care of their stings. 

Brothers, it is not our wish to hurt you ; if we did, we cer- 
tainly have power to do it ; look at the number of our warriors 
to the east of you, above and below the Great Miami, to the 
south, on both sides of the Ohio and below you also. You are 
brave men, but what could you do against such a multitude; 
but we wish you to live in peace and happiness. 

Brothers, the citizens of this country are alarmed, they must 
be satisfied that you have no design to do them mischief, or 
they will not lay aside their arms. You have also insulted the 
government of the United States, by seizing the salt that was 
intended for the other tribes; saisf action must be given for 
that also. 

Brothers, you talk of coming to see me, attended by all your 
young men ; this, however, must not be so, if your intentions 
are good, you have no need to bring but a few of your young 
men with you. I must be plain with you ; I will not suffer you 
to come into our settlements with such a force. 

Brothers, if you wish to satisfy us that your intentions are 
good, follow the advice that I have given you before; that 
is, that one or both of you should visit the President of the 



 

United States, and lay your grievances before him. He will 
treat you well, will listen to what you say, and if you can 
shew him that you have been injured, you will receive justice. 
If you will follow my advice in this respect, it will convince 
the citizens of this country and myself that you have no design 
to attack them. 

Brothers, with respect to the lands that were purchased last 
fall, I can enter into no negotiation with you on the subject; 
the affair is in the hands of the President, if you wish to go 
and see him, I will supply you with the means. 

Brothers, the person who delivers this, [Walter Wilson] is 
one of my war officers; he is a man in whom I have entire 
confidence, whatever he says to you, although it may not be 
contained in this paper, you may believe comes from me. 

My Friend, Tecumseh, the bearer is a good man and a brave 
warrior; I hope you will treat him well, you are yourself a 
warrior and all such should have an esteem for each other.

Sir: 

The Illinois Mail has this moment arrived its failure last 
week was occasioned by the foundering of his horse. No new 
occurrence had taken place to excite apprehensions of the In- 
dians in that quarter after the murder of the man and capture 
of the woman mentioned in my last. Nothing of moment has 
occurred here. Several minor circumstances however 
strengthen my opinion of the designed hostility of the Prophet. 
Five Shawnees and ten Winebagos of his party arrived here 
on friday last. They came as they said for the purpose of 
delivering some peltries to a trader of the Town to whom the 
Prophet was indebted, to get a number of arms repaired 
(rifles and Tomhawks) a small part of these were left with 
the Shaker Society and the ballance brought to me. I could 
have no motive to conceal from them the information I had 
received of the hostile designs of the Prophet and I there- 
fore without reserve disclosed to them the particulars and the 
impressions it had made upon me and fortunately refused to 
have any of their arms mended or to supply them with any 



 

article that could be used as an instrument of War. They 
received this declaration with great sulkiness and denied the 
truth of the information I had received. A few traps and 
hoes which I had offered to repair for them (that had been 
taken to the smiths for that purpose) they took away with 
much ill humor and even told the Interpreter that their chiefs 
would soon settle the matter with them. The next day how- 
ever they thought proper to relax their austerity. They paid 
me a visit and with much aparent sincerity acknowledged the 
propriety of my conduct. A party of Potawatimies who are 
under the immediate influence of the Great Chief Tobinebe 
(who has always been our friend) was then in the Town. 
Meeting with the Shawnes they upbraided them severely with 
their intended hostility against their father and charged them 
with having come for the purpose of examining our situation. 
The principal of the Shawanees was so frightened at the 
menaces of the Potawatimi that he hid himself for some hours. 
Nothing but the great talents of Tecumseh could keep together 
the heterogeneous mass which conposes the Prophet's force. 
I have sent up a militia officer [Walter Wilson] to their towns 
to demand an explanation of them and to tell them that I will 
not permit them with any considerable force to come into our 
settlements. [June 24, above] I have also taken care to en- 
deavour to impress them with an opinion that we are prepared 
for them and that a considerable auxiliary force is in readi- 
ness in Kentucky to march across to the Wabash and inter- 
cept their return should they descend that river with hostile 
intentions. 

It is with the deepest regret that I have to inform you of 
the death of Lieut. [Jesse] Jennings by the hand of Capt. 
[Thornton] Posey. They were alone in the room of the latter. 
The circumstances which are known are infinitely shocking 
and I fear that if viewed in the most favorable light for the 
Captain they are such as to attach an imputation upon his 
character which he will never be able to wipe off if indeed he 
should escape an ignominous death. I will do myself the honor 
by this next mail to give you the particulars of the transaction 
as they were developed on the Coroner's inquest. Captain 
Posey has made his escape and took with him a sergeant of his 
company. 

The only officer remaining in the garrison is Lieut. [Jacob 



 

W.] Albright.' His military experience does not suit him for 
such a command. I would prefer Lieut. [Ambrose] Whitlock 
to any other that I know in the army. Captain Posey wrote 
to you after the perpetration of the above fatal affair which 
happened on the night of the 23rd inst. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir 
Your Humble Servant

Sir: 

I have this moment received a dispatch from Governor 
[Ninian] Edwards by a militia Captain with a command of 
twenty men who also brought letters addressed to you which 
have been deposited in the post office of this town. By these 
you will be informed of some unpleasant events which have 
happened in the Illinois Country and I am sorry to add to the 
rest of these by communicating the intelligence which I re- 
ceived on Sunday evening of the massacre of three whole fam- 
ilies in that Territory about one hundred and twenty miles 
west of this place and fifty from Kaskaskias. Governor Ed- 
wards had received no account of this distressing affair when 
his express came off. I have not the least reason to doubt 
the accuracy of the account. There are some grounds for 
supposing that it was perpetrated by a party of five Shaw- 
aneses. I was informed four weeks ago that it was the in- 
tention of the Prophet to commence hostilities in the Illinois 
in order to cover his principal object which was an attack 
upon this place. These events, Sir, require no comment from 
me. They merit and will no doubt receive the immediate at- 
tention of the Government. If some decisive measures are 
not speedily adopted we shall have a general combination of 
all the Tribes against us. At present a majority with all the 
best informed chiefs are for peace but every scalp taken from 
us with impunity will add to the number of the hostile party.

HARRISON: MESSAGES AND LETTERS S^T" 

Can the President want any fuither proof of the Prophet's 
designs against us? I can assure you Sir that there is not an 
Indian excepting those of his party that does not know and 
acknowledge when asked that he is determined to attack us, 
and wonder at our forbearance. Governor Edwards is pre- 
paring to erect a chain of block houses around his frontiers. 
The people there are in great alarm and have talked of col- 
lecting in sections. I have not advised it at present because 
of its ruinous consequences to the crops both of com and 
wheat at this critical season. Indeed it is a plan which affords 
at best but a partial security. There is no safety in any de- 
fensive measures. I have taken the liberty on former occa- 
sions to express my opinions so fully on the subject that it 
would be presumption to repeat them. I think it however my 
duty to observe that the minds of the people have become so 
irritated in consequence of the depredations which they con- 
stantly suffer from the Prophet's party that unless measures 
are speedily taken to ensure their own safety and the safety 
of their property they will fall upon the Indians indiscrim- 
inately wherever they meet them and punish the innocent with 
the guilty. I believe that no two days pass over without 
some horses being stolen. I have hitherto prevented the thieves 
from being pursued knowing that it would inevitably lead to 
hostilities. In a letter from Genl. William Clark to Governor 
Edwards of the 2nd ult. he sayd that the design of the Prophet 
as he has collected from different sources is "to make some 
grand stroke as soon as he has collected a sufficient force". 
This I have long known as well as that this place is his object. 
I am also pursuaded that the murders lately committed in the 
Illinois were in consequence of his directions. Tecumseh has 
returned to his village but did not bring with him the Iriquois 
and Wyandots, whom he expected to prevail upon to join him. 
He says that they are to come on in September. It is probable 
that this failure will cause a postponement of the contemplated 
attack until the roasting-ear season. 

In my last I informed you of Capt. [Thornton] Posey having 
killed Lieut. [Jesse] Jennings. The Commissary of the Gar- 
rison gives the following account of the affair, viz: that he 
was sitting in his room in company with another person and 
he heard a noise resembling the report of a pistol and in a few 
seconds another, that upon looking out at the window he saw 
that Lieut. Jennings had fallen out of the Door of Captain 



 

Posey's Quarters apparently dead, that upon going up to him 
with others he was at first told by the Capt. to stand off — 
but in a little time the latter asked him to come in, upon his 
asking for an explanation of the scene before him he said 
that Lieut. Jennings had come into his room, that some alter- 
cation had taken place between them, that he had insisted upon 
the Lieut, fighting him and had offered him the choice of 
pistols, that he had put one of them into the Lieut.'s hand and 
that the latter instantly seized him by the neck or breast when 
he (the Capt.) shot him, upon being asked how he came to 
shoot him the second time he said that he could not account 
for it but supposed that Jennings had dropped his pistol and 
that he had taken it up. Jennings received one ball in his 
right breast which passed through his body and other behind 
the left shoulder which ranged along his back and came out 
at the right shoulder, his clothes both behind and before were 
burned with the powder. Jennings was certainly entirely un- 
armed when he went into the Captain's room. It is equally 
certain that the Captain told two persons two days before 
the fatal affair that he expected that Jennings meant to as- 
sassinate him and that he had been twice to his room door in 
the night, he believed for that purpose. I am told also that 
Mr. J .... s. told two different persons some time before that 
he would kill the Captain if he could. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir 
your Hble. Servt.

All the information received from the Indian country, con- 
firms the rooted enmity of the Prophet to the United States, 
and his determination to commence hostilities as soon as he 
thinks himself sufficiently strong. His party is increasing, 
and from the insolence which himself and party have lately 
manifested, and the violence which has lately been committed 
by his neighbors and friends, the Pattawatamies, on our fron- 



 

tiers, I am inclined to believe that the crisis is fast approach- 
ing. 

A number of horses have been taken from the Mississippi, 
by Pattawatamies, Winnebagoes, and others, under the in- 
fluence of the Prophet. [Extract]

Brother, 

I give you a few words until I will be with you myself. 

Brother, at Vincennes, I wish you to listen to me whilst I 
send you a few words, and I hope that they will ease your 
heart ; I know you look on your young men and your women 
and children with pity, to see them so much alarmed. 

Brother, I wish you now to examine what you have from 
me, I hope that it will be a satisfaction to you, if your in- 
tentions are like mine, to wash away all these bad stories 
that have been circulated. I will be with you myself in 
eighteen days from this day. 

Brother, we cannot say what will become of us, as the 
Great Spirit has the management of us at his will. I may 
be there before the time, and may not be there until the day. 
I hope that when we come together, all these bad tales will 
be settled ; by this I hope your young men, women, and chil- 
dren vdll be easy. I wish you, brother, to let them know 
when I come to Vincennes and see you, all will be settled in 
peace and happiness. 

Brother, these are only a few words to let you know that 
I will be with you myself, and when I am with you, I can 
inform you better. 

Brother, If I find that I can be with you in less time than 
eighteen days, I will send one of my young men before me, 
to let you know what time I will be with you.'

1. This is the answer brought back by Capt. Walter Wilson to the letter of

tained to the best of hia ability. No evidence of hostility was shown.

Edwards to Secretary of War 

Illinois Territory, July (Jth, 1811 

Am. Sta. Pa. Indian Affairs I, SOO 

An express has been received, with information of several 
other murders having been committed by the Indians on the 
frontiers. In fact, I consider peace as totally out of the ques- 
tion; we need not expect it till the Prophet's party is dis- 
persed, and the bands of Pattawatamies about the Illinois 
river are cut off. 

Hostility, with them, has grown into a habit; there is no 
reason to believe that they will make sufficient satisfaction 
for the murders they committed, and the goods and horses 
which they stole last year, or for the very aggravated and 
increased instances of similar hostilities in the present year. 
Energetic measui'es would lessen liis power of fonning coali- 
tions with other tribes, but we have not the power of taking 
any efficient means to arrest his progress ; if we do not make 
preparation to meet him, an attack is certain; if we make 
preparation formidable enough to deter him, though no war 
actually take place, we have to encounter all the expense, 
inconvenience, and injury to which a war with him would 
subject us; and there seems to be no reasonable ground to 
hope for a change for the better, whilst he is permitted to 
increase his strength with impunity. [Extract]

The first news we received was that the brothers-in-law of

information that the Indians about that place have been about the settlements of 



 

cause of it, or in part, is from the Little Chief that came 
last fall to see Governor Harrison, under the feigned name 
of Wapewa. He told the Indians that he had told the Gov- 
ernor that the Americans were settling on their lands, and 
asked him what should be done with them. He told the In- 
dians that the Governor had told them they were bad people, 
that they must drive them off, kill their cattle and steal their 
horses, etc. Being the quarter ending with the 30th of June, 
I am busy with the factory and have a number of Indians

Sir: 

From the Illinois Post rider who has just arrived I learn 
that but one of the three families which were supposed to 
be murdered as mentioned in my letter of the 3rd Inst, have 
really suffered, the other two were fortunate enough to make 
their escape into the settlement. Should any murder be com- 
mitted upon any of our citizens in this neighbourhood we 
should be placed in a most disagreeable situation on account 
of the friendly Tribes of Weas and Piankeshaws and Dela- 
wares. They (the Weas Particularly) are very much mixed 
in with our settlements and it would be absolutely impos- 
sible to distinguish them in many instances from the hostile 
Indians. I know of no other mode of saving them but by 
removing the Weas considerably into the settled country and 

Kaskaskia and Vincennes. and have stolen from fifteen to twenty horses. It appears 
by the information given me that the principal actors are two brothers of the wife 
of Main Poc. He is residing at the Peorias, or a little above it, at a place they call 
Prairie du Corbeau. By the express going to Fort Wayne, I will communicate this 
to the agent. I presume. Sir, that you will communicate this to the Governor of 
Kaskaskia and to General Harrison. 

I am, Sir. with respect. Hble. Servt.

supporting them. The Delawares might be confined to their 
towns which are placed in a favorable situation for that pur- 
pose. In case of open war some of the Miamis and friendly 
Potawatimies those of the latter which are attached to us 
are sincerely so. I have supposed that if the Prophet does 
not immediately throw off the mask and commence the war 
that calamity might be avoided by marching a considerable 
force up to our exterior boundary up the Wabash and re- 
quiring the immediate dispersion of the Banditti he has col- 
lected. This measure would give confidence to our friends, 
confii-m the wavering (if any yet waver) in favour of peace 
and perhaps break up the confederacy. 

If no appointment of surgeons mate for this garrison has 
been made permit me to request that post for Doctor Edward 
Sculp of this place. Dr. S. is 24 or 5 years of age, of re- 
spectable connexions has received a regular classical educa- 
tion at Princeton then commenced the study of medicine in 
Pittsburgh under Dr. Stevenson and finally finished his studies 
by attending the medical lectures in Philadelphia. He is a 
young man of good moral character, attentive to his profes- 
sion and professed, as I sincerely believe, of his common skill 
for his experience. 

Certificates of his regular Education will be forwarded to 
you.

Sir: 

Captain [Walter] Wilson the officer whom I sent to the 
Prophets Towai returned on Sunday last. He was well re- 
ceived and treated with particular friendship by Tecumseh. 
He obtained however no satisfaction. The only answer given 

1. Dr. Edward Scull was appointed surgeon for the volunteer troops on the Tippe- 
canoe campaign. He was transferred to the 19th U. S. Inf. Apr. 8, 1814. Died Nov. 
28, 1815. He was from Penn. June 4. 1812 he was appointed surgeon for the First 
regiment Ind. Militia. In 1813 he killed Parmenas Beckes in 8 duel. 



 

was that in 10 days Tecumseh would pay me a visit for the 
purpose of explaining- his conduct. Upon being told that I 
would not suffer him to come with a large force, he promised 
to bring with him a few men only. I shall not however de- 
pend upon this promise, but shall have the river well watched 
by a party of scouts after the descent of the Chief lest he 
should be followed by his warriors. I do not think that this 
will be the case. The detection of the hostile designs of an 
Indian is generally for that time to defeat them. The hopes 
of an expedition, conducted through many hundred of miles 
of toil and difficulty are abandoned frequently, upon the 
slightest suspicion of discovery, their painful steps retraced 
and a more favorable moment expected. With them the sur- 
prise of an enemy bestows more eclat upon a warrior than 
the most brilliant success obtained by other means. Tecumseh 
has taken for his model the celebrated Pontiac and I am per- 
suaded that he will bear a favourable comparison in every 
respect with that far-famed warrior. If it is his object to 
begin with the surprise of this place, it is impossible that a 
more favourable situation could have been chosen than the 
one he occupies. It is just so far off as to be removed from 
our immediate observation and yet so near as to enable him 
to strike us when the water is high in 24 hours and even 
when it is low their light canoes will come fully as fast as 
the journey could be performed on horse back. The situation 
is in other respects admirable for the purposes for which he 
has chosen it. It is nearly central with regard to the Tribes 
which he wishes to unite. The water communication with 
Lake Erie by means of the Wabash and Miami, with Lake 
Michigan and the Illinois by the Tippecanoe is a great con- 
venience. It is immediately in the centre of the back line 
of that fine country which he wishes to prevent us from set- 
tling and above all he has immediately in his rear a country 
that has been but little explored consisting principally of 
barren thickets interspersed with swamps and Lakes into 
which our cavalry could not penetrate and our Infantry only 
by slow and laborious efforts. 

I have some reason to believe that the information I have 
given and the opinions I have expressed on the subject of 
the Prophet and his intentions have been considered by some 
of the members of the Government as premature and un- 
founded. This has not however prevented me from continu- 



 

ing to communicate all the intelligence I receive with such 
observations as my local situation enabled me to make and 
I shall continue to do untill I am directed to do otherwise. 
I know that the President is too just to censure an officer 
for unintentional error or to lend a favourable ear to the 
calumnies which are so industriously circulated to the preju- 
dice of every one who is placed in a situation in any way 
conspicious and of which I have had my full share. Be the 
event of my opinions and predictions what they may I am 
satisfied that I shall suffer no otherwise in the estimation of 
the President than to be considered as a man of feeble judge- 
ment and credulous disposition. That indeed would be suf- 
ficiently mortifying and humiliating but I willingly run the 
risque of incurring it by again reporting that unless some 
decisive and energetic measure is adopted to break up the 
combination formed by the Prophet we shall soon have every 
Indian tribe in this quarter united against us and you may 
depend on it that it will be attended with much trouble and 
expence and loss of blood to subdue them. In my former 
communications I have treated so largely upon the situation 
of the Indians and the causes which would bring them to 
unite and to make war upon us that I deem it unnecessary 
to repeat them. As little would I consider myself authorized 
to trespass upon you a reiteration of those opinions which I 
have before given upon the plan that was proper to be adopted 
to defeat the Prophet's schemes. I shall only observe, that 
I had attached some degree of importance to the proposition 
which I had the honor to make last fall of sending a speech 
from your office to the Prophet in the President's name. He 
has been repeatedly told that the acquirement of more land 
was no object with the U. States. That they had more than 
they could possibly settle, that the frequent purchases which 
have been made for some years past had no other object than 
to distress the Indians, that the schemes originated with me 
and that the U. States would give up a considerable part of 
them rather than go to war with the Indians and the latter 
had nothing to do but to contend for them in this way and 
everything they required would be granted. 

Although I have no doubt that the mischief which has been 
done in the Illinois is to be attributed to the Prophet, I think 
it nevertheless extremely probable that his friends there have 
gone further than he intended and that he did not mean that 



 

more than one or two persons should be killed, for upon ma- 
ture reflection and comparing a number of circumstances 
which I have learned relatively to his situation I do not think 
that he intended that the war should break out at this time. 
I may however be mistaken. Those circumstances which I 
mention as forming the ground of my opinion may have been 
artfully brought into view for the purpose of deception. 

Mr. John Johnson the Factor of Fort Wayne has applied to 
me for the agency of the Shawanese Tribe with a small salary 
and in case of success will resign his appointment as Factor. 
His object is to live on his farm near the Town of the Shaw- 
anese. He says he will require no interpreter nor will the 
agency be attended with any other expense than the five hun- 
dred dollars which may be allowed him as a salary. If the 
arrangement which I had the honor to recommend in April 
last for the appointment of a sub-agent for each Tribe be 
adopted I can see no objection to gratify Mr. Johnson, but 
the loss of his sei-\'ices from Fort Wayne which I estimate 
very highly.

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your excel-

The fourth regiment, with a company of riflemen, mak- 
ing in the whole 500 men, is ordered to descend the Ohio from 
Pittsburgh, with all possible expedition. Captain [William] 
Piatt' of the second regiment, who will be in advance, will 
advise you of his approach. A letter addressed to him or

ately respected. Colonel Boyd is ordered to follow the advice 
and directions of your Excellency, respecting his movements 
and the positions he is to take. 

Letters from Governor [Ninian] Edwards, announce sev- 
eral murders, and a state of general alarm on the frontier of 
the Illinois territory: Your Excellency, it is presumed, will 
consult with him, and make such arrangements of the mili- 
tary force, as may be best calculated to afford protection. 

The authority of the executive to call out the militia in a 
case like this, notwithstanding an expression in my last, is 
considered entirely competent : and in case circumstances shall 
occur which may render it necessary or expedient to attack 
the prophet and his followers, the force should be such as to 
ensure the most complete success. This force will consist of 
the militia and regular troops. Those under colonel Boyde 
are well officered, and well disciplined in the common tactics 
of infantry; but have no knowledge or experience in Indian 
warfare : Your excellency will therefore, in such an event, as- 
sign to them such*duties as they are calculated to perform. 

If the prophet should commence, or seriously threaten, hos- 
titlities he ought to be attacked ; provided the force under your 
command is sufficient to ensure success. Very respectfully, 
Your excellency's obedient servant

Dawson, Harriaon, 191 

Sir, 

Since my letter of the 17th instant, I have been particularly 
instructed by the President, to communicate to your excel- 
lency his earnest desire that peace may, if possible, be pre- 
served with the Indians, and that to this end every proper 
means may be adopted. By this it is not intended that mur- 
der or robberies committed by them should not meet with the 
punishment due to those crimes, that the settlements should 
be unprotected, or that any hostile combination should avail 
itself of success, in consequence of a neglect to provide the 
means of resisting and defeating it ; or that the banditti under 



 

the prophet should not be attacked and vanquished, provided 
such a measure should be rendered absolutely necessary. Cir- 
cumstances conspire at this particular juncture to render it 
peculiarly desirable that hostilities (of any kind or to any de- 
gree not indispensable required) should be avoided. The force 
under colonel [John P.] Boyde has been ordered to descend 
the Ohio. Instead of Louisville, they will make their first 
halt at Newport, Kentucky where they will await your orders. 
Captain [William] Piatt, who will be in advance, will receive 
your first instructions. And although the force is at the dis- 
posal of your excellency, I am instructed to inform you, that 
the President indulges the hope and expectation that your 
exertions and measures with the Indians, will be such as may 
render their march to the Indiana territory unnecessary, and 
that they may remain liable to another disposition. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully. 

Your excellency's most obedient servant.

Sir: 

In the letter which I had the honor to write you on the 10th 
Instant I informed you that Tecumseh had been told by Capt. 
[Walter] Wilson that I would not sufi:er him to come here with 
a large body of Indians and that he promised he would bring 
a few with him only — Nothwithstanding this he is now ac- 
tually within a few miles of me with one hundred and twenty 
or thirty warriors exclusive of the Weas who are coming on 
behind him. The Chief of the latter I know he has seduced 
to his interest. How many of his men may have followed his 
example I know not — but the greater part of them are rascals 
that will engage in any mischief that their fears will permit 
them to undertake. The preparation which I have made to 
repel an attack should one be made is the stationing two com- 
panies of militia Infantry and a Detachment of fifteen 
Dragoons on the borders of the Town which are relieved every 
two days. The whole of the neighbouring militia are put on 
the alert. 



 

The above mentioned force is not sufficient for the defence 
of the Town. It would require at least four Companies but 
the scarcity of providing has prevented me from employing 
moi-e. We shall now however assume the most imposing atti- 
tude. The insolence which is manifested by the Shawnee by 
bringing such a body of men with him after my positive in- 
junction to the contrary shows his real character. If it was 
not for the solemn injunctions of the President to preserve 
peace if possible he should not come here until he had se- 
cured the right to do so by a previous victory. But under 
the obligations imposed by your orders of November last I 
shall bear with him as much as is possible until your final in- 
structions shall be received. The alarm and irritation 
amongst the people has however reached to such a heighth 
that I am in constant apprehension of their firing upon some 
of the parties that are passing through the settlements in 
every direction. And it is impossible for them to distinguish 
the hostile Tribes from those that are friendly. To prevent 
any accident of this kind I keep the Interpreter [Michael] 
Brouillette constantly riding through the country visiting the 
Indian Camps and informing the whites of what he has 
learned respecting them. 

I have the honor to be with great Respect Sir 
your humble Servt

Petition to James Madison, President of the United States 

July 31 1811 
q._ Dawson, Harrison, 189 

In obedience to the wishes of a numerous meeting of our 
fellow citizens, assembled for the purpose of taking into con- 
sideration the state of the country in relation to Indian affairs, 
we have the honor to address you. In approaching the chief 
magistrate of our country, who is so deservedly celebrated for 
the talents which distinguish the statesman, and the virtues 
which adorn the man, we should not do justice to our own feel- 
ings, and the feelings of those whom we represent, if we neg- 
lected to express our confidence in his administration, and our 
sincere respect and esteem for his person. 



 

In fulfilling the duty which has been assigned to us, sir, it is 
scarcely necessary that we should do more than to refer you 
to the resolutions which are enclosed; they contain a true 
statement of facts, and a true picture of the feelings of the 
citizens of this part of the country. It is impossible to doubt 
but that the combination which has been formed on the Wa- 
bash, is a British scheme; and it is equally certain that this 
banditti is now about to be let loose upon us, and that nothing 
but vigorous measures will prevent it. In this part of the 
country we have not as yet lost any of our fellow citizens by 
the Indians ; but depredations upon the property of those who 
live upon the frontiers, and insults to the families that are 
left unprotected, almost daily occur. 

The impunity with which these savages have been so long 
suffered to commit crimes, has raised their insolence to a 
pitch that is no longer supportable. We are not, sir, advo- 
cates for unnecessary rigor towards our Indian neighbors. 
The character which some of us sustain as ministers of the 
gospel of Christ, will shield us from the supposition that we 
wish to plunge our county in an unnecessary war — our object 
is peace — but we are fully persuaded that that blessing can 
now only be secured to us by the exertion of some rigor. 

Let the savages be made sensible that every aggression 
from them will meet with correspondent punishment, and In- 
dian depredations will seldom be heard of. 

Since the adoption of the resolutions under which we act, we 
have listened to the speech delivered by the brother of the 
prophet to Governor Harrison, and if a doubt remained upon 
our minds as to the designs of the confederacy he has formed, 
it has been completely removed. Shall we then quietly wait 
the stroke, when we see the weapon is suspended over us ; we 
hope and trust that this will not be expected, and that the 
general government will take effectual measures to avert the 
danger. What these measures shall be we will not presume 
to dictate ; but we beg leave most respectfully to observe that 
we conceive that the country will forever be exposed to those 
alarms, which are at once so injurious to its settlement, and 
the interest of the United States, as long as the banditti under 
the prophet are suffered to remain where they now are. The 
people have become highly irritated and alarmed, and if the 
government will not direct their energies, we fear that the 
innocent will feel the effects of their resentment, and a gen- 



 

eral war be the consequence. The western country, sir, is 
indebted to your predecessor for an undeviating attention to 
its prosperity, and the gratitude and attachment which they 
feel towards that distinguished patriot, can never be effaced. 
With equal confidence they look up to his successor who, pur- 
suing the same course of politics with regard to European 
powers, is to them sufficient proof of coincidence of sentiment 
in that which relates to the continent. 

That you may be the means under providence of establishing 
the affairs of your countiy, and settling its interests in every 
quarter of the globe upon a secure and lasting foundation, and 
that you may long live to enjoy the blessings of your country- 
men for the happiness you procure for them, is the sincere 
prayer of your 

Fellow citizens,

in which he informed them of the present situation of the 
inhabitants of not only the town, but country, in regard to 
the Shawanese prophet, his brother Tecumseh, and their con- 
federacy of Indians, and advised, that for the safety of the 
citizens, some resohitions should be fallen into; and, there- 
fore, adjutant Daniel Sullivan- introdueced the following reso- 
lutions, which being read and explained in an audible voice, 
both in the English and French languages, were unanimously 
adopted as follows, viz: 

1st. Resolved, That it is the opinion of this meeting, that 
the safety of the persons and property of this frontier, can 
never be effectually secured but by the breaking up of the 
combination formed by the Shawanese prophet on the Wabash. 

2d. Resolved, That we consider it highly impolitic and in- 
jurious, as well to the inhabitants of the United States, as to 
those of the territory, to permit a formidable banditti, which 
is constantly increasing in number, to occupy a situation 
which enables them to strike our settlements without the least 
warning. 

3d. Resolved, That we are fully convinced that the forma- 
tion of this combination headed by the Shawanese prophet, is 
a British scheme, and that the agents of that power are con- 
stantly exciting the Indians to hostility against the United 
States. 

4th. Resolved, That the assemblage of Indians at this 
place, at this time, and under the circumstances which at- 
tended it, was calculated to excite the most serious alarm, and 
but for the energetic measures which have been adopted by 
our executive, it is highly probable that the threatened de- 
struction of this place and the massacre of the inhabitants, 
would have been the consequence. 

5th. Resolved, That a temporising policy is not calculated 
to answer any beneficial purpose with savages, who are only 
to be controled by prompt and decisive measures. 

6th. Resolved, That we approve highly of the prompt and 
decisive measures adopted and pursued by the Governor of the 
territory. We are convinced that the situation in which we 
stand with the prophet and his adherents, rendered them nec-

prophet and his party ; and that he be also requested to insist 
upon the surrender, by the Indian tribes, of those who have

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 6th August 1811 
Har. Pa. Jf^l-U'-' 

Sir: 

In my letter of the 24th ultimo I had the Honor to inform 
you of the approach of the Shawanee Chief Tecumseh with 
a considerable body of Indians. He did not make his ap- 
pearance here untill Saturday the 27th having taken up eight 
days in coming about 75 miles. This delay was owing to a 
disappointment in meeting with the several detachments 
which came by land and who were not at the rendezvous he 
had appointed at the time of his arrival. On the 25th Cap- 
tain [Walter] Wilson, the officer whom I had formerly sent 
to him, met him at Bosseron about 20 miles from this place 
with a message from me expressing my astonishment at his 
bringing so large a force with him nothwithstanding my 
positive injunctions and his promise to the contrary. After 



 

some equivocation he said, that he had but 24 men with him 
and that the rest had come of their own accord and that 
everything would be explained to my satisfaction upon his 
arrival at Vincennes. On Saturday the 27th he arrived with 
all those who came by water and on the next day the party 
which came by land arrived also making in the whole about 
three hundred persons, of whom between twenty and thirty 
were women and children. I endeavoured to get him to an 
immediate interview that I might send him off as soon as 
possible and appointed Monday for that purpose. He would 
not however attend on that day and it was late on Tuesday 
before he made his appearance at the arbor which I had 
erected for the occasion. An hour before his arrival he sent 
to know whether I was to be attended by armed men at the 
council or not, in which case he said his young men would 
be armed also. I informed him that he might take his choice. 
If his men were armed, those which I had on duty would be 
so too, but if his men left their guns at their camp I should 
have no other armed men than 25 or 30 dragoons dismounted. 
He prefered the latter arrangement, and came attended by 
about 170 or 180 men without guns, but all of them having 
knives and tomhawks or war clubs and some with bows and 
arrows. 

In my address to him I mentioned the great alarm which 
the late murders in the Illinois, and his appearance with so 
large a force had occasioned amongst our peoples and told 
him that I was ready to listen to anything that himself or 
any of the Chiefs had to say but that I would enter into no 
negociation on the subject of the late purchase. The affair 
being entirely in the hands of the President who had not 
sent any answer to the claim which he had last year set up 
in behalf of all the Tribes on the Continent. That he might 
if he pleased go and see the President and hear his deter- 
mination from his own mouth. I required an explanation of 
the seizure of the salt. In his reply he began with this sub- 
ject — admitted that it had been taken but said he was not 
at home either this spring or the year before when the salt 
boats arrived — that it was impossible to please me — last year 
I was angry because the salt was refused — and I was this 
year equally so because it was taken — after a few other ob- 
servations of no moment he requested me to adjourn the 
council untill the next day. I was obliged, indeed, to do so 



 

on account of a violent rain. I waited for them the next 
day untill near two o'clock. They at length arrived and the 
Wea chief began a long unconnected speech in which he pro- 
fessed to give a history of all the Treaties which had been 
made by myself on the part of the U. States and the Indian 
Tribes. He concluded with saying that he had heard that 
the Miami chiefs had been forced by the Potawatomies to 
make the late Treaty at Fort Wayne and that it would be 
proper to institute an enquiry to find out the person wlio had 
held the Tomhawk over their heads and punish him. The 
allusion was made to Winemack a Potawatomie Chief whose 
uniform attachment to the U. States had drawn upon him 
the hatred of the Prophet and his party. This statement was 
immediately contradicted by me and the Miami Chiefs who 
were present appealed to for its falsehood. Anxious to bring 
the Council to a close I then told Tecumseh that he had it in 
his power by a single act to manifest the truth of his pro- 
fessions of friendship to the U. States and his desire to pre- 
serve peace, by delivering up the two Potawatomies who 
murdered the four white men on the Missouri last fall and 
who I knew were in his camp. His reply was long and some- 
what artful but his designs were more completely developed 
by it than by anything that I have yet heard from him. He 
said that after much trouble and difficulty he had at length 
brought all the northern Tribes to unite and place them- 
selves under his direction. That the White people were un- 
necessarily alarmed at his measures — that they really meant 
nothing but peace — the U. States had set him the example 
of forming a strict union amongst all the fires that compose 
their confederacy. That the Indians did not complain of it — 
nor should his white brothers complain of him for doing the 
same thing with regard to the Indian Tribes. As soon as the 
council was over he was to set out on a visit to the Southern 
Tribes to get them to unite with those of the North. To my 
demand of the murderers he observed that they were not in 
his Town, as I had believed them — that it was not right to 
punish those people — that they ought to be forgiven as well 
as those who lately murdered our people in the Illinois that 
he had set us an example of forgiveness of injuries which we 
ought to follow. The Ottawas had murdered one of his 
women — and the Osage one of his relations and yet he had 
forborne to revenge them— that he had even taken the Tom- 



 

hawks out of the hands of those who were ready to march 
against the Osages. To my enquiry whether he was deter- 
mined to prevent the settlement of the New Purchase he re- 
phed that he hoped no attempts would be made to settle it 
untill his return next spring. That a great number of In- 
dians were coming to settle at his Town this fall and that 
must occupy that tract as a hunting ground and if they did 
no further injury they might kill the cattle and hogs of the 
white people which would produce disturbance, that he 
wished everything to remain in its present situation until his 
return — our settlements not to progress further — and no re- 
venge sought for any injury that had been or should be re- 
ceived by the white people untill his return — that he would 
then go and see the President and settle everything with him. 
That the affairs of all the Tribes in this quarter were in his 
hands and that nothing could be done without him— that he 
would dispatch messengers in every direction to prevent them 
from doing any more mischief — and that he made full atone- 
ment for the murders which had been committed by the Wam- 
pum which he delivered. 

I made a short reply — telling them that the moon which 
they beheld for it was then night would sooner fall to the 
earth than the President would suffer his people to be mur- 
dered with impunity — and that he would put his warriors in 
petticoats sooner than he would give up a country which he 
had fairly acquired from the rightful owners. I then broke 
up the meeting. I was not however able to get the bulk of 
the Indians off untill Saturday. Tecumseh did not set out 
untill yesterday — he then descended the Wabash attended by 
20 men on his way to the southward. The day before he set 
out he paid me a visit and labored hard to convince me that 
he had no other intention by this journey than to prevail on 
all the Tribes to unite in the bonds of peace. After having 
visited the Creeks and Choctaws he is to visit the Osages and 
return by the Missouri. 

I have not been able to determine what was the object of 
Tecumseh in coming here with so large a force. If it was 
his object to attack the town at some unguarded moment, I 
am persuaded that the Miami chiefs who accompanied him 
knew nothing of it — My spies say that he intended to demand 
a retrocession of the late purchase and if it was not obtained 
to seize some of the Chiefs who were active in making the 



 

Treaty in my presence and put them to death and should I 
interfere I was to have shared the same fate. Had he found 
me unprepared I am certain that he would have found means 
to pick a quarrel. That he had some design in view which 
he thought fit to abandon is most evident from a variety of 
circumstances. At the moment he was promising Captain 
Wilson to bring but a few men with him he was sending in 
every direction to collect his people. Besides those who were 
encamped with him and drew provisions there were consider- 
able numbers hanging about the settlements in small parties 
and at one time upwards of one hundred within two miles 
of the Town northwest of the Wabash. His manner through- 
out the Council was so embarrassed that it was evident to 
all that he had been put out of his Tract and that the speech 
he made was not that which he had prepared for the occa- 
sion. That he meditated a blow at this time was believed by 
almost all of the neutral Indians and the information which 
was given to Genl. [William] Clark upon the subject by some 
of the Mississippi Tribes and to me by many individual In- 
dians and white persons agreed in almost every particular. 

To intimidate and to prevent him from attempting any 
enterprize against us I made as great a display of force as 
possible. The day of his arrival I had a review of the neigh- 
bouring militia at which there were between 700 and 800 
men under arms. The Two infantry companies on duty were 
increased to three and these being relieved on different days 
by some management in marching and changing quarters it 
appeared to the Indians that four or five companies were on 
constant duty. The elegant Troop of Dragoons commanded 
by Captain [Benjamin] Parke (who is also one of our su- 
preme judges) were exhibited to the greatest advantage and 
nightly patrols both of horse and foot announced a vigilance 
which defied surprises. The Indians were in astonishment 
and Terror and I believe most of them went off impressed 
with the belief that Vincennes was not as easily to be taken 
as their chief would have convinced them.

Sir: 

I had the honor to receive by the last mail your letter of 
the 11th ultimo and I sincerely regret with you that there 
are no funds at the disposal of the Executive for paying the 
detachment of Militia who were called into actual service 
last year. The greater part of these men were paid the 
amount of what was due to them by Mr. Charles Smith' a 
merchant of this place soon after their discharge and it has 
been with him some difficulty that I have prevailed upon him 
to refrain from issuing warrants against them. May I ask 
the favour of you Sirs, to write a paragraph in a letter to 
me that I may shew to Mr. Smith assuring him that an ap- 
propriation will be made at the next session of Congress for 
the discharge of this debt. 

It is perhaps fortunate for us here that your letter did not 
sooner come to hand or I should have considered myself pre- 
cluded by it from furnishing the Militia that have been on 
duty here within provinces at the expense of the United 
States — The authority under which the Militia were formerly 
ordered out and which has never been revoked allowed me 
when in my opinion the threatened hostilities with the In- 
dians made such a measure necessary to call two or three 
companies into actual service at the expence of the United 
States. Upon the late occasion I thought it best to relieve 
the companies on duty every two days for this short time 
they could serve without pay and no further expence has 
been incurred than the provisions they have drawn and a 
little forage for the dragoons. 

If the President should think it proper to authorize any 
military enterprise in this quarter, men will not be wanting. 
The Militia of the Territory are subject by lav/ to be called 
out whenever the Governor shall think it necessary. Indeed, 
an army of volunteers from this and the neighbouring Terri- 
tories and States might be had to any amount. I sincerely 
hope that some means may be adopted to protect the settle-

the prosperity of the Territory are equally concerned in it. 
I know a single individual, an emigrant from North Carolina, 
who has $20,000 in cash to lay out in that Tract and num- 
berless other persons are holding up their money for the 
same purpose. 

Captain Z. Taylor^ has been placed in command at the Gar- 
rison near this. To all the qualities which are esteemed for- 
an amiable man he appears to unite those which form a good 
officer. In the short time he has been a commander he has 
rendered the Garrison defensible — before his arrival it re- 
sembled anything but a place of defence.

Sir: 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favors 
of the 11th and 20th ultimo. My letter of yesterday will in- 
form you of the arrival and departure of Tecumseh from this 
place and of the route which he has taken. 

There can be no doubt but his object is to excite the South- 
ern Indians to war against us. His mother was of the Creek 
nation and he builds much upon that circumstance towards 
forwarding his views. I do not think that there is any danger 
of any further hostility until he returns. And his absence 
affords a most favorable opportunity for breaking up his Con- 
federacy. I have some expectation of being able to accomplish 
it without a recourse to actual hostility. Tecumseh assigned 
the next spring as the period of his return. I am informed 
however that he will be back in three months. There is a 
Potawatimie War Chief here, who says he was present when 
the message from the British agent was delivered to the 
Prophet, telling him that the time had arrived for taking up 



 

arms, and invited him to send a party to Maiden to receive 
the necessary supplies. This man is one of the few of those 
who preserve their independence. 

The implicit obedience and respect which the followers of 
Tecumseh pay to him is really astonishing and more than any 
other circumstance bespeaks him one of those uncommon 
geniuses, which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions 
and overturn the established order of things. If it were not 
for the vicinity of the United States, he would perhaps be the 
founder of an Empire that would rival in glory that of Mexico 
or Peru. No difficulties deter him. His activity and industry 
supply the want of letters, for Four years he has been in 
constant motion. You see him today on the Wabash and in 
a short time you hear of him on the shores of Lake Erie or 
Michigan, or on the banks of the Mississippi and wherever 
he goes he makes an impression favorable to his purposes. 

He is now upon the last round to put a finishing stroke to 
his work. I hope, however, before his return that that part 
of the fabrick, which he considered complete will be demol- 
ished and even its foundations rooted up. Altho the greater 
part of his followers are attached to him from principle and 
affection, there are many others who follow him through fear 
and he was scarcely a mile from the Town, before they in- 
dulged in the most virulent invectives against him. The 
Prophet is imprudent and audacious but is deficient in judg- 
ment talents and firmness. 

Under the strong injunctions used in your letter against 
employing the Troops under Col. [John T.] Boyd, but in case 
of absolute necessity I shall forbear to call on here any other 
part of them than the Company of Infantry of the 2d Regi- 
ment commanded by Capt. [William] Piat. 

The outlines of my plan are to call upon all the Tribes, in 
the most peremptory terms to deliver up such of their people 
as may have been concerned in murdering our citizens. To 
require them also to fulfill that article of the Treaty of Green- 
ville which obliges them to give information and to stop any 
parties passing through their districts with hostile intentions, 
and that all such as are marching to join the Prophet are con- 
sidered by us as of that description. To require them also to 
cause such of their people as may have joined the Prophet 
immediately to return to their respective tribes or to put them 
out of their protection. From the Miamies I will require an 



 

absolute disavowal of all connection with the Prophet and 
as they are the owners of the land he occupies I will en- 
deavour to prevail upon them to express to him their dis- 
approbation of his remaining there. To all the Tribes I 
will repeat a declaration which I was instructed to make 
to them some years ago by the Secretary of War. That 
the United States had manifested through a series of 
years the utmost justice and generosity toward their Indian 
neighbours and had not only fulfilled all the engage- 
ments which they entered into with them with good faith, 
but had spent considerable sums in endeavours to civil- 
ize them and promote their happiness but if under those cir- 
cumstances which they all had an opportunity of knowing any 
Tribe should dare to take up the Tomhawk against their 
Fathers, they need not expect that the same lenity would be 
shewn them, as they experienced at the close of the former 
war, but that they would absolutely exterminated or driven 
beyond the Mississippi. I believe Sir that by the employment 
of proper agents to disseminate speeches which shall contain 
the above demands and declaration and by making use of some 
management to secure the exertions of influential chiefs in 
support of them that the combination formed by the Prophet 
will be dissolved. But to ensure success some military force 
must be brought into view, for this purpose if it meets with 
your approbation and there will be time enough to obtain your 
approbation I shall about the middle of September move up 
to the upper line of the New Purchase with the two companies 
of Regulars, fourteen or fifteen companies of militia and two 
troops of dragoons the latter comprising about one hundred 
men. 

Should circumstances render it necessary to break up the 
Prophet's establishment by force and I should discover that 
this force is not sufficient I can add to it two or three other 
companies from this county and as many volunteers as I 
choose to accept from Kentucky, provided thay are suffered 
to be mounted. Indeed, Sir they ought all to be mounted. 
The Militia of the western country are only formidable when 
acting as mounted infantry in this way from the velocity of 
their movements they are formidable indeed undisciplined as 
they are. I have taught a few companies around this place, 
to form a line or lines of battle from a line of mai'ch in the 
manner practiced by General Wayne but excepting these there 



 

is nothing like discipline in the infantry. Let me beg your 
attention to this subject and request that I may be allowed to 
use mounted militia upon any expedition that may be thought 
necessary. If circumstances should render Col. Boyd's Regi- 
ment unnecessary at the point to which they were originally 
destined I had much rather have them than militia. The 
event of General Wayne's action proved that disciplined 
musketry with their flanks secured by Dragoons and mounted 
riflemen are the best troops even against the Indians. In- 
fantry that are disciplined in the common manner can easily 
be formed for woods fighting. It requires only the observ- 
ance of very open order and doubling up instead of wheeling. 

I have this moment received a letter from Governor 
[Ninian] Edwards. No new aggression from the Indians 
had occured in that Territory. Governor Edwards enclosed 
me the copy of a letter from himself to Governor [Benjamin] 
Howard, which contains so many just observations on our 
present difi'erence with the Prophet and his party that I have 
taken the liberty of enclosing you an extract from it. [Not 
found] 

With great respect, I have the Honor to be Sir 
Yr. Obt. Servt

Dear Sir 

Your favor of the 2nd inst. was duly delivered by liiet. 
[Ambrose] Whitlock. In a letter which I wrote to the Secre- 
tary of War mostly after the shocking affair which happened 
at Fort Knox [Murder of Jennings] I mentioned Mr. Whitlock 
as a proper person to be entrusted with the command of that 
Fort. The answer of the Secretary was that he had no other 
objection to Mr. Whitlock being placed in that command but 
from its interference with his duties as Postmaster — He in- 
formed me also that a proper officer would be sent on. Under 
those circumstances & knowing that the command of Lietu. 



 

Whitlock would be of very short continuance I had no hesi- 
tation in recommending to Mr. W. not to deUver your letter to 
Capt. [Zachariah] Taylor. Notwithstanding the very ex- 
traordinary manner by which Capt. T. became possessed of 
the command he certainly deserves no share of the blame — He 
disapproved indeed of the whole proceeding but he certainly 
had no alternative but to obey the order he had received and 
placed in his situation I would have acted precisely as he has 
done altho Lt. [Jacob W.] Albright might very properly have 
refused to give him the command. As you cannot spare a 
Capt. from your cantonment I recommend that Capt. Taylor 
may be continued. He was entirely a stranger to me when he 
came here — but I am much pleased with him he appears to 
be a most amiable man and for his opportunity a good officer. 
Upon the other subject contained in your letter you will I 
hope excuse me from giving an opinion and believe that my 
reasons for declining to give one are such as I cannot dis- 
regard. 

I have herewith enclosed you copies of two letters received 
from the Sec. of War by the last mail by which you will per- 
ceive the protection of this & the Illinois Territory has been 
confided to me & the means which he has authorized me to use 
for the purpose. Under the Strong injunctions used by the 
Secretary not to employ the Troops under Col. [John P.] 
Boyd but in case of absolute necessity I have only called one 
company under Capt. [William] Piat. This will be placed in 
the Garrison of Fort Knox & report to you & be subject to 
your orders in every respect but as to a change of position. 
I do not think it proper for me to interfere nor shall I inter- 
fere in the police or internal management of the military 
that may be subjected to my control (excepting in the way of 
advice) until a part of the militia is ordered into Service. 
Until this does take place I can only give instructions of a 
general nature — Such as the change of position or something 
of the kind leaving the execution entirely to the officer com- 
manding. I have authority from the Secretary of War to 
build a fort or two higher up the Wabash than Fort Knox and 
the present Garrison of the latter was sent here for that ex- 
press purpose. Howsoever it would be highly improper for 
me to use them without a just authority derived from the 
Secretary of War or yourself. The distance to the seat of 
Government is too great to apply for it now. Indeed all that 



 

is necessary for the purpose would more properly come from 
you. I liave therefore to request that you would adress me an 
order to the commanding officer to receive such instructions 
as I may give him — assuring yourself that none other will 
be given than such as are strictly compatable with the rela- 
tive situations we occupy until the Militia are ordered into 
service. The enclosed letters demonstrating the views of the 
Government with respect to the Military arrangements in this 
quarter will be your complete satisfaction for any orders you 
may give on the occasion. 

I meditate an expedition about the 20th of Sept. with the 
2 companies of the regular troops, two of Dragoons & about 
14 companies of Militia — Would you think yourself at liberty 
upon my recommendation and request to join me with all the 
Troops you can have from Belle Fountain & to take command 
of the regulars & one of my Wings. Indeed if your brought 
no troops your personal services would be highly acceptable. 
You could leave the cantonment & the ladies to the care of our 
friend Capt. [Simon] Owens for a few weeks. 

I am with much respect & Esteem Dr. Sr.

Nothing but the most perfect conviction of the necessity, 
could have induced the calling out of the militia. Whether the 
prophet intends to make war, or not, partial war must con- 
tinue to be the consequence; the hostility which he excites 
against the United States is the cement of union among his 
confederates ; and such is the nature of Indians, that they can- 
not be collected, and kept together, under such circumstances, 
without having their minds prepared for war; and, in that 
situation, it is almost impossible to restrain them from prema- 
ture acts of hostility. Were this the only danger, it would 
be sufficient to justify the dispersion of the Prophet's party.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES, August 13th, 1811 

Har. I'd. J,52-J,55 

Sir: 

The distance between us is so great and I have so much 
diffidence in my own judgment, that I have determined to take 
no step of importance in the present state of our Indian Rela- 
tions without the advice and approbation of governors 
[Ninian] Edwards [of Illinois] and [Benjamin] Howard 
[of Missouri]. The most perfectly good understanding exists 
between us and the President may rest assured that our united 
councils and exertions will be directed to preserve peace with 
the Indians. I believe however, that we all agree in opinion 
as to the necessity of breaking up the Prophet's establishment 
upon the Wabash, but at any rate to stop the further accumu- 
lation of force at that point. The latter may perhaps be ef- 
fected by calling upon the contiguous Tribes as we have a 
right to do, to prevent the reinforcements destined for the 
prophet from marching through their country, and the latter 
by calling upon those who are connected with us by treaty to 
withdraw their warriors from him. But our demands and 
remonstrances must be supported by an exhibition of force. 
It is in vain to threaten unless we shew that we are not only 
willing but able and ready to chastise. 

Heedless of futurity it is only by placing the danger before 
his eyes, that a savage is to be control'd. Even the gallant 
Tecumseh is not insensible to an argument of this kind. No 
courtier could be more complaisant, than he was upon his last 
visit. To have heared him one would have supposed that he 
came here for the purpose of complimenting me. This won- 
derful metamorphosis in manner was entirely produced by the 
gleaming and clanging of arms, by the frowns of a consid- 
erable body of hunting shirt men, which accidentally lined a 
road by which he approached to the council House. 

But let me assure you Sir, that I feel most forcibly the re- 
sponsibility imposed upon me, by the president's directions "to 
preserve peace if possible". And that recourse to actual hos- 
tilities shall be had only when every other means shall have 
been tried in vain to effect the disbanding the Prophet's force. 
Unless this is done, no arrangement that we can make, can 
ensure our tranquility for two months. 



 

And it appears to me, that the pecuniary interests of the 
United States are as much concerned in affecting it as are its 
honor and dignity and the peace and prosperity of the citizens 
of the Frontiers. As to the. means of accomplishing it, the ap- 
pearance of a considerable force is essential whether we apply 
immediately to the prophet himself or indirectly through the 
medium of the other Tribes, in the manner proposed above. 
Backed by a measure of this kind our friends amongst the 
Indians would speak with firmness and decision. The timid 
would be overawed and the wavering, and the majority are of 
that description, brought over to our side. 

I shall expect your final directions by the middle of Sep- 
tember and whatever they may be whether agreeing with my 
own opinion or not they will be punctually and cheerfully 
obeyed. 

When the Militia and Regular Troops act together in this 
Territory the articles of war would give me an unquestionable 
right to command. I am not certain what would be the effect, 
should we be obliged to go into an other Territory. The line 
separating this from the Illinois pursues the general course 
of the Wabash for some distance up and is found sometimes on 
one side and then on the other of that River. Besides it may 
be necessary that an expedition should be undertaken against 
some of the Tribes which reside in that Territory. From 
your last letter it appears that the President intended that the 
principal direction of the military should be with me. Would 
it not be proper then that I should receive some specific 
authority for that purpose. I know not well what it should 
be myself, but I should suppose something like that given to 
Governor Lee by the President upon the expeditionary against 
the Pennsylvania insurgents in 1794. 

I have already informed you that the best understanding 
exists between the Governors Edwards and Howard and my- 
self and as neither of them have had any military experience 
I should have no doubt of receiving any authority that they 
could give, but by the ordinance which is our constitution they 
are precluded from giving any commission higher than that 
of Colonel. 

I have the honor to be with great respect Sir 
yr. humble servt.

Since I had the honor to write to you yesterday Lieut. [Abra- 
ham] Hawkins' has arrived being despatched by Capt. [Will- 
iam] Piat from Louisville to receive my instructions. After 
a mature deliberation upon the subject I have thought it best 
to bring on the whole of Col. [John P.] Boyd's command to 
this place for the following reasons. Altho you have not in- 
foiTned me for what point the Troops under Col. Boyd were 
originally intended I am convinced that their route must be 
dowTi the Ohio and Mississippi thus being here then will not 
prevent their pursuing their destination whenever the Gov- 
ernment shall think proper. Lieut. Hawkins informs me that 
the whole Regiment is in Keel boats and this circumstance 
together with the state of the Wabash which is in better 
order for navigation than I have ever seen it at this season 
will make their arrivel here easy and expeditious and unat- 
tended with the expense of land transportation, a considera- 
tion which had some weight with me in forming the deter- 
mination to bring on but one Company. Their arrival here 
(even if they should advance no further) will have the effect 
of convincing the Indians that the Government are seriously 
determined to protect the frontiers and to chastise the re- 
fractory Tribes. Should their services not be required to the 
Southward their being here will supercede the necessity of 
the employment of as many militia for the purposes contem- 
plated in my letters of the 7th, and 13th instant as would 
be necessary without the aid of the Regulars, for these rea- 
sons I am convinced that you will agree with me that the 
Public service will sustain no injury and that it may be bene- 
fitted by bringing on the whole Regiment to this place. It 
will be kept embodied and ready to descend the River when- 
ever orders to that effect may be received. 
I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir

It appears that the fruit of the Shawanee Prophet and his 
band is making its appearance in more genuine colors than 
heretofore. I iiave lately had opportunities of seeing many 
of the Indians of this agency, from different quarters, and 
by what I have been able to leani from them particulai'ly the 
Pattav.^atamies, I am induced to believe the news circulating 
in the papers, respecting the depredations committed in the 
Illinois territory, by the Indians, is mostly correct, and is 
thought by them to have proceeded from Mar Foe, and the 
influence of the Shawanee Prophet. Several of the tribes 
have sent to me for advice. [Extract]

Sir, 

By Mr. [Elihu] Stout,' the printer, I was yesterday in- 
formed that you were organising an army of militia and 
colonel Boyde's regiment to march against the Indians. 

The object of this letter is to say, that I am very desirous 
to be with you in this service, and certainly will attend if I 
am duly informed of the day of rendezvous. It is but rare 
that any thing of the military kind is done — it is still more 
extraordinary that a gentleman of military talents should 
conduct matters of this kind when they are to be done, since 
the land is infested with generals so grossly incompetent. 
Now under all the privacy of a letter, I make free to tell 
you, that I have imagined there were two men in the west 
who had military talents : And you, sir, were the first of the 
two. It is. thus, an opportunity of sei-\'ice much valued by 
me. I go as a volunteer, leaving to you sir, to dispose of me 
as you choose. No commission, I know, can be had; so I shall 
be a soldier. Perhaps some few young men here may join 
me and go on: If I had a full troop, I should like to be in 
the van-guard, very willing to be responsible for the good 
look out. 

1. Elihue Stout was the editor and publisher of the Western Sun at Vincennes. 
He came to Indiana from Ky. and was personally acquainted with Daviess. For a 

biography, see History Knox Count,, (1SS6) 250; Charity Dye, Some Torchbearers, 116 



 

I am not so sure, sir, how your regulars will do. There 
are two ways of doing this business: one depends for its 
success upon the suddenness of the blow; and for this, four, 
five, or six hundred will do very well. The other moves slow, 
with heavy foot and train of baggage; and this ought to be 
fifteen hundred or two thousand, since it gives full time to 
the enemy to fix time, place, etc., and because of its slovmess, 
very subject to be harrassed. 

You see, sir, I am a true militia-man, ready to offer advice, 
unasked, to my officer. 

I have been deliberating whether this army wish to carry 
on war absolutely, or whether the drawing of the sword was 
to be determined by the language and behaviour of the enemy 
after we arrived in their country. 

I would gladly receive a letter from you on this matter. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully yours,

ing out of the outrages lately committed in the Illinois coun-

have a tendency to quiet the fears of our citizens in this quar-

public council at this place. A deputation from each of those 
tribes, with a chief of the Senecas, in all 50 persons reached 
here on the 22'd inst. The conference began on the 23d in 
the morning and ended on the 24th at night. The result is 
as satisfactory as could be wished. I feel no hesitation in 
assuring the public that at present there is not the smallest 
danger to be apprehended from the Showanos, Wyandotts, 
Delawares or Miamies and it is believed many of the Potto- 
wattomies may be considered the true friend of the United 
States. The general govei'nment ever attentive to the safety 
of our citizens are taking measures to procure the satisfaction 
for the outrages already committed and security for the future 
good conduct of the Indians. 

I request the favor of you to publish, for the satisfaction 
of the people at large, this letter, with the two following

Sir, 

Your excellency's letters of the 13th and 14th instant, have 
been received. 

My letters of the 22d, advised, that colonel [John P.] Boyde 
had been ordered to descend the Ohio to Louisville, and await 
your instructions. In case of his being required to march to 
the Indiana territory, he was authorized to purchase pack 
horses, on a presumption that the movement required de- 
spatch. 

The proposal of your Excellency, that the colonel should 
move in his boats by the Wabash, will save the expense of the

Hoof. Shawnee speaker, are given entire. They indicate peace, hostility and distrust of 
both the Prophet and British. 



 

horses and accommodate the troops with baggage. But it 
appears from tlie returns, that the regiment is becoming sick ; 
and, as the fatigue and exposure on the water, may increase 
the propensity to disease, I have left it to the judgment of 
the colonel, to take the route by land or by water, as shall 
appear to him to be most advisable. 

The reduction of this regiment by sickness, may render it 
necessary to employ an additional number of companies from 
the militia, of which, you will judge. 

As the expedition will be commanded by your Excellency, 
it is presumed, no objection or difficulty will arise from cross- 
ing the boundai-y of the territory, if circumstances should 
require it. 

I am respectfully, your Excellency's obedient servant,

Lexington, Aug. 29, 1811 

Liberty Hall, October 2, 1811 

I am now able to inform you that certain information con- 
cerning the campaign up the Wabash is received. 

Gov. Harrison has written a gentleman of this place [Lex- 
ington, Ky.] that he will take the field about the 20th of 
Sept. and has received full powers from the government to 
that effect. 

I would recommend it to my comrades that we rendezvous 
at Louisville on the evening of 13" of Sept and on the morn- 
ing of 14th proceed. This will allow us a day or two to rest 
our horses at Vincennes. I expect to get supplies of pro- 
visions at Vincennes. 

I further recommend to my comrades not to be encumbered 
with too much baggage, which must prevent our usefulness 
as cavalry. Each man ought to have a good blanket under 
his saddle and one girded over it, this latter with hooks and 
eyes so as to answer all purposes of a great coat in bad 
weather and either a tent or bed at night, a pair of tanned 
leather hobbles for his horse, and no clothes which need wash- 
ing except SOX and linen ; a wallet and saddlebags will carry 
all needed supplies. 



5G 

The clothing ought to be a blue coatee and pantaloons with- 
out any scarlet, a hat or leather cap covered with bear skin, 
boots and spurs, and a pair of tanned leather moccasins to 
spare. The arms a good sword and a brace of pistols, with 
good locks, and a belt round the body with cartridge box and 
12 cartridges. The cartridge to consist of such a number of 
buckshot as the caliber of the pistol will permit, provide the 
ammunition but omit making up cartridges till we meet. 

Let each saddle have two secure girths. With regai-d to 
the pay, I have no information at all, but I proceed on the 
confidence that we will fare as other soldiers.

Harrison to Secretary of War 
Jeffersonville (Falls of Ohio) ord September 1811 

Har. Pa. A71-J>72 

Sir: 

I came to this place a week ago expecting to find here the 
Troops under the command of Col. [John P.] Boyd. He did 
not however arrive until this morning. Whatever may have 
been the cause of this delay it is a circumstance much to be 
regretted, as the Ohio has fallen very rapidly, and the Wabash 
no doubt in the same proportion. The arrival of the regular 
Troops at Vincennes will be thus retarded, until within a 
very few days of the time which I had fixed on for march- 
ing up the Wabash. Further reflection has also induced me 
to believe that the destination of these troops spoken of in 
your former letters might be to our frontiers bordering on 
upper Canada. Should this be the case and a winters march 
to that quarter contemplated, the road from Vincennes, would 
not be so eligible as that from Cincinnati, but at any time 
when the rivers are not frozen the former route is much the 
best from the facility for transportation afforded by the 
Wabash and Miami of the Lake. If this surmise of mine 
with regard to the eventual destination of the 4th Regiment 
is correct measures may be taken which would render even a 
winter march from Vincennes by no means impracticable. 
I mention this not with an intention of prying into the views 
by the Government, but merely to show that I have had an 
Eye to every possible inconvenience that could result from the 



 

execution of the discretion vested in me relative to the em- 
ployment of Col. Boyds Regiment. The people of this Ter- 
ritory and Kentucky are extremely pressing in offers of their 
services for an expedition into the Indian country. Any 
number of men might be obtained for this purpose, or for 
a march into Canada. 

Previously to my leaving Vincennes I dispatched messen- 
gers [messages] to the several Indian Tribes containing the 
demands and declarations mentioned in a foi-mer letter — a 
demonstration of force on the Wabash will give efficacy to 
those and will most probably produce an entire dispersion of 
the Prophets party.' But should they fail my own opinion is 
decidedly in favour of marching to the immediate neighbor- 
hood of his To\vn and demanding Hostages for their com- 
pliance with our demands on the subject. I will not how- 
ever venture upon this step unless I receive your directions 
to that effect. It is also a question worthy of deliberation 
whether or not a Fort should be built on the reservation at 
the old Wea Towns, which is within fifteen miles of the 
Prophets Residence. 

I have appointed Capt. [William] Piat Quarter Master of 
the expedition as he appears from a letter of yours to him to 
enjoy your confidence and is I believe very desei'ving of it. 

I have the honor to be with great respect. Sir,

Parke to Harrison 

VINCENNES Sep. 13th 1811 
„ Har. Pa. i73-iT6 

In compliance with your Excellency's request of the 11th 
Inst, the following is respectfully submitted. 

It is a fact that the Prophets party is increasing. 

That defection is evidenced amongst all the tribes from the 
Wabash to the Mississippi and the Lakes. 

That the Indians of the Wabash, Illinois etc. have recently 
visited the British agent at Maiden. 

That they are now returning from thence with a larger sup- 
ply of goods than is known ever to have been distributed to 
them before. 

1. James Miller was a native of N. H., born Apr 25. 1776. He was a lawyer by 
profession and in command of the local militia. When the 4th Regt. under Boyd was 
recruited in New Eng. he accepted the position of major. He was prevented by illness 
from being present at Tippecanoe, being left in charge of Fort Harrison. He dis- 
tinguished himself later at Lundy's Lane. ^^^^.^^_ ,^._^^. ^^ ^^^^_ ^^^ 



 

That rifles or fuses are given to those who are unarmed and 
powder and lead to all. 

And that the language and measures of the Indians indicate 
nothing but War. 

Under these circumstances the publick interest certainly 
does require that a larger auxiliary force of Militia should be 
employed than that contemplated by the Honble the Secretary 
of War in his letter of the 22nd ultimo. 

And from the facts stated, it would not be safe to penetrate 
the country as high up as the upper line of the New Pur- 
chase with the force prescribed by the letter of the Honble. the 
Secretary of War above mentioned — were the attempt to be 
made, it would probably terminate in defeat and destruction. 

But admitting, there would be no danger of a defeat I 
should still insist that a larger force than that contemplated 
by the Honble. the Secretary of War ought to be employed. 

The Prophet appeared as the head of a party about five 
years since. For three years his measures have evidently 
been of a hostile character, negociation has been tried in vain. 
He has not abandoned his profjects and his partisans are now 
found from the Wabash to the Mississippi and up to the Lakes. 
His artifice and intrigues and the bounty of British agents 
have nearly perfected his plan of uniting all the Indians within 
our boundary under him, and nothing but the appearance of 
a force much larger than that contemplated by the Honble the 
Secretary of War will dissolve the confederacy. Four or five 
hundred men might excite alarm on the Wabash ; but to make 
an impression on the distant Tribes a force of several thou- 
sand ought to be exhibited. This would silence the turbulent 
and unprincipled, i-estore the timid and wavering, and give 
countenance and support to the friends of the U. States. 

Means of a temporizing nature or any farther delay would 
evidently jeopardize the peace and safety of the frontiers. 

The smallest reverse of fortune on the part of the Gov- 
ernment would instantly unite all the Indians against it — and 
a five years war would scarcely be sufficient to restore peace 
to the frontiers. 

I have the honor to be respectfully Sir, 
your obt. Servt.

Paul to Manwarring

Mss. in Sfdfe Librari/ 

Dear Manwarring 

I am soi-ry that I have to Charge you with ingratitude I 
have not received a line from you since my return from the 
Legislature last fall. I do not think that I am deserving of 
such treatment I have not even heard who was Elected to 
represent Franklin County nor have I yet received a line from 
my well beloved and most highly Esteemed friend Mr. [John] 
Templeton if you see him please inform him that I have not 
forgot him altho I am much neglected.' 

I flatter myself that we shall have your aid in attempting 
to move the seat of Government from Vincennes. Our object 
is to have it removed to Madison — which is as near the Centre 
of population as any place we can name — from Madison to 
Vincennes by way of the united States road is 120 miles — 
from Madison to Charles Town 30 from there to Corrodon 30 
from Madison to Lawrenceburgh 52 miles from there to 
Brookville 25 from there to the Centre of Wayne County 24 
you cannot doubt of the correctness of this statement the dis- 
tances are proven — which proves Madison in the Centre. You 
my dear Sir (as well as myself) are well apprised of the neces- 
sity of removing the seat from Vincennes you have seen the 
Exertions used in order to influence the minds of the mem- 
bers of our Legislature you well know that it was almost im- 
possible to get a Law passed that did not directly meet the 
approbation of a Certain Class of men at that place [Vin- 
cennes] together with their Connections at other places — The 
interference of Certain men at that place with the members of 
the [mutilated] my opinion is a very detestable imposition 
[mutilated] our Citizens — You Certa [mutilated] The Gov- 
ernor Came forward to the representative's Chamber in order 
to meet the members of both houses to influence them to ac- 
ceed to his measures to accept of and give sanction to Certain 
bills which he had drawn up to reorganize the Judiciary in 
which he Clothed himself with unlimited power I ask for what 
in the name of Common sense Could he have desired such

teresting to the Assembly than the overemphasized slavery question.

awful aspect — I have no objections to [Benjamin] Park being 
a Judge but I do not wish him to Judge for me when sitting

rison being Governor but I cannot consent that my Vote shall 
be Governed by his opinion — I ask what would be the general 
of Opinion If President Madison was to solicit the Votes of 
any of the Citizens of the united States for any Certain Char- 
acter as a member of Congress — or what would be the result 
if the Judges of the high Court of the United States were to 
Come forward and solicit the members of Congress (openly 
in the representative hall) to reorganize the Judiciary and Ex-

such an attemp if it would be a Crime in congress why not

a number of others, Causes me to wish the seat removed from

Taylor to Harrison 

Vincennes Sept. 15th 1811 

Q„. Har. Pa. Jt77-J,78 

Your Excellency has requested my opinion on two proposi- 
tions, the 1st is: Would it be safe to penetrate the country 
as high up as the upper line of the new purchase^ with the 
force prescribed by the Honble. the Secretary of War by his 
letter of the 22nd ultimo? and 2nd admitting that there would 
be no danger of a defeat, would not the object of the Expedi- 
tion be greatly promoted and the public interest essentially 
served by employing the whole auxiliary force provided by the 
Governor say eleven Infantry Companies of Militia and three 
or four Dragoons ? 

In answer to the first proposition I beg leave to state as my 
decided opinion that the force contemplated by the Honble. the 

1. This "new purchase" was bounded on the north by the "ten-o-clock" line, ex- 
tending from near Vallonia in JaoKson county to Montezuma in Parke. 



 

Secretary of War wotild be insufficient to accomplish the ob- 
ject in view with safety. The spirit of hostility manifested 
by the Prophet and his followers (who it is said are daily in- 
creasing) the thefts and murders committed within a few 
months past and the unusual quantities of arms, ammunition 
etc. which not only these but the Indians generally have re- 
ceived from the British agent at Fort Maiden, strongly evi- 
dence a disposition to commence war as soon as a fit opportu- 
nity occurs. If a small force were marched into their vicinity, 
very little doubt can be entertained but it would be attacked 
and most probably be defeated. Should this be the case our 
extended Frontiers would be immediately exposed to the 
ravages and depredations of their warfare. 

But admitting that a defeat would not result from marching 
to the upper line of the new purchase, still it is my opinion 
that the object of the Expedition would be better promoted by 
employing a more considerable force than your Excellency 
has provided. Tho that may probably answer a very satis- 
factory purpose. To dissolve the combination which is openly 
avowed to be forming amongst the Indians and which threat- 
ens destruction to our scattered and defenceless citizens re- 
quires a force that would awe the turbulent and refractory, 
confirm the timid and wavering, and insure protection and 
safety to the friendly and well disposed. It would therefore 
seem to me the best policy to crush in Embryo a scheme which 
if suffered to be matured, will involve the United States in a 
war with the Indians, to terminate which great expence will 
be incurred, and the lives of members of our citizens will be 
saci'ificed. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect, Sir 
your obt. 'servt.

Harrison to Secretary of War

Sir: ^'"- ^'"- ^'*'-^''^ 

I have the Honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 
of the 22nd ultimo. From letters which you will have re- 
ceived from Col. [John P.] Boyd and myself you are apprised 
of my having anticipated your orders and that the whole of 
the Detachment under his command are on their way to this 
place. The Col. came through with me by land from Louis- 
ville and the troops were sent round by water under the com- 
mand of Col. [James] Miller. I calculate upon their being here 
Tomorrow or next day. I must now, Sir, request the honor 
of your attention whilst I explain the motives which have 



cleik of Kn

Hist. Knox County (1SS6) 136 seq. 



 

induced me to exceed your instructions with regard to the 
number of mihtia to be employed as auxiliaries to the regu- 
lar Troops upon the Proposed Expedition up the Wabash. 
In my letter of the 7th ultimo I informed you that I con- 
templated using two companies of Regulars 14 or 15 of 
Militia Infantry and two Troops of Dragoons, making an 
aggregate of nearly 1200 men. The substitute of the whole 
of Cols. Boyd's detachment for an equal number of militia 
is doubtless a very favourable exchange, particularly if the 
object was to bring the Indians to action under any Circum- 
stances. But the number of the Detachment fit for duty on 
this day of their arrival at Louisville was not much above 
four hundred and it is more than probable that other Casual- 
ties will considerably reduce it. Capt. [Thornton] Posey's 
company now in Garrison at Fort Knox with five or six men 
of the Rifle Corps annexed to it will not give more than forty 
effectives making in all of Regular Troops about four hun- 
dred and fifty ; from which is to be deducted a small command 
to be left in Garrison at Fort Knox. The Remainder added 
to the two Troops of Dragoons will form a force of 550 men, 
a number about equal to that which the Prophet has under 
his immediate control. My own opinion is that with this 
force we might march to the upper line of the New Purchase, 
erect a fort and return with safety. It would however pre- 
sent the Indians a great temptation and the defeat of this 
Detachment would give to the Prophet's party an eclat that 
would enable him to effect his pui-pose of uniting all the 
Tribes in a war against us. The appearance of a military 
force in the neighborhood of the Indian towns will produce 
a good or an ill effect in proportion to the operation it will 
have upon their fears. A small body of men will excite their 
contempt, a large one (such as they will think themselves 
unable to resist) will not only deprive them of a wish to meas- 
ure their strength wdth ours, but will cause all those who 
waver to decide in our favour and even many of those who 
are now in close union with the Prophet will think of nothing 
but retracing their steps and submitting to a compliance with 
our just demands. Our Friends will be enabled to speak out 
openly as such and be freed from the necessity of skulking 
about the woods (as at this moment) for fear of their lives. 
You will see below that Mr. [Touissant] Dubois reports that 
almost every Indian from the country above this had been 



 

or were then gone to Maiden on a visit to the British agent. 
We shall probably gain our destined point at the moment of 
their return. If then the British agents are really (as I most 
sincerely believe) endeavouring to instigate the Indians to 
make war upon us we shall be in their neighbourhood at the 
very moment when the impressions which have been made 
against us are most active in the minds of the savages. In 
your letter of the 17th July you enjoin it upon me in the most 
peremptory menner "not to attack the Prophet without having 
a force that would ensure success". The injunction appears 
to me to include a prohibition of placing myself in a situ- 
ation with a military force where I could be attacked with 
success, as the consequences in either case would be nearly 
the same. Upon the whole I think that the preservation of 
peace which is the great object of the President (and cer- 
tainly of myself also) would be jeopardized by the employ- 
ment of any force which the Prophet might think himself 
able to contend with. I do not think him much of a warrior, 
but he is certainly daring, presumptuous and rash. In pro- 
portion to the strength of our Detachment not only the rela- 
tive but the actual numbers of his followers will be decreased 
and if such a force as I could raise in two weeks was to go 
up and erect a Fort upon the reservation at the old Wea 
Towns I would pledge my reputation for judgment and a 
knowledge of the Indian character if four fifths of his fol- 
lowers would not instantly abadon him. And being once un- 
deceived with regard to his ability to defend them they would 
never be brought to unite with him again. I cannot how- 
ever think myself authorized to employ a larger force than 
is sufficient to defer an attack from the Indians or to chasten 
them should they think proper to attempt it. It will consist 
of the regular Troops above mentioned, 2 or more companies 
of militia infantry and three or four Troops of Dragoons — 
at this season of the year the Militia can leave their Homes 
without any material inconvenience. The sole objection then 
to the employment of this force is on account of the addi- 
tional expense and can the pay of a few companies for 35 or 
30 days be an object worthy of consideration to the United 
States when they are employed to take possession of a coun- 
try to which they have a fair and just claim by the sale of 
which they will be so amply remunerated? The sale of the 
small strip adjoining the Greenville Boundary line takes place 



 

next month and unless I am very much mistaken misinformed 
the proceeds of it in two months from the day that the oflice 
is opened vnW bring more money into the public Treasury 
than will be sufficient to reimburse the purchase money for 
both the Tracts and all the incidental expenses which have 
occurred since. I rely upon the Candour of the Government 
for my justification in this affair. The Troops of Cavalry are 
composed principally of Gentlemen to whom the pay is no 
object but as the whole are not of this description I presume 
that no discrimination can be made. I have actually engaged 
but one Troop from Kentucky, but I understand that another 
has been formed by young gentlemen at and in the neighbour- 
hood of Lexington who have done me the honor to think they 
could receive some military information by serving under my 
command. It is not my intention, Sir, to accept of any com- 
pensation for my services on this occasion nor even remunera- 
tion for my expenses. The Beef and Flour which I shall be 
obliged to take from the Contractor will be included in the 
provision abstract but no other article that is consumed in 
my family will be placed to the public account. 

As soon as I received your favour of the 22nd ultimo I 
laid it before Col. Boyd and the Honble Waller Taylor and 
Benjamin Parke two of the supreme judges of the Territory 
and both militia officers and requested their opinions in writ- 
ing upon the Expediency of employing a larger force than 
that contemplated by your letter. I have done myself the 
honor to inclose their several answers. I expect Governor 
[Benjamin] Howard and General [William] Clark daily. 
Governor [Ninian] Edwards is I hear very sick and gone to 
some medicinal spring in Louisiana. I have not heard from 
him since the return of the officer whom he sent up the Illinois 
River to demand the perpetrators of the two late murders 
but I have seen a young man (a connexion of the governor's) 
who was on the command.' He informed me that the chiefs 
professed a willingness to deliver up the culprits but declared 
that they were not within their power having taken refuge 
■with the Prophet. I hope to be able to march on Saturday 

1. July 24, 1811. Governor Edwards ordered Capt. Samuel Levering to eg to 
the tribes near Peoria and demand the murderers of Cole and his neighbors. They 
arrived at Peoria and learned from Gome the Pottawattomie that Five Medals. 
Topenebe. Moquango. Winemac and Marpack — all of Indiana were the guilty parties. 
This was perhaps an evasion.

next. But I have some fear of a deficiency on the part of 
the Contractor. The government need be under no appre- 
hension for us Sir. If the Prophet attacks us we shall beat 
him. I promise you at least that we shall not be surprised 
and that if the men will fight (of which I have not the least 
doubt) they shall do so when perfectly prepared. The Greek 
maxim "Aephales garaot Ameion a thrasus Statelate" which 
was so great a favourite with Augustus (who by the bye was 
I believe inferior as a Warrior either to the little Turtle or 
Tecumseh) shall be ever present to my mind, and in Indian 
warfare (whatever it may be in any other) it is certainly a 
good one. 

When I received your letters of the 17 and 20th July I dis- 
patched an Indian Messenger to bring back the Miami Chief 
who had accompanied Tecumseh to this place and who had 
only left it two days before, the Messenger did not overtake 
them until they had reached their towns. They refused to 
return aledging that the letters which I pretended to have 
received from the President were forgeries and that they 
were told by White Men at Vincennes, that I intended to 
practice this cheat upon them. I immediately prepared 
speeches to be sent to the different Tribes conformably to the 
plan mentioned in my letter of the 7th ultimo and I employed 
Mr. Dubois a French gentleman who is well known to and 
much respected by the Indians to carry the one intended for 
the Miamies. He found the chiefs all preparing to go to 
Maiden. With the assistance however of Messrs. [John] 
Shaw and [William] Wells he got them all together at Fort 
Wayne. The result of the Council discovered that the whole 
Tribe (including the Weas and Eel Rivers for they are all 
Miamis) were about equally divided in favour of the Prophet 
and the United States. I have the Honor to enclose a copy 
of my speech and the original minutes of the Council as taken 
by Dr. [William] Turner^ at Fort Wayne. [Immediately be- 
low] The Lapousier who makes the insolent speech is the 
Wea Chief who spoke in the late council here and whom I 
before mentioned to you as being seduced by the Prophet. 
Mr. Dubois repeatedly demanded of him what land it was 
that he was determined to defend with his blood. Whether 

2. William Turner enlisted in the army from Md. and was a surseon's mate in 
the garrison at Fort Wayne. He served throuRh the War of 



 

it was that which was ceded by the late Treaty or not; but 
he would give no direct answer. Mr. Dubois reports that all 
the Indians of the Wabash have been or now are on a visit 
to the british agent at Maiden. He has been in the Indian 
Trade thirty years and has never known as he thinks more 
than one fourth as many goods given to the Indian as they 
are now distributing. He examined the share of one man 
(not a chief) and found that he had received an elegant rifle, 
25 pounds of powder 50 of lead 3 blankets 3 strouds of cloth, 
ten shirts and several other articles. He says that every In- 
dian is furnished with a gun (either Rifle or fusil) and an 
abundance of ammunition. A trader of this country was 
lately in the King's stores at Maiden he saw 150 keggs of 
Powder (supposed to contain about 60 pounds each) and he 
was told that the quantity of goods for the Indian Depart- 
ment which had been sent over this year exceeded that of 
common years by £20,000 sterling. It is impossible to ascribe 
this profusion to any other motive than that of instigating 
the Indians to take up the Tomhawk. It cannot be to secure 
their trade, for all the Peltries collected on the waters of the 
Wabash in one year if sold in the London market would not 
pay the freight of the goods which have been given to the 
Indians. Altho I am decidedly of opinion that the tendency 
of these British measures in hostility to us. Candour obliges 
me to inform you that from two Indians of diff'erent Tribes 
I have received information that the British Agent abso- 
lutely dissuaded them from going to war against the United 
States. One of them (a Delaware) says that he was present 
at the audience given by the agent (Elliot) to 300 Sacs from 
the Mississippi. The latter informed him that they had taken 
up the Tomhawk against the United States at the request of 
the Prophet and that they come there to get arms and am- 
munition that Elliot told them that he would supply their 
wants but strongly advised them to decline the meditated war.

precisely the same with the Judges Taylor and Parke. 
The Honble WILLIAM EUSTIS Esq. Secretary of War 



 

William Henry Harrison, Governor of the Indiana Terri- 
tory, to the Miami, Eel River and Wea Tribe of Indians 

My children. You had left this place but two days, when 
I had received Letters from your great father the President 
of the seventeen fires, and it was my wish that you should 
know what they contained, because their contents was of con- 
sequence to you. I sent after you one of your own people in- 
viting you to return. You not only refused to do so but you 
insulted my messengers. You insulted me and the great chief 
of the western fires whom I represent. You told him that the 
letters which I pretended to have received was forgeries. 

My Children. This conduct of yours has grieved me much 
and my anger against you was for a while very great but I 
have now cast it off. And I feel nothing but pitty for you 
and anger against those who have deceived you. I now speak 
to you in the name of your Father the President of the seven- 
teen fires — listen to me. 

My Children. My eyes are open and I am now looking 
toward the Wabash. I see a dark cloud hanging over it. 
Those who have raised it intended it for my destruction ; but 
I will turn it upon their own heads. 

My Children. I hoped that you would not be injured by this 
cloud, you have seen it gathering you had timely notice to 
keep clear of it, the thunder begins to roll take care that it 
does not burst upon your heads. 

My Children. I now speak plainly to you. What is that 
great collection of people at the mouth of the Tipecanoe in- 
tended for? I am not blind my children, I can easily see what 
their object is, those people have boasted that they will find me 
asleep, but they will be deceived. 

My Children do not suppose that I will be foolish enough 
to suffer them to go on with their preparations until they are 
ready to strike my people. No. I have watched their mo- 
tions. I know what they wish to do, and you know it also. 
Listen then to what I say. I will not suffer any more strange 
Indians to settle on the Wabash ; those that are there and do 
not belong there shall disperse and go to their own Tribes. 

My Children. When you made the Treaty with General 
Wayne you promised that if you knew of any parties of In- 
dians passing through your country with hostile intentions 
toward us that you would give us notice of it and endeavor to 



 

stop them. I now inform you that I consider all those who 
join the Prophet and his party as hostile and call upon you to 
fulfill your engagements. I have also sent to the tribes who 
have any of their warriors with the Prophet to withdraw them 
immediately. Those who do not comply I shall consider to 
have let go the chain of friendship which united us. 

Mjj Children, be wise and listen to my voice. I fear that 
you have got on a road that will lead you to destruction. It is 
not too late to turn back. Have pity upon your women and 
children. It is time that my friends should be known. I 
shall draw a line. Those that keep me by the hand must 
keep on one side of it and those that adhere to the Prophet on 
the other. 

My Children. Take your choice. My warriors are in mo- 
tion but they shall do you no hurt unless you force me to it. 
But I must have satisfaction for the murder of my people and 
the war-pole that has been raised on the Wabash must be taken 
down. 

My Children let me know your determination by Mr. 
[Touissant] Dubois, he will explain to you everything. Do 
not suffer bad advice to mislead you. Throw yourselves again 
into the arms of your father, and he will receive you and nour- 
ish you. 

Do not be afraid to speak your minds. Tell those people 
that have settled on the Wabash without your leave that the 
land is yours and you do not wish them there. Do not be 
afraid to say this. You shall be supported by my warriors. 
My warriors are getting ready and if it is necessary you shall 
see an army of them at your backs more numerous than the 
leaves of the trees. 

Speeches delivered by the different Miami Chiefs in council at 
Fort Wayne in answer to a speech from William H. Har- 
rison Governor Indiana Territory addressed to the 
Miami Tribe of Indians. 

Laprusikur the Wea Chief. 

William H. Harrison Governor of Indiana Territory. 
Listen to what I have to say, you wish to hear what I had to 
say. You tell us that we are now on a wrong road, a road 
that will lead us to destruction. You are deceived we are not 
on a wrong road. When I was walking a long, I heard you 

37—21182 



 

speak respecting the Shawanee. You said we were of his 
party. I hold both you and the Shawanee by the hand, but I 
hold him slack. You have both told me one story; that if 
I would adhere to you, that my people, the women, and chil- 
dren would be happy. The hearts of the Miamies is good. 
The Great Spirit has put them on the choice spot of land. We 
are now anxiously waiting to see which of you tells the truth. 
For the first time Father your eyes are now open. When you 
cast them on your children you see they are poor, they are 
destitute some of them, even for the necessaries of life. We 
want ammunition to support our women and children; and 
the want of those things has compelled us to undertake our 
present journey. 

Father; we have not let you go, we yet hold you by the hand, 
neither do we hold the hand of the Prophet with a desire to 
injure you, therefore I now tell you, that you are not correct, 
when you supposed we joined hands with the Prophet to in- 
jure you. 

Father I listened to you a few days ago, when you pointed 
out to me the depredations of murder that has been committed 
by the Indians on the Mississippi. I told you that I and my 
people had no wish to join in acts of that kind. I told you 
that we both loved your people, that it gives us pleasure when 
we see them standing around us, that we should deprive our- 
selves of this pleasui-e, if we commence a war with each other, 
as a war would be the destruction of both parties. You al- 
ways told me that our great father, the President of the 
United States had placed you here for good purposes, that his 
heart is good towards his red children. How then does it 
happen that our father's heart is changed toward his red chil- 
dren. 

Father, you have called upon us to fulfill the Treaty of 
Greenville ; in that treaty it is mentioned that we should give 
information if we knew of any hostile design of a foreign 
power against each other. I now tell you that no information 
from any quarter has reached our ears to injure any of your 
people or ours, except from yourself. You have told us that 
the thunder begins to roll. 

Father Your speech has overtaken us at this place, we have 
heard it, but it has not scared us, we are not afraid of what 
you say. We are now going on to that country which has 
been frequently visited by Tecumseh and we shall be able to 



 

know in the course of our journey whether he has told us lyes 
or not; that all the Indians were of the same opinion that he 
is; but when we return we shall be able to tell you whether 
what Tecumseh has told us be true or not. 

Now Father you have heard what I have to say you will 
hear it well what come from me. 

Father you have told me twice that you were very angry 
with me. I went to see you v/ith my warriors. We were sit- 
ting close face to face, and toes to toes, you told me that the 
Indians on the Mississippi had struck you, and 1 said noth- 
ing to you. 

You now tell us that you sent a messenger after us, that we 
had insulted the messenger, yourself, and our great father. 
This is twice you have told that you were angry with us; we 
have looked for the cause, but can find none. 

Father, we the Miamies are not a people that is passionate, 
we are not so easily made angry as it is supposed you are. 
Our hearts is heavy as the earth, and our minds are not easily 
irritated. We don't tell people we are angry with them for 
light causes; we are afraid if we did fly in a passion for no 
cause we should make ourselves contemptable in the eyes of 
others ; therefore we hope you will no more say you are angry 
with us, lest you should make yourself contemptable to others. 
We have told you we would not get angry for light causes. 
We have our eyes on our lands on the Wabash with a strong 
determination to defend our rights, let them be invaded from 
what quarter they may; that when our best intei'est is in- 
vaded, we will defend them to a man, and be made mad but 
once. Father now consider your children the Miamies, what 
they have said to you. You have now ofi'ered the war club to 
us, you have laid it at our feet, and told us we might pick it 
up if we chose. We have refused to do so, and we hope this 
circumstance will prove to you that we are people of good 
hearts. 

We hope father that you will not be angry any more with 
us ; we will not be angry with you. This is all I have to say. 

From an observation of Mr. Dubois the following expres- 
sions fell from the lips of Laprusieur. 

If Governor Harrison draws a line and leaves us out, he 
may, but if he takes us in it is very good. But if our lands 
are invaded, we will defend them to the utmost and die with 
the land. 



 

Here follows the names of the chiefs that was in favor of 
Laprusieur's speech.

Names of the persons that took these notes : 

Wm. Turner Surgeon's Mate U. States Army 
Fort Wayne 4th September 1811. 

SiLVERHEELS the Massassinway Chief spoke at great length 
and said; that he informed his people that he conceived it 
greatly to the interest of his nation, that a decisive answer 
should be given to their great fathers speech, that he had 
asked for it, and that he was entitled to have it, that for him- 
self he had always detested the Prophet and his doctrine, and 
that the interest of the nation required of the Miamies that 
they should have no connection with the Prophet ; that in case 
a misunderstanding should take place between the U. States 
and the Prophet it is the interest of the Nation to remain 
neutral, and hold our father by the hand. 

My Chiefs and warriors now present, I hope this will be the 
answer that you will send to our great father. 

Oscenut, Puttawa Chief: 

He did not wish what he was now going to say to be put on 
paper as it was rather advice to his people. He observed as 
the rest of the chiefs was absent he thought it his duty to make 
a few remarks on behalf of his nation saying that it appeared 
to him that his younger brothers on the Wabash had got on a 
wrong road, that the Gov. had told them of it and that it was 
not yet too late for them to turn back. We the Pottawattimie 
Chiefs have told our young men not to listen to the Prophet 
but notwithstanding some of them was foolish enough to hear 
his counsel. 

Charley the Eel River Chief spoke at considerable length 
very favourably ; but did not wish any part put on paper ; only 
that Laprusieur the Wea chief came forward and made a 



 

speech without consulting or knowing the opinion of the In- 
dians. 

The Little Turtle, Miami Chief, to Governor William H. 
Harrison 

Father your speech by Mr. Dubois was communicated to us 
yesterday. 

Father your children the Miamies of the Wabash are all glad 
to hear what you say, this is the sentiments of the Indians. 

Father you have asked us whether we are disposed to take 
part with the Prophet or hold you fast by the hand, this ques- 
tion causes us to believe that some misunderstanding has took 
place between you and some of our people that has visited you 
lately. It appears also that you have made your intentions 
known to the Pottawattimies respecting the Prophet you have 
told the Pots, and other Indians living on the Wabash to leave 
him you have told the Miamies the same thing, these are 
things that have surprised us. The transactions that took 
place between the white people and Indians at Greenville is yet 
fresh in our minds; at that place we told each other that we 
would in future be friends, doing all the good to each other 
and raise our children in peace and quietness. These are yet 
the sentiments of your children the Miamies. 

Father you have told us you would draw a line, that your 
children should stand on one side and the Prophet on the other 
We the Miamies wish to be considered the same people that 
we were at the Treaty of Greenville, holding fast to that treaty 
that united us the Miamies and Potawattimies. 

Father listen to what I have to say, it is our request that 
you pay particular attention to it. We pray you not to bloody 
our ground if you can avoid it in the fii'st instance let the 
Prophet be requested in mild terms to comply with your wishes 
and if possible avoid spilling of blood. The land on the Wa- 
bash is oui's we have not put the Prophet there, but on the 
contrary we have endeavoured to stop his going there — he 
must be considered as setting there without our leave. 

Father I must again repeat you say you will draw a line 
between your children and the Prophet we are not pleased at 
this because we think you have no right to doubt our friend- 
ship towards you. I have not said much to you but I think I 
have said enough for the present occasion my words are few 
but my meaning is great and I shall close by requesting that 



 

you will pay particular attention to what I have said. This 
is all I have to say. I have said it in presence of your Messen- 
ger and people of this place as also my own people. 

OSCEMIT 

I have said that I am here alone. I have come to attend to 
che interest of my women and children. I have thought it my 
duty to do so as the other chiefs of my nation was absent. 
When I heard the words of my Father. We the Potawatti- 
mies inhabiting the Lakes from Chicago round to the east 
are of the opinion as those of the Miamies. Just delivered by 
the Little Turtle. Notwithstanding some of our foolish young 
men have killed some of the whites. We the chiefs of our 
nation have told our young men not to listen to any bad birds 
that are flying in the air, notwithstanding some of them have 
been led astray in not listening to our words, and have im- 
prudently involved themselves in difficulties. Therefore we 
are determined that their faults shall not be charged to our 
nation. We the Potttaw. and Miamies have been friends and 
brothers since children. We shall continue to be so their 
sentiments are ours and ours theirs. 

Father what we said to each at the treaty of Greenville 
is fresh on our minds we there told each other that improper 
conduct of individuals should not involve us in difficulties. 
This also must be fresh in your memories for you wrote it 
down and I hope it will long be remembered by both of us. I 
have nothing more to say. 

White Loon 

You have heard what my Uncle the Little Turtle has said 
and my mind is the same. 

Little Turtle, addressing the Miamies 

I told my people when they were going to see the Governor 
not to say anything respecting the land, that the treaty was_ 
made and it was a fair one, they had signed the paper which 
bound the sale of the lands, and that nothing further should 
be said on the subject; I also charged them whatever they 
did to have nothing to do with the Prophet; that the Prophet 
was an enemy of Governor Harrisons and Governor Harrisons 
of his; that if they formed any kind of connection with the 
Prophet it would make the Governor enemies of theirs. 



 

Extract of a letter from Governor Harrison to Mr. Johnson 
Indian Agent at Fort Wayne 

Under these circumstances it is a matter of the first im- 
portance to ascertain how far the disaffection may have ex- 
tended amongst the tribes of your agency, and to assure the 
fidelity of those who still continue faithful or who may be 
fluctuating between their attachment to us and the induce- 
ments which may be held out to them to join the hostile party. 
From what I have heard and my knowledge of the disposi- 
tions of those two tribes I have little doubt of the fidelity of 
the Miamies or Delawares and I should suppose that that 
part of the Potawatimies under the control of Topenebe the 
five medals and the chief who was lately at the seat of Govern- 
ment ai'e also to be depended upon. You will therefore please 
to communicate to them by apprehensions of the Ti'ibes men- 
tioned above and call upon them to fullfill that article of the 
Treaty of Greenville which obliges them to give information 
to the United States of any hostile intention that may be medi- 
tated against their settlements and also to prevent any such 
hostile party from passing through their country; it will be 
necessary forcibly to impress upon them the necessity of doing 
this for their own safety. For as our people will generally 
pursue the attacking party and it will be impossible for them 
to distinguish the several tribes the innocent will frequently 
suffer for the guilty and a few accidents of the kind will bring 
on a General war with all the tribes. Such will be the wish 
of the Tribes who commence the attack and they will fre- 
quently so manage their war parties as to make the mischief 
they do appear to be the act of our friends. The Tribes of the 
Miamies Delawares and Potawatimies ought then immediately 
to take measures in the first place to find out what is the real 
object of the Prophet and his friends and if they find that he 
is really disposed for war and they cannot induce him to 
abandon the project to fall upon some scheme to protect them- 
' selves from its efl'ects and if possible to keep without its vor- 
tex. We do not wish them to take part with us unless they 
should themselves think it necessary. We wish only to place 
them in such a situation that no part of the exemplary ven- 
gahce which we shall inflict upon these tribes who have the 
temerity to attack us shall fall upon their heads. A situation 
admirably calculated for this purpose is offered by the White 



 

River Country — if a community of the friendly tribes is 
formed on that River from its sources down to the settlements 
and if they absolutely preclude those who are hostile from 
making war in that direction they may remain there in safety 
without the least apprehension of being disturbed by our war- 
riors. 

But to prevent if possible the necessity of this measure 
which cannot do otherwise than produce inconvenience to 
them, a solemn deputation from all the friendly Tribes should 
be sent to the Prophet and his party to remonstrate upon the 
folly and wickedness of their designs, which must inevitably 
terminate in their utter destruction. You will be pleased also 
to state in all your communications with the Indians upon 
this subject that the war that may be waged against us by 
any of the Tribes shall be the last that they shall ever make, as 
it is the positive determination of our Government after hav- 
ing so long and so sincerely laboured for their advantage to 
open their eyes to their inferior condition and to provide the 
means of their improvement and civilization that they will 
not again suffer themselves to be imposed upon by the profes- 
sions of those who have so often deceived but that the War 
once begun it will be pursued to the utter exterpation of those 
who shall commence it or until they are delivered to such a dis- 
tance as to preclude all probability of their again annoying 
us. To the Delawares Miamies and Potawatimies it may be 
observed that if they should be weak enough to suffer them- 
selves to be seduced by our enemies the first consequence will 
be the forfeiture of their annuities which were granted upon 
the express condition of their acknowledgement of their de- 
pendence upon the United States and upon no other power 
whatever. /

It is the intention of the Commander-in-Chief to form the 
whole of the Troops into two lines, the first to be composed of 
all the U. S. Infantry, U. S. Riflemen and such of the Militia 
Corps as may be selected fo)- the purpose. For the present 
Capt. [Benjamin] Parke troop of Light Dragoons, the Har- 



 

rison Volunteers of Capt. [Spier] Spencer^ and the small de- 
tachment of Kentucky Dragoons under Col. [Jos. H.] Davies 
are to report to and receive the orders of Col. [John P.]

Funks- troop of Kentucky Dragoons ai-e to be under the com- 
mand of Col. Bartholemew. Report of all the several Corps 
are immediately to be made to the Adjutant Col. [William] 
McFarland^ and Col. Boyd will please to make arrangements 
for withdrawing the Garrison of Fort Knox. 

He will receive particular directions from the Governor 
with respect to the Command which is to be left there. The 
Col. will also cause the baggage of the regular troops to be 
assorted. That which will not be wanted for the expedition 
will be deposited in Fort Knox. Such as will be useful at the 
point of destination but not wanted on the march will be 
prepared for water conveyance. For the balance wagons will 
be furnished. 

It is expected that all the arrangements in the Quarter 
Master's Depaitment will be completed tomorrow morning. 

Return for camp equipage and deficiencies in arms and ac- 
countrements will be immediately made out and as far as 
possible supplied from the public stores. Returns for Twenty 
four rounds of ammunition for the musquetry and a half 
pound of Powder and one of Lead for the Riflemen per man 
will be immediately made. 

Capt. [William] Piatt will see that the issues are made and 
the balance of the ammunition properly packed for trans- 
portation. 

As long as the troops remain in this town the Adjutant of 
the Several Corps will attend at 12 o'clock each day at Col. 
McFarland's Quarters for orders. 

1. Spier Spencer was born in Ky., moved to Vincennes. thence to Corydon in 
1809. becoming sheriff. He mairied a sister of Judge Wm. Polke. They kept a tavern 
at Corydon and were intimate friends of Harrison. His brother was killed at Tippe- 
canoe. A son. 14 yrs. old, was with him at Tippecanoe. After Spencer's death 
Harrison took the son into his own tent and later saw that he was educated at West 
Point. Spencer was perhaps the most popular hero of the battle.

The Commander in Chief request Lt. Col. [James] Miller 
and all the oflicers and soldiers of the 4th U. S. Regiment and 
the Rifle Company attached to it to accept his thanks for the 
exertions they had used in ascending the Wabash. It is cer- 
tain that their arrival here has anticipated the expectation 
of all those who know the difficulties to be encountered in 
ascending the River in the present low state of the water. 
The conduct of the Troops on this occasion has been highly 
meritorious and is honorable to themselves and the school in 
which they have been trained. No Guards will be necessary 
as long as the troops remain in town but such as are neces- 
sary for the Police, of which the commanding officer of Corps 
will judge. 

A Militia General Court Martial will sit tomorrow at Ten 
o'clock to consist of Thirteen members for the trial of such 
prisoners as may be brought before it, Major Rezin Redman* 
President five Captains and seven Sub. will be detailed for the 
above duty. 

The Quarter Master will procure small orderly books to be 
delivered to the companies immediately. 

All the sick of the regular troops are to be sent to Fort 
Knox and to be placed under the command of Doctor [Jacob] 
Kuykendall. Doctor [Josiah D.] Foster surgeon of the 4th 
U. S. Regiment is to be considered senior surgeon of the 
AiTny. He will have the superintendence of all the stores 
and medicine and to him application will be made to the 
surgeons for those articles. 

The Quarter Master will furnish any articles which Doctor 
Foster may think necessary, as well as the means of trans- 
portation.

Burton, Historical Collection, 170, 171 

The army being formed in the order of march prescribed 
by the General order of this day, if an attack should be made 
on the right flank, the whole will face to the right and it will 
then be in two lines parallel to the line of march, the right 
column forming the front line and the left the rear. Should 
an attack be made on the left flank, the reverse of what is 
here directed will take place till the whole will face to the 
left, the left column acting as the front line, the right as the 
rear. If the attack is made on both flanks at the same time 



 

both columns face outward. To resist an attack in the rear 
the same manoeuvre as is directed for an attack in front, 
with this difference only, that the leading grand division of 
each battalion will form by the filing up of each man in suc- 
cession and the second grand division by doubling round its 
front guide and displaying to the left. To resist an attack 
in the front and rear, the five leading battalions will perform 
the manoeuvre directed for the front attack and the five 
others that which has been last described. In all cases where 
there is an attack other than a front or rear or flank guards 
according to the situation they may be placed in relatively 
to the rear of the ai-my and perform the duties which those 
situation respectively require as heretofore directed.

ViNCENNES 25th Septr. 1811 

Har. Pa. ;,S6-U90 

Sir: 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter 
of the 29th of August, mine of the 18 Inst will have informed 
you that I had anticipated your last instructions by the Em- 
ployment of a larger militia force than was contemplated by 
your favour of the 22nd ultimo. The regular Troops under 
Colonel [James] Miller arrived here on the 19th at night. 
Their sick at that time very little increased from the time 
of their departure from Louisville. Within a day or two 
however a considerable number have been added to the sick 
reports. Their complaints are intermittent of the slightest 
kind and Dr. [Josiah] Foster assures me that the greatest 
part of them which are on the sick report will be able to 
march. This was intended to have taken place on this day, 
but an uncommonly heavy rain which is now falling has in- 
duced me to postpone it until tomorrow. As the militia are 
entirely without tents and the saving them even one severe 
wetting is an object of some consequence. We shall how- 
ever take up our line of march tomorrow morning at Reville 
rain or not. The Cavalry were sent off yesterday to Bus- 
seron (20 miles in advance) where Forage can be more easily 
procured. The 20th inst. had been fixed by me to commence 
our movements and the troops were here on that day, but it 
was not until yesterday that a Boat load of Flour arrived 



 

for the Contractor, this added to what he had here on hand 
amounts to little more than 12,000 rations. He has however 
more coming up the Wabash which will follow us. Our whole 
force will amount to about one thousand men including one 
hundred and forty dragoons and 60 mounted riflemen. 

I have the satisfaction to inform you, Sir, that the speech 
which I sent to several of the Tribes by the Potawatimi Chiefs 
and the report of a considerable assemblage of Troops being 
about to be moved at this place has brought foi-ward a deputa- 
tion from the Prophets Town full of professions of peace and 
that I have extorted from them a promise to comply with our 
demands. But I must previously inform you of a circum- 
stance of a very diff'erent character which happened about 
twelve days ago but which has only entirely developed since 
my last letter. As Capt. [William] Piatt was coming from 
Louisville to this place his Horses and that of another travel- 
ler were taken from the stable on the White River 35 miles 
from this and the night after four others from the Busseron 
settlement. The Trail of the Horses from the latter place 
was very visible, and two white men and a free negro who 
speaks some of the Indian languages went immediately in 
pursuit of them. They crossed the Wabash and on the second 
day near night they came to the Indian Camp. There were 
but three Indians in the camp and they soon discovered their 
own horses. Captain Piatt's and a number more. After some 
consideration they agreed to give up the four horses which 
were taken from Busseron. Our People then commenced 
their return and had gotten but a few miles when they per- 
ceived the Indians in pursuit of them, having but one gun 
amongst them they endeavored to escape by flight but the 
two foremost Indians soon came so near as to fire on them 
and the negroe would have been killed if he had not throwTi 
himself from his horse. They had no other alternative than 
to abandon all the horses (even those which they rode) and 
betake themselves to a thick swamp which luckily presented 
itself. They separated and after having suffered much from 
Hunger and fatigue they all arrived home. The Hostility and 
the Spirit of determined aggression upon us manifested by 
the above transaction called for some energetic measure. And 
I had resolved as soon as I had erected a work at the point 
contemplated on the Wabash that would admit of defence to 



 

make a demonstration towards the Prophets Town and even 
to march into it unless satisfaction was made. 

The apparent head of the mission from the Prophet's Town 
above mentioned is the old hereditary chief of the Kickapoo 
tribe who has been deprived of his authority by the Prophet 
and not supposed to act as a chief since he signed the last 
Treaty two years ago, but the efficient character of the party 
is a war chief of talents, entirely devoted to the Prophet. In 
his first speech he expressed his astonishment at seeing such 
warlike preparations that it had excited great alarm, that 
his women and children were all in Tears, that his heart and 
the hearts of all the Prophets party were warm toward the 
United States that their establishment had no other object 
than peace and that he wanted to know what were our in- 
tentions. In my answer I declared the great reluctance with 
which their Father would draw the sword against his red 
children but that the injuries which his own people had sus- 
tained were such that he could no longer put up with them. 
I recapitulated all the instances of hostility which they had 
manifested towards us and informed him that it was the 
President's positive determination to have retribution for the 
past and some security for the future. In the Council of 
yesterday I informed them that the army would march in 
a day or two, that I should go up the Wabash shortly and if 
they were inclined to join our friends who were endeavouring 
to have the persons who had killed our people taken and the 
stolen horses returned they might meet us on the way. He 
answered that the time was too short, that nothing could be 
done this Fall that we must wait until the next spring and 
then they would get all the Indians together and endeavour 
to find out who had injured us. I then informed him per- 
emptorially that the army would march today and that the 
distance they would go up the Wabash would depend entirely 
on the Indians themselves, that if they would not deliver up 
those who had murdered our people and restore the stolen 
property we must take on ourselves the trouble of finding 
them altho it might be the means of doing some injury to 
some innocent persons. A Potawatimi war chief whom I had 
employed to take one of my speeches in to the Indian coun- 
try at that moment arrived and I seized the occasion of telL 
ing the Kickapoo that that man knew of the hostile inten- 
tions of the Prophet's party and was present (the Kickapoo 



 

himself being also present) when the speech from the British 
Agent was delivered to the Prophet telling him that the time 
had arrived for them to take up arms. But notwithstanding 
we had such full evidence of their bad designs against us we 
would again receive them as oui* children upon their com- 
pliance with our just demands. I gave until this morning to 
consider of what I had said "he wanted no time — he could 
answer them — everything that I wished should be complied 
with as far as possible. The stolen horses should be restored 
he did not know where the murderers were but would en- 
deavour to find them — he would go up to his Town, do what 
he could to satisfy me and return to meet me. The Hour of 
the closing the mail is so near that I have only to add that 
I am with greatest consideration 

your obt. servt.

the three companies of rangers on the Indiana frontier. Though he was well known 



 

not to be included in the detail, they are however to be under 
the command of the officers of the day, and when within the 
line of sentinels are to form such a portion of the chain as 
the officer of the day may assign to them. When without the 
chain of sentinels they will furnish guards for their own se- 
curity only when the troops fall into the line of march. Upon 
the beating of the long Roll the Guards will be conducted into 
camp and will join their several companies a Sergeants guai'd 
of the regular troops only excepted which will be detached to 
form a baggage guard, and for the purpose of picking up 
stragglers. The order of march will be in Two lines as the 
army is now placed. Capt Biggers riflemen in front of the 
column, in line across the direction of the line of march at one 
hundred and fifty yards distance. Capt. [Benjamin] Park's 
troop 50 yards in the rear of this Company and drawm up in 
the same order, Capt. Wilsons riflemen in the same order and 
at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards from the rear 
of the column, Capt. [Charles] Beggs troop in the same order

troop on the right flank at the distance of one hundred yards 
from the column and in a line parallel to it. Capt. Berrys 
and Heths companies will be for the present on the left flank 
at one hundred yards distance from the column. The spies 
and guides will be considerably advanced and will receive par- 
ticular directions from the commander in chief. The order 
of encampment will depend on the nature of the Ground which 
is to be occupied, the Dragoons will encamp within the lines of 
Infantry in such order as may be assigned. They will fur- 
nish a picquet to remain in or out of camp the officer of the 
day may direct to consist of one subaltern one sergeant one 
corporal and twenty privates, one orderly drum will be de- 
tailed for the Deputy Adjutant General, and one orderly ser-

from the quarters of the Deputy Adjutant General excepting 
those which relate to the signals of the several Corps, the taps 

in five or six counties and by half the settlers in southern Indiana no details of 
his life are at hand. 

2. This seems to be Richard M. Heth of Corydon. July 26, 1811 he was appointed 
a captain in the Harrison Co. militia. He bought the fann opened up by Squire Boone 
near Corydon. His name is not on the roster of the Tippecanoe army and no ex- 
planation is offered of the difficulty.

HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 595 

Harrison to Secretary op War 

Camp on the Wabash 65 miles from Vincennes 
October 6th 1811 

Har. Pa. 491-3 

Sir: 

I have the Honor to inform you of the arrival of the Troops 
under my command at this place on the 2nd Inst. The regu- 
lar Troops stood the march surprisingly well. There are a 
good many sick but most of them of very slight complaints 
and there is not an individual who can be called ill. I have 
reconnoitred the country nearly to the boundary line and have 
fixed upon this as the most eligible situation for a fort. The 
timber is now preparing and it will be finished with all pos- 
sible dispatch. We have as yet seen no Indians. Those ex- 
cepted who were at Vincennes previously to the commence- 
ment of our march. I expect a deputation from the Prophets 
Town in five or six days. If I do not I shall send one to him 
and make a movement with the Troops in that direction. 
Those scoundrels have been again plundering our citizens. 
They took eight horses from a detached settlement in the Illi- 
nois Territory about thirty miles above Vincennes nine or ten 
days ago in open day light. I sincerely wish that my instruc- 
tions were such as to authorise me to march immediately to 
the Prophets Town. The Troops which I command are a fine 
body of men and the proportion of Regulars, Irregulars, In- 
fantry and Dragoons such as I could wish it. I have no 
reason to doubt the issue of a contest with the savages and I 
am much deceived if the greater part of both oflicers and men 
are not desirous of coming in contact with them. I bear con- 
stantly in mind your injunctions on the subject of the return 
of the 4th Regiment to Pittsburg this winter. I fear how- 
ever that the thing is Impracticable. Both men and oflicers 
(the colonel excepted) are extremely desirous to winter in this 
Territory, and if they have not time to reach Pittsburgh be- 
fore the Freezing of the Ohio it certainly would be advisable, 
rather than to occupy any intermediate point upon the Ohio 
when they could do no manner of service. This Regiment is 
in great want of clothing. It arrived at Newport shortly after 
the departure of the Regiment from there. Col. Boyd con- 
sulted me upon the subject of the orders to be given respecting 
it and I recommended that it should be sent to the mouth of 



 

the Wabash because the wants of the men were represented 
to be so great as to make it a considerable object to get the 
clothing as soon as possible even if their ascent of the Ohio 
were certain. I shall dispatch the 4th Regiment as soon as I 
can make any satisfactory arrangements with the Indians. 
But if any change of circumstances should render it less nec- 
essary at the point to which it was originally destined I am 
persuaded that its being placed in winter quarters here would 
be greatly beneficial to the public service. I beg you however 
to believe, Sir, that I shall endeavour to the utmost of my 
power to execute your instructions without suffering my own 
views and opinions to have any influence in producing a neces- 
sity for deviating from those which you may do me the Honor 
to communicate. 

With perfect respect I have the Honor to be 
Your Humbl. Servt.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

Camp Battle des Illinois, 
13th Octr. 1811 

Har. Pa. 495-501 

Sir: 

Your letter of the 18th ultimo I had the Honor to receive 
yesterday. My views have hitherto been limited to the erec- 
tion of the Fort which we are now building and to a march by 
way of feint in the direction of the Prophet's Town as high 
perhaps as the Vermillion River. But the powers given me 
in your last letter and circumstances which have occuri-ed here 
at the very moment on which it was received call for measures 
of a more energetic kind. I had always supposed that the 
Prophet was a rash and presumptuous man but he has ex- 
ceeded by expectations. He has not contented himself with 
throwing the gauntlet but has absolutely commenced the war. 
His parties were in our neighbourhood for the first time on the 
night of the 10th inst. our Centinals were fired on and one of 
the best men of the 4th U. State Regiment badly tho not 
mortally wounded. The army was immediately turned out 
and formed in excellent order in a very few minutes. Patrols 
were dispatched in every direction but the darkness was such 
that pursuit of the enemy was impracticable. Other alarms 
took place in the course of the night probably without good 
cause but the Troops manifested an alertness in taking their 
positions which was highly gratifying to me. Previously to 
my leaving Vincennes I had sent to the Delaware Towns to 
request some of their Chiefs to meet me upon the march that 
I might employ them in Missions to the several Tribes which 
have a part of their warriors with the Prophet. All the 
Chiefs of this faithful tribe that were able to march set out 
from their Towns on the 6th Inst. They had proceeded but 
a few miles when they were met by a deputation from the 
Prophet's Town requiring from the Tribes a catagorical an- 
swer to the question "Whether they would or would not join 
them in the war against the United States — that they had 
taken up the Tomhawk and that they would lay it down only 
with their lives. They had however positive assurances of 
victory and when they had beaten the Americans, those Tribes 
who refused to join them would have cause to repent it". The 
Delaware Chiefs immediately dispatched the Interpreter Mr. 



 

[John] Connor and feur of their men to inform me of this 
circumstance and "that they had determined to go immedi- 
ately to the Prophet's Town to endeavour to divert him from 
his purpose, that they would be with me in a few days and 
communicate the result of their mission, and that if they were 
unsuccessful in their endeavours to prevent the Prophet from 
striking us they would abandon him to his fate". From this 
statement of Facts, Sir, you will no doubt be of opinion with 
me that the return of the Troops under my command without 
effecting the dispersion or humiliation of the Prophet's Party 
v.-ould be attended with the most fatal consequences. If he is 
thus presumptuous upon our advance our return without chas- 
tising him or greatly alarming his fears and those of his fol- 
lowers would give him an eclat that would increase his fol- 
lowers and we would have to wage through the Winter a de- 
fensive war which would greatly distress our Frontiers. With 
this conviction thoroughly impressed upon my mind it is with 
the greatest moi-tification I have to observe that my advance 
to the Prophets Town depends upon circumstances which are 
entirely without my control. The supply of provisions on 
hand is by no means sufficient and the means of land trans- 
portation for it altogether inadequate. We have hitherto de- 
pended upon water transportation but it is impossible to rely 
upon it in our advance from this. From the winding course 
of the rivers and the nature of the ground near it the as- 
cending Boats cannot be protected by the army. Defending 
them, by detachments is equally impracticable because I could 
not make them sufficiently large without weakening my main 
body so as to expose it to certain defeat. As soon as I re- 
ceived your letter therefore I directed the Contractor to send 
down to Vincennes for five or six waggons and upon the ar- 
rival of these must depend in a great measure the practicabil- 
ity of our advance. The Fort is in such forwardness as to 
enable me to leave it in three days but it is necessary that we 
should wait for the waggons. The necessity of this delay sug- 
gested the idea of obtaining a reinforcement. I have cer- 
tainly the highest opinion of the bravery of the Troops under 
my command and the composition of this little army is en- 
tirely to my mind, but with regard to actual service they are 
altogether raw and inexperienced. The Militia are the best 
I ever saw and Col. Boyd's Regiment is a fine body of men. 
But like all men who are about to engage a strange and un- 



 

tried Enemy many of the privates have imbibed such ideas of 
Indian address and Ferocity that it was found a matter of 
some difficulty to keep the centinels to their posts the night 
after the alarm. Two of the Delawares who are now in camp 
speak good English and before I was aware of it an opinion 
had been pretty generally imbibed from them amongst the 
men and by most of the officers that our force was too small 
to attack the Prophet with success. From the return which 
is herewith enclosed [Oct. 12, above] you will observe that 
our effectives are but little above nine hundred. From these 
must be deducted a small garrison for this fort and perhaps 
twelve or fifteen more sick than the report recognizes. From 
all the information which I have received I cannot estimate 
the Prophet's force at less than 600 men. Whatever pre- 
cautions I may use it will be in his power to attack us when 
and where he pleases and precipitate the whole of his force 
upon our weakest point. With raw Troops I found upon my 
march hither that it was impossible to preserve that order and 
precision in our movements which is so desirable and nec- 
essary. The menouver which I have adopted for forming an 
order of Battle from the order of march altho extremely simple 
the men are not sufficiently expert in performing altho every 
opportunity has been embraced of practising it. A panic or 
confusion from an attack at that particular moment might be 
fatal. From Mr. Connor I learn that all the Delawares were 
impressed with a belief that the Prophet would attack us and 
that he and his followers were confident of success. I know 
not from whence this confidence can be derived, it is certain 
that it was not felt four weeks ago. I cannot learn that he 
has received any accession of strength and the ridiculous and 
superstitious pranks which he is practising inspire his fol- 
lowers with a belief in his supernatural powers can impose 
upon them only. Whatever may be the cause of this confi- 
dence the probability of its existence is sufficient to inspire 
caution. I do believe most sincerely that the Troops I have 
now with me are equal to the task of beating all the force the 
prophet can muster altho admitting him to have 600. The 
relative proportion is less favourable to us than it has ever 
been in any general action with the Indians, but I am not so 
ambitious of military fame as to subject the troops under my 
command to any unnecessary hazard to obtain it. A few com- 
panies more would make success entirely unequivocal. I have 



 

the Honor to inclose to you the result of a Council which I 
have held with my superior officers on the occasion. With 
their opinion I entirely coincide. I have sent for four Com- 
panies. Three only were contemplated by me but to secure 
them it was necessary to send for four. I shall not wait for 
them but move with cautious steps for twenty-five or thirty 
miles higher up so that we shall not have but forty or forty 
five miles to march when the reinforcement comes up. I have 
directed them to come on mounted. In the meantime my own 
and the exertions of my officers shall be used to inspire the 
men with confidence in themselves and contempt for the 
enemy. 

I would have believed that the message which was sent by 
the Prophet was an empty boast if his parties had not been 
sent to fire on our centinels. But however unsuccessful our 
advance may have been in making a favourable impression 
upon the prophet it is certain that it has made such a one on 
the Weas and Miamis. The Chiefs of the former who have 
just returned from Maiden are now collecting their women 
and Children (who had fled on our approach) at their village 
about two miles from us. The Miami Chiefs are also on their 
way to visit me, and the Weas say that the Wyandots have 
opened the Eyes of them all and that they will never again 
listen to the Prophet. 

I am extremely glad that the return of Colonel Boyd's Regi- 
ment to Pittsburg may be dispensed with. It will certainly 
be of considerable sei-vice here and the season will be so far 
advanced before they can commence their voyage as to leave 
scarcely a probability of their being able to get them, and it 
would be exceeding harrassing to the men. This Regiment 
is not more sickly than when I wrote to you last week altho 
the weather has been uncommonly warm and consequently 
unfavourable. Two men have indeed died in camp within this 
week and one within a few hours after my last letter was 
written but he was so well in the morning as to be able to walk 
out and killed himself by eating heartily of fried liver. 

I have the Honor to enclose to you herewith a letter from 
Dr. [Josiah] Foster. He says that his private aflfairs so im- 
periously require his presence that unless he can get a Fur- 
lough he must resign. I think him so valuable an officer that 
he ought if possible to be kept in service. His presence can 
be dispensed with for you may rest assured that the autumnal 



 

frosts will restore his regiment to perfect Health, and re- 
spectable medical men can be procured here if the Regiment 
should remain with us. Lt. Colonel [James] Miller has been 
very much indisposed but is better. He will not however I 
fear be able to march with us a circumstance infinitely to be 
regretted, for the experience which he has had. I have known 
no better officer and he is so much beloved by the officers and 
men of the 4th Regiment that I am persuaded that they would 
follow him to the Devil. Col. Boyd commands all the infantry 
as a Brigadier. There is not an officer of the regular troops 
(Col. Miller excepted) who cannot eat his rations as heartily 
as he ever could. The two that were left at Vincennes (one 
with an accidental hurt) are well and are coming up. 
I have the Honor to be with the greatest respect. Sir, 
Your Humble. Servt.

Regimental Order 

The officers commanding the different companies will be 
very particular in the execution of the General order of this 
day relative to the inspection of the anns, etc., as quick as 
possible it is to be understood that the examination of the 
arms and ammunition is to be thus particularly attended to 
every day, by the officer commanding the different companies

Brigade Orders 
Camp Battle des Illinois, October, 25th, 1811 

Burton, Historical Colled ion, 176 

Brigade Order 

Pursuant to the General order of yesterday the Brigade 
will commence their march on 27th inst. The moment not 
being distant when they will be called to actual duty enforced 
it on the commander of Corps to see their arms and ammuni- 
tion in perfect order and for that purpose a daily inspection 
. will be made and all deficiencies immediately replaced. 

In the event of meeting the enemy the Brigade will be or- 
dered to make a vigorous and successful charge, the enemy 
will retreat in confusion, the horse will pursue and complete 
the victory. 

Officers and soldiers will remember what their country ex- 
pects from them and what a determined body are capable of 
performing against an inferior number of Indians. Soldiers 
must be obedient to their officers prompt and resolute in exe- 
cution of their duty. Lieutenant Colonel [James] Miller's ill 
health deprives him the honor of leading the Regulars; that 
duty devolves on Major [Geo. R. C] Floyd, and by the di- 
rection of the Commander in Chief Capt. [William C] Baen 
will perform the duty of Major. He will be mounted and 
lead the left wing of the regulars.

Sir: 

The want of provisions and waiting to know the result of 
the Delaware mission to the Prophet has detained me here 
until this time. The Fort has also taken much more work 
than I had expected and the great deficiency of axes and the 
bad quality of those which we had had protracted the finish- 
ing it to double the time that it would have taken otherwise. 
It is now however completed and is a very handsome and 
strong work. The Baggage is now loading and the General 
will be beaten as soon as a Boat load of Flour which can at 



 

this moment be but a few miles from us make the appearance. 
The Delaware Chiefs arrived in Camp yesterday and gave an 
account of their efforts to induce the Prophet to lay aside 
his hostile designs in presence of all the officers. They were 
badly received, ill treated and insulted and finally dismissed 
with the most contemptuous remarks upon them and us. The 
party which fired upon our Centinels arrived at the Tovni 
when the Delawares were there, they were Shawanees and 
the Prophet's nearest Friends. Nothing now remains but to 
chastise him and he shall certainly get it. One of the com- 
panies which I have ordered on will join me today and an- 
other tomorrow. I cannot account for the conduct of the 
Prophet upon any rational principle. Many of the Pota- 
watimies have left him ; from the best accounts I can get he 
has not more than 450 men. But these are desperadoes 
wound up to the highest pitch of enthusiasm by his infernal 
arts. The Delawares left him practising his magic rites and 
performing their war dances day and night. 

I am still in hopes that the Kickapoos will abandon him 
on our approach. The Sick amongst the Militia have greatly 
increased since the last report but the regular Troops which 
are on the sick report are generally better. I am happy to 
inform you that the whole of the Troops are in fine spii'its 
and eager to come in contact with the Enemy. I have used 
every exertion in my power to perfect them in the manouvers 
which they are to perform. I have exercised them myself 
almost daily, and their progress has been such that I do not 
hesitate to pronounce them so perfect as Genl. Wayne's army 
was on the day of his victory over the Indians. I promise 
you Sir that all the objects intended by the Expedition shall 
be effected. 

[William] Well's account of the manner in which the mur- 
ders in the Illinois Territory were perpetrated is absolutely 
false. The truth is that they were directed by the Prophet 
for the purpose of forcing the Indians of the Illinois River to 
unite with him. He has determined to commit to the flames 
the first of our men whom he can take in person. 

I have the Honor to enclose herewith a return of the troops 
under my command. 

I am with sincere respect Sir your humble servt. 

WiLLM. Henry Harrison

Harrison to Secretary of War 
Camp near the Vermilion River Nov. 2nd 1811 

„ Har. Pa. 50U-506 

I arrived at this place with the Troops under my command 
last evening. I crossed the Wabash about ten miles below 
this and have been this day employed in the erection of a 
small blockhouse upon the bank of the Wabash for the pro- 
tection of the provisions and boats which I shall be obliged 
to leave here as the best and more direct road to the Prophets 
Town passes so much to the north ward of the River that 
the Boats can be no longer protected in ascending. Indeed 
I was not able to cover them as completely as I could have 
wished in the ascent to this place. And I was in constant 
apprehension of their being attacked when we were not in 
a situation to defend them. I was congratulating myself on 
their arrival when a letter from Col. [James] Miller (whose 
indisposition was such as to oblige me to leave him at the 
new Fort) announced the unfortunate intelligence of an at- 
tack upon a boat loaded with com which was ascending the 
river from the fort to this place. It was fired on four miles 
above the fort and one man killed. The crew immediately 
returned to the fort. This circumstance has caused me much 
apprehension for the settlements below. I have therefore 
sent off a small detacliment of mounted riflemen to patrol 
round the settlements and have directed the senior militia 
officer at Vincennes to put every man upon the alert and to 
call out one or two companies should he think it necessary. 
The country round me has been examined for a considerable 
distance. Some signs of Indian parties passing southwardly 
have been discovered but in the attempt to trace them up the 
best woodsmen I have were baffled. 

I am now from the best information I can get about 40 or 
50 miles from the Prophet Town. The Country is generally 
open and there are as I understand a few places only where 
we can be advantageously attacked by the enemy. This in- 
formation shall not however lull my vigilance. We march 



 

tomorrow moniing & shall reach one of the most difficult 
passes (called Pine creek) on the 4th Inst, the anniversary 
of General St. Clair's defeat. Should we be attacked on that 
day I hope to alter the Color with which it has been marked 
in our callender for the last twenty years. I have been joined 
by two out of the four Companies of Mounted Riflemen which 
I ordered on. There is no probability of the others coming 
up. The spy which I sent to the Prophets TowTi has not re- 
turned & I very much fear that he has fallen a victim to his 
confidence in the friendship of the Indians for him. 

Captain [Paul] Wentworth' has sent in his resignation 
through Col. Boyd. I was consulted on the occasion & gave 
my sanction to the measure because Eleven out of twelve of 
his brother officers expressed an opinion of his being entirely 
unfit for the service. I thought it best however to order him 
to take the immediate command of the new Garrison [Fort 
Harrison] as the extreme low state of Col. Miller's health 
made it necessary that there should be another officer. I 
remained at the Garrison a few hours after the march of the 
army and the Captain took that opportunity to request my 
permission to leave the Fort and return to Vincennes. I 
pointed out the necessity of his staying and referred him to 
Col. Miller who was so weak as to be unable to walk without 
the assistance of a stick. The Colonel's answer was that he 
hoped I would permit him to go as he had rather spare the 
Captain than the meanest soldier in the Garrison. I mention 
this in the hope that the Captain's pay and Emoluments may 
cease on the 29 Ultimo the day he left the Fort. 

It was my intention to have named the Fort after one of 
the Heads of the Departments who performs his duties not 
more advantageously to the public interests than satisfactorily 
to those who have the Honor to receive their Orders from him, 
but recollecting that it was a temporary work and would be 
only wanted for a few years it occurred to me that I should 
do injury where I meant to do honor. At the request of my 
officers therefore I gave them permission to name the Work 
and they were pleased to call it Fort Harrison

The Battle of Tippecanoe^ [Nov 7, 1811] 

Dawson, Harrison, 20h-208 
McAfee, The Late War, 22 seq 

On the evening of the 5th November, the army encamped 
at the distance of nine or ten miles from the prophet's to\vn. 
It was ascertained that the approach of the army had been 
discovered before it reached Pine creek. The traces of re- 
connoitring parties were very often seen, but no Indians were 
discovered until the troops arrived within five or six miles of 
the town on the 6th of November. The interpreters were then 
placed with the advanced guard, to endeavor to open a com- 
munication with them. The Indians would, however, return 
no answer to the invitations that were made to them for that 
purpose, but continued to insult our people by their gestures. 
Within about three miles of the town, the ground became 
broken by ravines and covered with timber. The utmost pre- 
caution became necessary, and every difficult pass was exam- 
ined by the mounted riflemen before the army was permitted 
to enter it. The ground being unfit for the operation of the 
squadron of dragoons, they were thrown in the rear. Through 
the whole march, the precaution had been used of changing 
the disposition of the diff'erent corps, that each might have the 
ground best suited to its" operations. Within about two miles 

1. George Croghan was a member of one of the pioneer families of the west. His 
home was at Louisville. He volunteered for this expedition along with Jo. Daviess, 
John OFallon, and other young Kentuckians. He later became a hero of the army 
and won a congressional medal for the defence of Fort Stephenson. O. Died Jan.- 8. 1849. 

1. This description of the battle is taken from Robert McAfee. History of the 
Late War, and may be considered as the work of General Harrison. He not only 
furnished the substance to the author but in 1824 when Moses Dawson wrote his 
narrative this was quoted with the approval of General Harrison. The same facts are 
found in the National InleUigenccr, Mar. 4, 1817. Following this there will be a 
number of descriptions of the battle, without the usual regard for chronological 



 

of the town the path descended a steep hill, at the bottom of 
which was a small creek running through a narrow wet 
prairie, and beyond this a level plain partially covered with 
oak timber, and without under-brush. Before the crossing of 
the creek, the woods were very thick and intersected by deep 
ravines. No place could be better calculated for the savages 
to attack with a prospect of success, and the Governor appre- 
hended that the moment the troops descended into the hollow, 
they would be attacked. A disposition was therefore made 
of the infantry, to receive the enemy on the left and rear. A 
company of mounted riflemen was advanced a considerable 
distance from the left flank to check the approach of the 
enemy ; and the other two companies were directed to turn the 
enemy's flanks, should he attack from that direction. The 
dragoons were ordered to move rapidly from the rear and oc- 
cupy the plain in advance of the creek, to cover the crossing 
of the army from an attack in front. In this order the troops 
were passed over ; the dragoons were made to advance to give 
room to the infantry, and the latter having crossed the creek, 
were formed to receive the enemy in front in one line, with a 
reserve of three companies — the dragoons flanked by mounted 
riflemen forming the first line. During all this time, Indians 
were frequently seen in front and on the flanks. The inter- 
preters endeavored in vain to bring them to a parley. Though 
sufiiciently near to hear what was said to them, they would 
return no answer, but continued by gestures to menace and 
insult those who addressed them. Being now arrived within 
a mile and a half of the town and the situation being favorable 
for an encampment, the Governor determined to remain there 
and fortify his camp, until he could hear from the friendly 
chiefs, whom he had dispatched from fort Harrison, on the 
day he had left it, for the purpose of making another attempt 
to prevent the recurrence to hostilities. These chiefs were to 
have met him on the way, but no intelligence was yet received 
from them. Whilst he was engaged in tracing out the lines 
of the encampment, major Daveiss and several other field of- 
ficers approached him, and urged the propriety of immediately 
marching upon the town. The Governor answered that his in- 
structions would not justify his attacking the Indians, as long 
as there was a probability of their complying with the de- 
mands of the government, and that he still hoped to hear 



 

something in the course of the evening from the friendly In- 
dians, whom he had dispatched from fort Harrison. 

To this it was observed, that as the Indians seen hovering 
about the army, had been frequently invited to a parley by the 
interpreters, who had proceeded some distance from the lines 
for the purpose ; and as these overtures had universally been 
answered by menace and insult, it was very evident that it 
was their intention to fight; that the troops were in high 
spirits and full of confidence; and that advantage ought to be 
taken of their ardour to lead them immediately to the enemy. 
To this the Governor ansv/ered, that he was fully sensible of 
the eagerness of the troops; and admitting the determined 
hostility of the Indians, and that their insolence was full evi- 
dence of their intention to fight, yet he knew them too well to 
believe, that they would ever do this, but by surprise, or on 
ground which was entirely favorable to their mode of fighting. 
He was therefore determined not to advance with the troops, 
until he knew precisely the situation of the town, and the 
ground adjacent to it, particularly that which intervened be- 
tween it and the place where the army then was — that it was 
their duty to fight when they came in contact with the enemy 
— it was his to take care that they should not engage in a situa- 
tion where their valor would be useless, and where a corps 
upon which he placed great reliance would be unable to act — 
that the experience of the last two hours ought to convince 
every officer, that no reliance ought to be placed upon the 
guides, as to the topography of the coujitry — that relying on 
their information, the troops had been led into a situation so 
unfavorable, that but for the celerity with which they changed 
their position, a few Indians might have destroyed them: he 
was therefore determined not to advance to the town, until he 
had previously reconnoitred, either in person, or by some one, 
on whose judgment he could rely. Major Daveiss immedi- 
ately replied, that from the right of the position of the 
dragoons, which was still in front the openings made by the 
low grounds of the Wabash could be seen; that with his adju- 
tant Davis Floyd, he had advanced to the bank, which 
descends to the low grounds, and had a fair view of the culti- 
vated fields and the houses of the town; and that the open 
woods, in which the troops then were, continued without inter- 
ruption to the town. Upon this information, the Governor 



 

said he would advance, provided he could get any proper per- 
son to go to the town with a flag. Captain T. Dubois of Vin- 
cennes having offered his services, he was dispatched with an 
interpreter to the prophet, desiring to know whether he would 
now comply with the terms, that had been so often proposed 
to him. The army was moved slowly after in order of battle. 
In a few moments a messenger came from captain Dubois in- 
forming the Governor that the Indians were near him in 
considerable numbers, but that they would return no answer 
to the interpreter, although they were sufficiently near to hear 
what was said to them and that upon his advancing, they con- 
stantly endeavored to cut him off from the army. Governor 
Harrison during this last effort to open a negotiation, which 
was suflicient to show his wish for an accommodation, re- 
solved no longer to hesitate in treating the Indians as enemies. 
He therefore recalled captain Dubois, and moved on with a de- 
termination to attack them. He had not proceeded far, how- 
ever, before he was met by three Indians, one of them a prin- 
cipal cousellor to the prophet. They were sent, they said, to 
know why the army was advancing upon them— that the 
prophet wished if possible to avoid hostilities ; that he had sent 
a pacific message by the Miami and Potawatamie chiefs, who 
had come to him on the part of the Governor — and that those 
chiefs had unfortunately gone down on the south side of the 
Wabash. A suspension of hostilities was accordingly agreed 
upon ; and a meeting was to take place the next day between 
Harrison and the chiefs, to agree upon the terms of peace. 
The Governor further informed them, that he would go on to 
the Wabash, and encamp there for the night. Upon march- 
ing a short distance further he came in view of the town, 
which was seen at some distance up the river upon a com- 
manding eminence. Major Daveiss and adjutant Floyd had 
mistaken some scattering houses in the field below, for the 
town itself. The ground below the town being unfavorable 
for an encampment, the army marched on in the direction 
of the town, with a view to obtain a better situation beyond 
it. The troops were in an order of march, calculated by a 
single conversion of companies, to form the order of battle, 
which it had last assumed, the dragoons being in front. This 
corps, however, soon became entangled in ground, covered 
with brush and tops of fallen trees. A halt was ordered, and 
major Daveiss directed to change position with [Spier] Spen- 



 

cer's rifle corps, which occupied the open fields adjacent to the 
river. The Indians seeing this manoeuvre, at the approach 
of the troops towards the town, supposed that they intended 
to attack it, and immediately prepared for defence. Some of 
them sallied out, and called to the advanced corps to halt. 
The Governor upon this rode forward, and requested some of 
the Indians to come to him, assured them, that nothing was 
farther from his thoughts than to attack them — that the 
ground below the town on the river, was not calculated for an 
encampment and that it was his intention to search for a bet- 
ter one above. He asked if there was any other water con- 
venient besides that which the river aff'orded ; and an Indian 
with whom he was well acquainted, answered, that the creek, 
which had been crossed two miles back, ran through the 
prairie to the north of the village. A halt was then ordered, 
and some officers sent back to examine the creek, as well as the 
river above the town. In half an hour, brigade major 
Marston Clarke^ and major Waller Taylor returned, and re- 
ported that they had found on the creek, everything that could 
be desirable in an encampment — an elevated spot, nearly sur- 
rounded by an open prairie, with water convenient, and a suf- 
ficiency of wood for fuel. An idea was propagated by the 
enemies of Governor Harrison after the battle of Tippecanoe, 
that the Indians had forced him to encamp on a place, chosen 
by them as suitable for the attack they intended. The place, 
however, was chosen by majors Taylor and Clarke, after ex- 
amining all the environs of the town ; and when the army of 
general [Samuel] Hopkins' was there in the following year, 
they all united in the opinion, that a better spot to resist In- 
dians, was not to be found in the whole country. 

The ai-my now marched to the place selected, and encamped 
late in the evening, on a dry piece of ground, which rose about 
ten feet above the level of a marshy prairie in front, towards 
the town, and about twice as high above a similar prairie in 
the rear; through which, near the bank, ran a small stream

clothed with willows and brush wood. On the left of the en- 
campment, this bench of land became wider; on the right it 
gradually narrowed, and terminated in an abrupt point, about 
one hundred and fifty yards from the right flank. The two 
columns of infantry occupied the front and rear. The right 
flank being about eighty yards wide, was filled with captain 
Spencer's company of eighty men. The left flank, about one 
hundred and fifty yards in extent, was composed of three com- 
panies of mounted riflemen, under major general [Samuel] 
Wells,' commanding as a major. The front line was com- 
posed of one battalion of United States' infantry, under the 
command of major Floyd, flanked on the right by two com- 
panies of militia infantry, under captain [W. C] Baen, com- 
manding as a major; and four companies of militia infantry, 
under lieutenant colonel [Luke] Decker;'^ the regulars being 
stationed next the riflemen under Wells, and the militia on 
the other end of the line adjoining Spencer's company. The 
cavalry under Daveiss were encamped in the rear of the front 
line and the left flank. The encampment was not more than 
three fourths of a mile from the town. 

The order given to the army, in the event of a night attack, 
was for each corps to maintain its ground at all hazards till 
relieved. The dragoons were directed in such a case, to 
parade dismounted, with their swords on and their pistols in 
their belts, and to wait for orders. The guard for the night 
consisted of two captain's commands of twenty four men and 
four non-commissioned officers ; and two subalterns' guards of 
twenty men and non-commissioned officers — the whole under 
the command of a field officer of the day.

the camp occupied by the army under the command of gov- 
ernor Harrison, on the night between the 6th and 7th of No- 
vember, 1811, is entirely correct. The spot for the encamp- 
ment was selected by col. [Marston] Clarke, (who acted as 
brigade major to general Boyd,) and myself. We were di- 
i-ected by governor Harrison to examine the country up and 
down the creek until we should find a suitable place for an 
encampment. In a short time we discovered the place on 
which the army encamped, and to which it was conducted by 
us. No intimation was given by the Indians of the v^ash that 
we should encamp there, nor could they possibly have known 
where the army would encamp until it took its position. The 
only error in the above extract is, in saying that major Clarke 
and myself were sent back, by which it would appear that the 
army retrogaded to take up its encampment; this is not the 
fact, the army filed off in front of the town at right angles 
to the Wabash to reach its encampment. It has ever been my 
belief that the position we occupied was the best that could 
be found anywhere near us, and I believe that nine-tenths of 
the officers were of that opinion. We did not go on the Wa- 
bash above the town, but I am certain that there was no posi- 
tion below it that was eligible for an encampment.

Harrison to Secretary of War 
Head Quarters Near the Prophets Town Nov. 8th 1811 

Har. Pa. SOS 

Sir 

I have the honor to inform you that the dawn of yesterday 
terminated an action between the Troops under my command 
and the whole of the Prophet's forces. Their precipitate re- 
treat leaving a number of the warriors dead on the field and 
the subsequent abandonment of their Town (which was par- 
tially fortified) attest for us a complete and decisive victory. 
It has however been dearly purchased — a number of brave 
and valuable men have fallen victims to their zeal for their 
country's service. The behavior of both regulars & Militia 
Troops was such as would have done honor to Veterans. I 
arrived at my present position (a mile from the Town) on 
the evening of the sixth Instant. A correspondence was im- 



 

mediately opened with the Prophet and there was every ap- 
pearance of a successful termination of the expedition with- 
out bloodshed. Indeed there was an agreement for the sus- 
pension of hostilities until a further communication should 
take place on the next day. Contrary however to this en- 
gagement he attacked me at half past four oclock in the 
morning so suddenly that Indians were in the Camp before 
many of the men could get out of their tents. A little con- 
fusion for a short time prevailed, but aided by the great ac- 
tivities of the officers I was soon enabled to form the men in 
order. The companies which were hard pressed were sup- 
ported, several successful charges made, and about daylight 
the enemy were finally put to flight after having penetrated 
to, and killed men in the very center of our Camp. Our killed 
and wounded amounted to 179, of these 42 are now dead and 
seven or eight more will certainly die. I believe that the 
Prophet's force is so entirely routed that he will not be able 
to collect a sufficient number to harrass us on our return. 
But should this be the case it may be in his power encumbered 
as we are with the wounded to do us considerable injuiy. We 
are moreover destitute of every article of provisions except- 
ing the corn (which we have taken) and about four days 
issues of flour at the short allowance of % of a pound per 
man. Indeed the army have drawn no more than this for 
three weeks and all our beef cattle broke from us the night 
of the action and were dispersed and driven ofl[ by the In- 
dians. You may rest assured Sir, that I shall make every 
exertion in my power to conduct the Ti-oops in safety to the 
settlements. I have not been able to ascertain the number of 
Indians in the action, it must however have been consider- 
able. The principal chief of those Potawatamies who have 
joined the Prophet is wounded and in our possession. I have 
taken care of him and shall send him back to his tribe. At a 
more leisure moment I shall do myself the honor to transmit 
a more particular account of the action and of our previous 
movements and am with the highest respect Sir 
your Hble. Sevt.

(Nov. 8, 1811) 

Wood, Canadian War of 1812, I, 280 

Sir 

I have the honor to infomi you, that just as I had finished 
writing you yesterday, a Kickapoo Chief who was in the 
action on the Wabache arrived here, and reports that with- 
out having sent any previous message. Governor Harrison 
advanced from his Fort against the Indians with intention 
of surrounding the Village on all sides, that none might 
escape if they proved refractory. He completely surrounded 
it on the Land side, and attempted it by the River, but the 
Indians boldly ordered him to desist, or it would not go well 
with him — He then asked where he could Camp, and was told, 
"wherever he pleased except round their Village . . ." All 
this time the Officers and Cavalry had their swords ready 
drawn and the Infantry were drawn up ready to fire upon 
them. 

He however retreated about a Quarter of a mile over a 
little rising ground and Camped by a small Rivulet; but be- 
fore he retreated the Indians took a Negi'o and threatened 
to put him to death if he did not inform them of the Gov- 
ernors intention. The Negro told them that he intended to 
deceive them, and they let him go. And the Governor after 
he had encamped, sent the same Negro back to them to de- 
sire them to sleep. sound and be at ease, and not approach 
his Sentinals lest they should be shot, and that he would not 
allow any of his people to go near them. 

The Indians however had their Piquets to prevent surprise 
and often, during the night ordered the American Spies to 
retire from their Posts, without doing them an injury — Two 
young Winibiegoes, no doubt out of curiosity (for it appears 
the Indians had no intention to attack but to defend them- 
selves if attacked) went near some of the American Sentinals 
and were shot at, and fell as wounded men, but on the Sen- 
tinals coming up to dispatch them they arose and Toma- 
hawked them. 

This insult roused the indignation of the Indians and they 
determined to be revenged and according commenced the at- 
tack at Cock Crowing — They had the American between two 



 

fires, driven by the Winibiegoies, they were received by the 
Kickapoos, alternately, until about 9 o'clock vi^hen the In- 
dians gave way for want of Arrows and Ammunition. It 
appears, that not above one hundred Indians fired a shot, the 
greater number being engaged in plundering and conveying 
off horses. 

The women and children saved themselves by crossing the 
river during the engagement. 

The Americans burned the Prophet's Village and all the 
Corn of the Shawanoes, but the Kickapoos saved theirs by 
having had it previously buried. Twenty-five Indians only 
are killed ; the Kikapoo does not know the number of Ameri- 
cans killed, but he says their loss must have been consider- 
able, not less than one hundred. 

The Prophet and his people do not appear as a vanquished 
enemy; they re-occupy their former ground. 

From this man's report, the Chiefs of these Tribes have 
determined to come here early in the Spring to make a de- 
mand of ammunition and Arms. 

The Prophets brother, who went to the Southward in Win- 
ter 1810-11 is reported by this man to be on his return and 
has reached the farthest Kickapoo Town, and is there in Coun- 
cil with the different Nations. He passed Vincennes on his 
way home, and met the Army of Governor Harrison retreat- 
ing, but no insult was offered to him or his few friends who 
accompanied him. 

When the Messenger I sent, returns, I no doubt will 
receive further intelligence respecting the views of the In- 
dians and will lose no time in transmitting it to you — or per- 
haps be the bearer of it myself.

Nations killed in the action viz.

From the manner in which the Kickapoo relates his story 
I sincerely believe his account to be correct.

Sir: 

In my letter of the 8th Instant, I did myself the Honor to 
communicate the result of an action between the Troops under 
my command and the confederation of Indians under the 
Shawanee Prophet. I had previously informed you in a letter 
of the 2nd Instant of my proceedings previously to my ar- 
rival at the Vermilion River where I had erected blockhouse 
for the protection of the Boats which I was obliged to leave 
and as a depository for our heavy baggage & such part of our 
provisions as we were unable to transport in Waggons. On 
the morning of the 3rd Instant I commenced my march from 
the Block house. The Wabash above this turning consider- 
ably to the eastward I was obliged in order to avoid the broken 
and woody country which borders upon it to change any 
course to the westward of North to gain the prairies which 
lie to the back of those woods. At the end of one day's march 
I was enabled to take the proper direction (N. E.) which 
brought me on the evening of the 5th to a small creek at about 
eleven miles from the Prophet's Towni. I had on the preced- 
ing day avoided the dangerous pass of Pine creek by inclining 
a few miles to the left where the Troops and Waggons were 
crossed with expedition and safety. Our route on the 6th for 
about 6 miles lay through prairies separated by small points 
of woods. 

My order of march hitherto had been similar to that used 
by General Wayne, that is, the Infantry were in two columns 
of files on either side of the road and the mounted Riflemen & 
Cavalry in front in the rear and on the flanks. Where the 
ground was unfavorable for the action of Cavalry they were 

1. Compare this with Shabonee's account in India-na Magazine of Historti XVII, 
353-364: Isaac Naylor's account in the same magazine. II. 164; and John Tipton's 
Journal in the same 11, 170. 



 

placed in the rear but where it was otherwise they were made 
to exchange positions with one of the mounted Rifle Corps. 
Understanding that the last four miles were open woods and 
the probability being greater that we should be attacked in 
front than on either flank I halted at that distance from the 
Town & formed the army in order of battle. The United 
States Infantry placed in the center, two companies of Militia 
Infantry and one of Mounted Riflemen on each flank formed 
the front line. In the rear of this line was placed the baggage 
drawn up as compactly as possible and immediately behind 
it a reserve of three companies of Militia Infantry. The Cav- 
alry formed a second line at the distance of three hundred 
yards in the rear of the front line and a Company of mounted 
Riflemen the advanced guard at that distance in front. To 
facilitate the march the whole were then broken off in short 
columns of Companies, a situation the most favorable for 
forming in order of battle with facility & precision. Our 
march was slow and cautious & much delayed by the exam- 
inations of every place which seemed calculated for an ambus- 
cade. Indeed the ground was for some time so unfavorable 
that I was obliged to change the position of the several Corps 
three times in the distance of a mile. At half past two o'clock 
we passed a small creek at the distance of one mile and a half 
from the Town and entered an open wood when the army was 
halted and again drawn up in order of battle. During the 
whole of the last days march parties of Indians were con- 
stantly about us and every effort was made by the Inter- 
preters to speak to them but in vain. New attempts of the kind 
were now made but proving equally ineffectual a Capt. 
[Touissant] Dubois of the Spies & Guides off'ering to go with 
a flag to the Town, I dispatched him with an Interpreter to 
request a conference with the Prophet. In a few moments a 
messenger was sent by Capt. Dubois to inform me that in his 
attempt to advance the Indians appeared on both his flanks 
and altho he had spoken to them in the most friendly manner 
they refused to answer but beckoned to him to go forward and 
constantly endeavored to cut him off" from the army. Upon 
this information I recalled the Capt. and determined to en- 
camp for the night & take some other measures for opening a 
conference with the Prophet. Whilst I was engaged in trac- 
ing the lines for the encampment Major [Joseph] Daviess 
who commanded the Dragoons came to inform me that he 



 

had penetrated to the Indian fields, that the gi-ound was en- 
tirely open and favorable, that the Indians in front had mani- 
fested nothing but hostility and had answered every attempt 
to bring them to a parley with contempt and insolence. I was 
immediately advised by all the officers around me to move for- 
ward. A similar wish indeed pervaded all the army, it was 
drawn up in excellent order and every man appeared eager to 
decide the contest immediately. Being informed that a good 
encampment might be had upon the Wabash I yielded to what 
appeared the general wish & directed the troops to advance, 
taking care however to place the interpreters in front with di- 
rections to invite a conference with any Indians they might 
meet with. We had not advanced above four hundred yards 
when I was informed that three Indians had approached the 
advanced Guard & had expressed a wish to speak to me. I 
found upon their arrival that one of them was a man in great 
estimation with the Prophet. He informed me that the Chiefs 
were much surprised at my advancing upon them so rapidly, 
that they were given to understand by the Delawares and 
Miamis whom I had sent to them a few days before that 1 
would not advance to their Town until I had received an 
answer to my demands made through them. That this an- 
swer had been dispatched by the Potawatamie Chief Winemac 
who had accompanied the Miamis & Delawares on their return 
—that they had left the Prophet's Town two days before with 
a design to meet me but had unfortunately taken the road on 
the south side of the Wabash— I answered that I had no in- 
tention of attacking them until I discovered that they would 
not comply with the demands which I had made — that I would 
go on and encamp at the Wabash and in the morning would 
have an interview with the Prophet & his chiefs and explain 
to them the determination of the President — that in the mean 
time no hostilities should be committed. He seemed much 
pleased with this and promised that it should be observed on 
their parts. I then resumed my march. We struck the culti- 
vated grounds about five hundred yards below the Towai but 
as these extended to the bank of the Wabash there was no 
possibility of getting an encampment which was provided with 
both wood and water. My Guides and Interpreters being still 
with the advanced Guard and taking the direction of the Town 
the army followed and had advanced within about 150 yards 
when 50 or 60 Indians salied out and with loud exclamations 



 

called to the Cavalry & to the Militia Infantry which were 
on our right flank to halt. I immediately advanced to the 
Front caused the army to halt and directed an Interpreter to 
request some of the Chiefs to come to me. In a few minutes 
the man who had been with me before made his appearance. 
I informed him that my object for the present was to procure 
a good piece of ground to encamp on where we could get wood 
and water. He informed me that there was a creek to the 
North West which he thought would suit our pui"pose. I im- 
mediately dispatched two officers to examine it and they re- 
ported that the situation was excellent. I then took leave of 
the Chief & a mutual promise was again made for suspension 
of hostilities until we could have an interview on the following 
day. I found the ground destined for the encampment not al- 
together such as I could wish it. It was indeed admirably 
calculated for the encampment of Regular Troops that were 
opposed to Regulars but it afforded great facility to the ap- 
proach of savages. It was a piece of dry Oak Land rising 
about ten feet above the level of a marshy prairie in Front 
(towards the Indian Town) and nearly twice that height above 
a similar prairie in the i-ear, through which and near to this 
bank ran a small stream clothed with willows and other brush 
wood. Towards the left flank this bench of high land widened 
considerably but became gradually narrower in the opposite 
direction and at the distance of one hundred and fifty yards 
from the right flank terminated in an abrupt point. The two 
columns of Infantry occupied the front and rear of this ground 
at the distance of about one hundred & fifty yards from each 
other on the left and something more than half that distance 
on the right flank. These flanks were filled up, the first by 
two Companies of Mounted Riflemen amounting to about one 
hundred and twenty men under the command of Major Gen- 
eral [Samuel] Wells of the Kentucky Militia who served as a 
Major, the other by [Spier] Spencer's Company of mounted 
Riflemen which amounted to eighty men. The front line was 
composed of one Battalion of United States Infantiy under the 
command of Major [Geo. R. C] Floyd, flanked on the right 
by two Companies of Militia and on the left by one Company. 
The rear line was composed of a Battalion of United States 
Troops under the command of Capt. Baen acting as Major and 
four Companies of Militia Infantry under Lieut. Col. [Luke] 
Decker. The Regular Troops of this line joined the mounted 



 

Riflemen under Gen. Wells on the left flank & Col. Decker's 
battalion formed an angle with Spencer's Company on the left. 
Two Troops of Dragoons amounting to in the aggregate 
about sixty men were encamped in the rear of the left Flank 
& Capt. [Benjamin] Parkes Troop, which was larger than the 
other two, in the rear of the front line. Our order of encamp- 
ment varied little from that above described excepting when 
some peculiarity of the ground made it necessary. For a 
night attack the order of encampment was the order of battle 
and each man slept immediately opposite to his post in the 
line. In the formation of my Troops I used a single rank or 
what is called Indian file, because in Indian Warfare where 
there is no shock to resist one rank is nearly as good ^s two 
and in that kind of Warfare the extension of line is a matter 
of first importance. Raw Troops also manoeuvre with much 
more facility in single than in double ranks. It was my con- 
stant custom to assemble all the field officers at my Tent every 
evening by signal to give them the watch word and their 
instructions for the night. Those given for the night of the 
6th were that each Corps which formed a part of the exterior 
line of the encampment should hold its own ground until re- 
lieved. The Dragoons were directed to parade dismounted in 
case of a night attack with their pistols in their belts and to 
act as a Corps de reserve. The Camp was defended by two 
Captain's Guards consisting each of four non-commissioned 
officers & 42 privates and two Subaltern guards of twenty 
non-commissioned officers and privates. The whole under the 
command of a field officer of the day. The Troops were regu- 
larly called up an hour before day and made to continue under 
arms until it was quite light. On the morning of the 7th I 
had risen a quarter after 4 oclock and the signal for calling 
out the men would have been given in two minutes when the 
attack commenced. It began on our left flank — but a single 
gun was fired by the Centinals or by the guard in that direc- 
tion which made not the least resistance but abandoned their 
office & fled into Camp, and the first notice which the Troops 
of that flank had of the danger was from the yells of the 
Savages within a short distance of the lines, but even under 
these circumstances the men were not wanting to themselves 
or to the occasion. Such of them as were awake or were 
easily awakened seized their arms and took their stations, 
others which were more tardy had to contend with the enemy 



 

in the doors of their tents. The storm first fell upon Capt. 
[Robert C] Barton's Company of the 4 U. S. Reg. and Capt. 
[Frederick] Geiger's' Company of mounted Riflemen which 
formed the left angle of the rear line. The fire upon these 
was excessively severe & they sufliered considerably before 
relief could be brought to them. Some few Indians passed 
into the encampment near the angle and one or two penetrated 
to some distance before they were killed. I believe all the 
other Companies were under arms and tolerably formed be- 
fore they were fired on. The morning was dark and cloudy, 
our fires aff'orded a partial light which if it gave us some op- 
portunity of taking our positions was still more advantageous 
to the enemy afi:"ording them the means of taking a surer aim, 
they were therefore extinguished as soon as possible. Under 
all these discouraging circumstances the Troops Nineteen- 
twentieth of whom had never been in action before behaved in 
a manner that can never be too much applauded. They took 
their places without noise and with less confusion than could 
have been expected from Veterans placed in a similar situa- 
tion. As soon as I could mount my horse I rode to the Angle 
that was attacked I found that Barton's Company had suffered 
severely and the left of Geiger's entirely broken. I immedi- 
ately ordered [Joel] Cook's- Company & the late Capt. [Paul] 
Wentworth's under Lieut. [George P.] Peters' to be brought 
up from the centre of the rear line where the ground was 
much more defensable and formed across the angle in support 
of Barton's & Geigers, My attention was there engaged by 
a heavy firing upon the left of the front line where were sta- 
tioned the small Company of U. S. Riflemen (then however 
armed with muskets) and the Companies of Bain, [Josiah]

Harrison just above Fort Harrison. Geiger brought a new British musket home with 
him from the battle. On the night of the battle Indians entered his tent and were run 
out by the captain. He died on his farm near Louisville Aug. 28, 1832.

Snelling* and [Geo. W.] Prescott^ of the 4th Reg. I found 
Major Daviess forming the Dragoons in the rear of those Com- 
panies and iniderstanding that the heaviest part of the enemies 
fire proceeded from some trees about fifteen or twenty paces 
in front of those Companies, I directed the Major to dislodge 
them with a part of the Dragoons. Unfortunately the Major's 
gallantry determined him to execute the order with a smaller 
force than was sufficient which enabled the enemy to avoid 
him in Front and attack his flanks. The Major was mortally 
wounded and his party driven back. The Indians were how- 
ever immediately and gallantly dislodged from their advan- 
tageous position by Capt. Snelling at the head of his Company. 
In the course of a few minutes after the commencement of the 
attack the fire extended along the left flank the whole of the 
Front, then right flank and part of the rear line. Upon 
Spencer's mounted Riflemen and right of [Jacob] Warwicks^ 
Company which was posted on the right of the rear line it was 
successively severe. Capt Spencer and his first and second 
Lieutenant were killed and Capt. Warwick mortally wounded. 
Those companies however still bravely maintained their posts, 
but Spencer's had suffered so severely and having originally 
too much ground to occupy I reinforced them with [David] 
Robb's Company of Riflemen which had been driven or by 
mistake ordered from their position on the left flank towards 
the center of the Camp and filled the vacancy that had been 
occupied by Robb with Prescott's Company of the 4th U. S. 
Regt. My great object was to keep the lines entire to prevent 
the enemy from breaking into the Camp until day light should 
enable me to make a general and eff'ective charge. With this 
view I had reinforced every part of the line that had suffered 
much and as soon as the approach of morning discovered itself 
I withdrew from the front line Snelling's, Posey's (under

Lieutenant [Jacob] Albright)" & Scott's and from the rear 
line [Walter] Wilson's Companies and drew them up upon 
the left flank and at the same time I ordered [Joel] Cook's 
and [William C] Baen's Companies the former from the rear 
and the latter from the front line to reinforce the right flank 
foreseeing that at these points the enemy would make their 
last eflforts. Major Wells who commanded on the left flank 
not knowing my intentions precisely had taken the command 
of these Companies and charged the enemy before I had 
formed the body of Dragoons with which I meant to support 
the Infantry, a small detachment of those were however ready 
and proved amply sufficient for the purpose. The Indians 
were driven by the Infantry at the point of the Bayonet and 
the Dragoons pursued and forced them into a marsh where 
they could not be followed. Capt. Cook and Lieut. [Charles] 
Larabee>* had agreeably to my order marched their Companies 
to the right flank, had formed them under the fire of the enemy 
and being then joined by the Riflemen of that flank had 
charged the Indians, killed a number and put the rest to a 
precipitate flight. A favorable opportunity was here offered 
to pursue the enemy with Dragoons but being engaged at that 
time on the other flank I did not observe it until it was too 
late. 

I have thus, Sir, given you the particulars of an action 
which was certainly maintained with the greatest obstinacy 
and perseverance by both parties. The Indians manifested a 
ferocity uncommon even with them, to their savage fury our 
Troops opposed that cool and deliberate valour which is char- 
acteristic of the Christian Soldier. 

The more pleasing part of my duty (that of naming to you 
the Corps and Individuals who particularly distinguished 
themselves) is yet to be performed. There is however con- 
siderable difficulty in it. Where merit was so common it is 
almost impossible to discriminate. 

The whole of the Infantry formed a small Brigade under 
the immediate orders of Col. Boyd. The Col. throughout the 

7. Lieutenant Jacob Albright of the First Inf. was commanding a company of 
the Seventh Inf. formerly under Captain Thornton Posey. There is mentioned a 
captain John Posey in the militia under Decker but it is hardly probable a captain 
of the regulars would have been placed in command in his place.

action manifested equal zeal and bravery in carrying into 
execution my orders, in keeping the men to their posts & 
exhorting them to fight with valour. His Brigade Major, 
Clark, & his Aid de Camp George Croghan Esq. were also 
very heroicably employed. Col. Joseph Bartholomew' a very 
valuable officer commanded under Col. Boyd the Militia In- 
fantry. He was wounded early in the action and his services 
lost to me. Major G. R. C. Floyd the Senior officer of the 
4th U. S. Regt. commanded immediately the Battalion of that 
Regt. which was in the Front line. His conduct during the 
action was entirely to my satisfaction. Lieut. Col. [Luke] 
Decker who commanded the Battalion of Militia on the right 
of the rear line preserved his command in good order. He 
was however but partially attacked. I have before mentioned 
to you that Major General Wells of the 4th Division of Ken- 
tucky Militia acted under my command as a Major at the 
head of two Companies of Mounted Volunteers. The Gen- 
eral maintained the fame which he had already acquired in 
almost every Campaign and in almost every battle which has 
been fought mth the Indians since the settlement of Ken- 
tucky. Of the several Corps the 4th U. S. Regl. and the two 
small Companies attached to it were certainly the most con- 
spicuous for undaunted valour. The Companies commanded 
by Captain Cook, Snelling and Barton, Lieutenants Larabee 
Peters & Hawkins were placed in situations where they could 
render more service and encounter more danger and those 
officers eminently distinguished themselves. Captains Pres- 
cott, & [Return B.] Browni'" performed their duty entirely to 
my satisfaction as did Posey's Company of the 7th Regt. 
headed by Lieut. Albright. In short. Sir, they supported the 
fame of American Regulars and I have never heard that a 
single individual was found out of the line of his duty. Sev-

of 5 his father moved to Laurel Hill, Pa. Here he married and in 1788 moved to near 
Louisville. For some years he was a surveyor in the Northwest Ter. In 1798 he 
settled near Charlestown, Ind., where he raised a family of 10 children. He led a 
company of 120 men to join Harrison in 1811. He served as a captain of Rangers 
during the war of 1812. In 1820 he was in the legislature. In 1817 he helped organize 
the grand lodge F. & A. M. at Corydon. Helped locate the capital at Indianapolis in 
1820. In 1830 he lost his fai-m on a security debt and moved to McLean Co. III. He died 
Nov. 2. 1840. the next day after Harrison's election and is buried beside his comrade 
in arms Capt. James Bigger.

eral of the Militia Companies were in no wse inferior to tlie 
Regulars. Spencer's, Geiger's and Warwick's maintained 
their posts amidst a monstrous carnage, as indeed did Robbs 
after it was posted on the left flank, its loss of men (17 killed 
and wounded) & keeping its ground is sufficient evidence of 
its firmness. Wilson's, Scott's Companies charged with the 
Regular Troops & proved themselves worthy of doing so. 
Norris's Company also behaved well, Hargrove's and [An- 
drew] Wilkin's'' Company were placed in a situation where 
they had no opportunity of distinguishing themselves or I 
am satisfied they would have done it. This was the case wth 
the Squadron of Dragoons also. After Major Daviess had 
received his wound knowing it to be mortal I promoted Cap- 
tain Parke to the Majority than whom there is no better 
oificer. 

My two aids de Camp Majors [Henry] Hurst and [Waller] 
Taylor with Lieut. [Nathaniel F.] Adams of the 4th Regt. 
the adjutant of the Troops, afforded me the most essential 
aid as well in the action as throughout the Campaign. 

The arrangements of Capt. [William] Piatt in the Quarter 
Masters department were highly judicious and his exertions 
on all occasions particularly in bringing off the wounded, 
deserved my warm thanks. But in giving merited praise to 
the living let me not forget the gallant dead. Col. Abraham 
Owen,'= Commandant of the 18th Kentucky Regt. joined me 
a few days before the action as a private in Capt. Geiger's 
Company, he accepted the appointment of Volunteer aid de 
Camp to me, he fell early in the action. The Representatives 
of his State will inform you that he possessed not a better 
citizen nor a braver man. Major J. H. Daveiss was known as 
an able lawyer and a great Orator. He joined me as a pri- 
vate Volunteer and on the recommendation of the officers of 
that Corps was appointed to command the Troop of Dragoons. 
His conduct in that capacity justified their choice. Never 
was there an officer possessed of more ardour and zeal to

discharge his duties with propriety and never one who would 
have encountered greater danger to purchase Military fame. 
Captain Baen of the 4th U. S. Regt. was killed early in the 
action. He was unquestionably a good officer and valiant 
soldier. Captains Spencer & Warwick and Lieutenants [Rich- 
ard] McMahon" and [Thomas] Berry'^ were all my particu- 
lar friends, I have had the utmost confidence in their valour 
and I was not deceived. Spencer was wounded in the head, 
he exhorted his men to fight valiantly, he was shot through 
both thighs and fell still continuing to encourage them he was 
raised up and received a ball through his body which put an 
immediate end to his existence. Warwick was shot immedi- 
ately through the body, being taken to the Surgery to be 
dressed as soon as it was over being a man of great bodily 
vigor and still able to walk he insisted upon going back to 
head his Company although it was evident that he had but 
a few hours to live. 

All these Gentlemen, Sir, Capt. Baen excepted have left 
wives and five of them large families of children. This is 
the case too, with many of the privates among the Militia who 
fell in the action or who have died since of their wounds. 
Will the bounty of their Country be withheld from their help- 
less orphans, many of whom will be in the most destitute con- 
dition and perhaps want even the necessities of life? With 
respect to the number of Indians that were engaged against us 
I am possessed of no data by which I can form a correct state- 
ment. It must however have been considerable and perhaps 
not much inferior to ours, which deducting the Dragoons who 
were unable to do us much service was very little above seven 
hundred non-commissioned officers and privates. I am con- 
vinced that there were at least six hundred. The Prophet 
had three weeks before four hundred and fifty of his own 
proper followers. I am induced to believe that he was joined 
by a number of the lawless vagabonds who live on the Illinois 
River as large trails were seen coming from that direction. 
Indeed, I shall not be surprised to find that some of those 
who professed the warmest friendship for us were arrayed 
against us, 'tis certain that one of this description came out 
from the Town and spoke to me the night before the action. 

13. Richard McMahan was appointed 1st Lieut, in the Harrison Co. militia Jan. 
31, 1811. 

14. Thomas Berry was appointed captain of this detachment March 2S, 1811. This 
was an independent company of riflemen — all young men. 



 

The Potawatemie Chief whom I mentioned to have been 
wounded and taken prisoner in my letter of the 8th Instant, 
I left on the Battle ground after having all the care of him 
in my power. I requested him to inform those of his own 
tribe who had joined the Prophet and the Kickapoos and Win- 
nebagoes that if they would immediately abandon the Prophet 
and return to their owti Tribes their past conduct would be 
forgiven and that we would treat them as we formerly had 
done. He assured me that he would do so and that there 
was no doubt of their compliance. Indeed he said that he was 
certain that they would put the Prophet to death. I think 
upon the whole that there will be no further hostilities; but 
of this, I shall be enabled to give you some more certain in- 
formation in a few days. 

The Troops left the Battle ground on the 9th Instant. It 
took every Waggon to transport the wounded. We managed 
however to bring off the public property altho almost all the 
private baggage of the officers was necessarily destroyed. 

It may perhaps be immagined Sir, that some means might 
have been adopted to have made a more early discovery of 
the approach of the enemy to our Camp the morning of the 
7th Instant but if I had employed two thirds of the army as 
our posts it would have been ineffectual. The Indians in 
such a night would have found means to have passed between 
them. Placed in the situation that vfe were there is no other 
mode of avoiding a surprise than by a chain of centenals so 
close together that the enemy cannot pass between without 
discovery, and having the army in such readiness that they 
can get to their alarm posts at a moment's v/arning. Our 
Troops could not have been better prepared than they were 
unless they had been kept under arms the whole night, as 
they lay with their accoutrements on and their arms by 
their sides and the moment they were up they were at their 
posts. If the Centenals and the guards had done their duty 
even the Troops on the left flank would have been prepared 
to receive the Indians. 

I have the Honor to enclose you a correct return of our 
killed and wounded, the wounded suffered very much before 
their arrival here but they are now comfortably fixed and 
every attention has been and shall continue to be paid to them. 
Doct. Foster is not only possessed of great professional merit 
but is moreover a man of feeling and honor. 



 

I am convinced Sir, that the Indians lost many more men 
than we did. They left from thirty six to forty on the field. 
They were seen to take off not only the wounded but the dead. 
An Indian that was killed and scalped in the beginning of the 
action by one of our men was found in a house in the Town. 
Several others were also found in the Houses and many graves 
which were fresh dug, one of them was opened and found to 
contain three dead bodies. 

Our Infantry used principally cartridges containing twelve 
buck shot which were admirably calculated for a night action. 

I have before informed you Sir, that Col. Miller was pro- 
vented by illness from going on the expedition. He rendered 
essential service in the Command of Fort Harrison. He is 
an officer of great merit. 

There are so many circumstances which it is important for 
you to know respecting the situation of this country that I 
have thought it best to commit this dispatch to my aid de 
Camp Major Taylor who will have the honor of delivering 
it to you and who may be able to give you more satisfaction 
than I could do by writing. Major Taylor (who is also one 
of our Supreme Judges) is a man of integrity and Honor, 
and you may rely upon any statements he may make. 

With the Highest Respect I have the Honor to be Sir, 
your Hble. Sevt. 

William Henry Harrison 

P. S. Not a man of ours was taken prisoner & of three 
scalps which were taken two of them were recovered.

Cockrum, Pioneer Histoi-y of Indiana, 271 

The Territorial Legislature [of Indiana] adopted the fol- 
lowing preamble and resolutions on the eighteenth of Novem- 
ber: 



 

Whereas, The services of His Excellency, Governor Har- 
rison, in conducting the army, the gallant defense made by 
the heroes under his immediate command and the fortunate 
result of the battle fouglit with the Confederacy of the Shaw- 
nee Prophet near Tippecanoe on the morning of the seventh 
of November, highly deserves the congratulations of every 
true friend to the interest of this Teri'itoiy and the cause of 
humanity — 

Resolved therefore, that the members of Legislative Coun- 
cil and the House of Representatives will wait upon His Ex- 
cellency the Governor, as he returns to Vincennes, and in 
their own name and of those of their constituents, welcome 
him home. 

and that General W. Johnson be, and is hereby appointed 
a committee to make the same known to the Governor, at the 
head of the army, should not unforeseen causes prevent. 

Brigade Orders 

Brigade Main Quarters 
Vincennes, Nov. 18th, 1811 

Burton, Historical Collection, 176, 177 

The General order of this day dissolves the Brigade which 
I have had the honor to command. 

In taking leave of many of my comrades in arms I cannot 
more strongly evince my exalted opinion of the troops com- 
posing the Brigade than by exhorting them when their coun- 
try calls for their aid to make it their determination to pre- 
serve unblemished the reputation acquired on the morning of 
the 7th when they gallantly defeated the combination of In- 
dians. Sacred be the memory of our gallant brothers who 
gloriously sacrificed their lives for their country on that day. 

Brigade Major [Marston G.] Clarke will be pleased to ac- 
cept of my thanks for his indefatigable zeal in performing 
the duties assigned him. Capt. [George] Croghan's (aid de 
camp to the acting Brigader) firmness on the morning of 
battle and attention to duty merits and receives my warmest 
thanks. 

Signed, JNO. P. BOYD Col. Uh Regt. Infij. A. B. G.

encompassed three parts of the town, the Indians indicating 
by gestures and yells their determination to fight. Two Chiefs

Message to Assembly 

Nov. 19, 1811 

Niles' Register, 1, 321 

Gentlemen of the Legislative Council, and Gentlemen of the 
House of Representatives 

The execution of an order received from the President of 
the United States, at the head of a body of our troops, pre- 
vented me from meeting you at the time to which you were 
prorogued by my last proclamation. Although this circum- 
stance may produce some personal inconvenience to you, and 
perhaps a little additional expense to the territory, it will not 
I am sure be regretted, when it is recollected that the result 
of the expedition which I had the honor to command is a com- 
plete victory over the hostile combination of Indians which 
had been formed by the Shawanese prophet. It is with equal 
pleasure and pride, gentlemen, that I have it in my power to 
inform you that in an action where undaunted valor was con- 
spicuous in every corps, our own militia behaved in a manner 
to do credit to themselves as well as the territory. 

The numerous duties which claim my attention at this time, 
gentlemen, will prevent me from giving my opinion upon such 
subjects as require legislative provision. The most important 
of these, however, you will find discussed at length in my for- 
mer addresses. Permit me to recommend to you industry and 
concord in the discharge of your functions, and be assured of 
my cordial co-operation in every measure which may be cal- 
culated for the benefit of our constituents. 

Wm. H. Harrison 

1. "Three captains, four lieutenants, one ensisn and the surgeon and assistant 
surgeon of the 4th United States* regiment of infanti-y, have published certificates and 
statements relative to the battle of Tippecanoe, near the Wabash, in which the character 
of governor Harrison is represented in the most honorable light. No man has had 
the temerity to impeach the conduct of the governor during the battle ; but many 
have charged him with suffering himself to be surprised ; having, perhaps, formed their 
opinions from the first i-umoi-s of the affair, in which it was stated the centinels were 
shot with poisoned arrows, etc. It seems the gallant little army was not surprised. 
It is true, they were attacked in the night, and that the Indians rushed upon them with 
very great rapidity. But the whole of the men slept on their arms, with their ac- 
coutrements upon them, and the lines were foi-med in from four to six minutes after 
the firing of the first gun, with astonishing regularity and order — this could not have 
been accomplished in a dark night without a precise arrangement predicated upon a 
supposed attack." Niles' Register, II, 56 



 

House of Representatives to Harrison 

November 19, 1811 

Niles Register, I, 322 

To his excellency William Henry Harrison, governor and 
commander-in-chief in and over the Indiana territory 

Sir— The house of representatives of the Indiana territory 
in their own name, and in behalf of their constituents, most 
cordially reciprocate the congratulations of your excellency on 
the glorious result of the late sanguinary conflict with the 
Shawanoe prophet, and the tribes of Indians confederated 
with him: when we see displayed in behalf of our country 
not only the consummate abilities of the general, but the 
heroism of the man ; and where we take into view the benefits 
which must result to that country, from those exertions; we 
cannot for a moment withhold our meed of applause. 

We shall cordially and industriously endeavour to co-operate 
with you sir, in such measures as may best comport with the 
immediate interests of our territory — and although we may 
lament the occasion which gave rise to the necessary delay 
of legislative business, yet we feel it to be our duty as patriots, 
as representatives, and as men, to submit without a murmur to 
any inconvenience which the good of our common country may 
require. Gen. W. JOHNSTON, 

Sjicaker of the house of representatives 

Harrison to House of Representatives 

Nov. 19, 1811 
Niles Register, I, 322 

Gentlemen of the house of representatives 

Believing as I do that the highest reward which a repub- 
lican soldier can receive, is the approbation of his fellow- 
citizens, I cannot be otherwise than highly gratified at the 
applause which you have been pleased to bestow on my con- 
duct as commander of the late expedition. It has ever been 
my wish, gentlemen, to deserve the confidence of your constitu- 
ents. To promote their welfare and happiness, has been, for 
years, the great object of my cares and if in the late action 
it had pleased the Almighty to seal with my life the victory, 
which was to ensure their safety, the sacrifice would have been 
cheerfully made. Wm. H. Harrison

Snelling to Harrison 

Fort Harrison, Nov. 20th 1811 

Hm: Pa. 5 US 

Sir: 

M. [Touissant] Dubois a young man in the contractor [de- 
partment] being about to make a journey to Vincennes has 
offered me an opportunity of communicating to your Excel- 
lency the substance of a conversation I had with a chief [Little 
Eyes] of the Miami tribe who visited me yesterday. He in- 
formed me that when the Delawares went with your last mes- 
sages to the Prophet town he accompanied them and with 
them returned in expectation of meeting you until they dis- 
covered that you had crossed the River they followed and on 
the morning of the action were encamped about one mile from 
us where they distinctly heard the report of our guns; after 
the action was over (as he says) he proposed to his com- 
panions that they should come to our camp but his proposal 
was rejected through that the Kentucky people not knowing 
them for friend might shoot them. He therefore went to the 
Prophet's town where he found the Indians very much exas- 
perated at their loss and reproaching the Prophet in bitter 
terms for the defeat he had brought upon them accusing him 
of the murder of their friend who had fallen &. It seems that 
after pronouncing some enchantment over a composition he 
had prepared on the night preceding the action, he assured 
them that by the power of his art half the army was already 
dead and the other half bewildered or in a state of distraction 



 

and they had nothing to do but rush into the Camp and com- 
plete the work of destruction with the tomahawk. 

You are a liar said one of the Winebagoes to him for you 
told us that the white people were dead or crazy when they 
were all in their senses and fought like the Devil. He ap- 
peared much crest fallen or as Little Eyes described it held 
his head down between his knees, but attempted to pacify 
them by saying that the virtue of his composition was lost in 
consequence of it being with his wife the time of her monthly 
visitation, which circumstance he was unacquainted with until 
after the actions and earnestly entreated them to suffer him 
once more to try his skill, but not withstanding his entreaties 
they bound him with cords and it was the opinion of Little 
eyes they would sacrifice him. The little Kickapoo who spoke 
in council at Vincennes would have shared his fate had he not 
made his escape — parties of their young men were daily out in 
pursuit of him — when they wanted him. First they marched 
only twenty miles and encamped on the Waters of Wild Cat 
Paunch Creek' where they now are. The Pottawattamie Chief 
who was left wounded on the ground made a faithful report 
of what you said to him and it appeared to have a good effect 
upon them. 

All the confederated tribes had abandoned their faith in 
the Prophet except about forty Shawanose who still adhered to 
him. Many of their warriors remained very sick who were 
wounded with buck shot, four of them were wounded with a 
sabre, two severely. From the account given I imagine by 
Capt. [W. C] Baen, Little Eye says they told him one of 
them had shot a soldier and was stooping to scalp him when 
he received a severe wound on his posterior from a stout war- 
rior who was immediately surrounded and slain by four 
others, but not before he had wounded them all, one of them 
with his pistol which shot away all the flesh and muscles from 
the upper part of his arm of which wounds he died the next 
day. 

It gives me pain to inform your Excellency that the bodies 
of our deceased friends were the next day dispossessed of 
their graves and the slain Indians supplied their places and 
it is still more to be regretted that they should have occasion 
to plead the white men's example who they said had disturbed

translates it very well into Wild Cat Paunch creek. It joins the Wabash a few miles 
above Lafayette, from the south.

the graves of their dead. Little Eyes said a Winnegabo told 
him they found fifty slain which was contradicted but I sus- 
pect by the shrewd looks of the Indian when I spoke that he 
had occular demonstration of the fact. 

He requested me to tell his father the Governor that he 
was convinced he was a good and true man that you had told 
them you would go to the Prophet Town but that you would 
not turn aside to the right or left to injure your children, the 
Miamis which promise you had faithfully kept, which the 
Prophet had told them nothing but lies. He also wished me 
to inform your Excellency that in about twenty days there 
would be a great Council of the Delawares, Potawatomies, 
Hurons, and Miamis at a place about sixty miles from this 
post for the purpose of talking of good things, that it was 
their desire to become one people and live in perpetual peace 
with the United States. The Chippeways and Ottoways were 
to meet at the same time on the water of Tippecanoe river, 
that it was their intention to send a deputation to Vincennes 
to inform your Excellency of the result of their Council and 
hear a talk from you. He repi-esented to me that he was in 
a suffering condition for want of powder and earnestly re- 
quested a small supply. I told him it was not in my powei- 
to furnish him nor could I suffer him to purchase it of any 
person in the Garrison until I had received your instructions 
on the subject. 

Mons. Brulette infomis me that just as Little Eye was about 
to depart he told him that Lapoucher, Negro Legs, Stone 
eater. Pecan, The Big Chief, Lorain, and Gamlin- say they 
will not receive annuities from the U. S. because they like 
their land too much to part with it. All the rest of the Chiefs 
are willing to take. 

I know not but all these things I have related may be mere 
trifles but deeming your Excellency knows much better than 
myself in what estimation to hold them, I conceive I should 
be wanting in my duty did I not communicate them. 

Suffer me to intrude on your patience one moment more 
and I have done. I observed in your instructions that I was 
occasionally to furnish the Indians who visit me with pro-

Sir, 

Permit us to convey to you and through you to the officers 
and men of the Regiment you command the exalted sense we 
entertain of the masterly and spirited conduct which you have 
displayed in the engagement with the Indians at Tippicanoe 
and to express the gratitude which fills our hearts for so

many lives which your gallant exertions have contributed to 
preserve. Your near departure from this country prevent a 
more general and public manifestation of these sentiments, 
which are not peculiar to ourselves ; we find them universally 
entertained, and those grave regular's expressions I'epeated 
with enthusiasm by that spirited but untutored Militia who 
witnessed and emulated you cool intrepidity, evince at once 
the importance of the service you have rendered and the 
warmth of their gratitude. 

In endeavouring thus to portray our feelings on the present 
occasion, we present you the only reward it is in our power 
to bestow, the homage of thankfulness and truth, not the less 
gratifying to noble minds for being spontaneous and artless. 

A great good Sir will follow from your example, our fel- 
low citizens will be convinced that valour without science can- 
not however duly exerted lead to certain success and may 
eventually cause an useless effusion of blood, that an armed 
force without the military knowledge is little better than an 
inefficient multitude, and they will learn to submit with cheer- 
fulness to that discipline and subordination which .alone can 
render its efforts consentaneous and irresistible. 

In addressing you thus Sir, we are satisfied that we are 
discharging a duty of sacred justice and will reluctantly take 
leave of you with prayers to the Author of all good, that he 
may long preserve you and your gallant companions in arms 
for the honor and defence of our common country. [See Dec.

Harrison to Secretary op War 

VINCENNES 26th Nov. 1811 
Har. Pa. .5J,0 

Sir: 

Before this reaches you I hope you will have received from 
the hands of my Aid de Camp Major Taylor my official ac- 
count of the late action with the Indians. On examining my 
letter to you of the 5th inst. I find that I had omitted to 
mention the circumstance of my having sent another mis- 
sion of Indians to the Prophet after the return of the Dela- 
ware chiefs. The day that the army left Fort Harrison I 
remained behind for some hours for the purpose of holding 
a conference with the Delaware Miami chief. I had no rea- 
son to doubt the information I had received of the intention 
of the Pi'ophet to burn the first prisoner he should take and 
was apprehensive that I should find much difficulty in open- 
ing a communication with him as my interpretors had become 
so alarmed that I could scarcely get them to the front of the 
army. I proposed to the Delawares that they should send 
three or four of their young men with me to be the bearers 
of an other speech to the Prophet. They agreed to the pro- 
posal and the Miamis then off'ered to go with all their chiefs 
and young men to make another effort to induce the Prophet 
to comply with my demands. I assented to their off"er ex- 
cepting as to the number of persons to be employed. I wanted 
only a few to go they were extremely desirous of going in 
masse and I was obliged peremptorily to declare that not more 
than twenty four should go. This number was at length 
agreed on. The demands which they were to make to the 
Shawanoe — were that— the Winibagoes Potawatomos & Kick- 
apoos who were with him should return to their respective 
Tribes. That all the stolen horses in his possession should 



 

be delivered up — that all the Murderers of our citizens should 
either be given up or satisfactory proof given that they were 
not nor lately been under his control. I did not think proper 
to say anything at that time upon the subject of Hostages. 
I have never had any account of those Indians until I re- 
ceived the inclosed letter from Capt. Snelling whom I left in 
command at Fort Harrison — the account given to the capt 
of the course pursued by these is most assuredly false and 
I should not be surprised to find that our good friends the 
Miamis assisted the Prophet not only with their council but 
with their guns — during the whole of engagement a shower 
of balls was poured into our encampment from persons who 
were at a considerable distance from us in the marshy Prairie 
in front. They were either cowards who did not wish to 
come into danger or person who did not wish to be discovered. 
I have determined however to dissemble my suspicions and 
if possible prevent any further hostilities. I fear however 
that the attitude of our own citizens may defeat my inten- 
tions. They are prodigiously exaspei'ated and raising of our 
dead will make them more so. To increase their forbearance 
I have commanded, threatened and entreated. I have writ- 
ten to Governor Edwards and Gen. Clark to request them to 
send speeches to the Kickapoos of the Prairie urging them to 
withdraw their warriors from the Prophet and have des- 
patched an express to Fort Wayne with instructions to Messrs. 
[John] Shaw and [William] Wells. 

I left Capt. [Josiah] Snelling in the Command of Fort 
Harrison with his own & Posey's Company. The two at that 
time making little more than fifty present fit for duty. The 
rest of the Regular Troops are in quarters in Fort Knox and 
in this Towne. The Militia that were employed upon the ex- 
pedition have all been mustered and discharged but I have 
thought it expedient to retain a company of mounted Rifle- 
men amounting to about fifty which had been turned out a 
few days before I arrived here to patrole round the settle- 
ments. They are posted at Busseron twenty miles above this 
and are still employed in that service. I fear if the other 
Indians commit no depredations that the Winebagos before 
their departure may break into our settlement and steal 
horses if not take scalps. To make it the interest of the 
Miamis & Potawatomies to get these fellows out of the coun- 
try as speedily as posible I have informed them through 



 

Messrs. Wells and Shaw that if we were obliged to send an- 
other army against them we would keep as our own the coun- 
try which we should drive them from. I am at a loss to know 
what to require of them in regard to the Prophet — whether 
to insist upon his being given up — put to death or driven off. 
The objection to the latter is that he may establish himself 
else where but this I am certain will never happen in a man- 
ner to be productive of much injury. The Veil under which 
he has practiced his imposture has been completely rent and 
must discover his true character to the most ignorant of the 
Indians. He has indeed by his avowed determination to stop 
the progress of our settlements acquire astonishing popu- 
larity amongst all the Tribes — a few chiefs excepted who 
were personally opposed to him perhaps there was not an 
Indian who did not wish well to his cause and hence I sus- 
pect that altho his warriors were in the prime of the late 
action will be found that he was supported by an host of 
those who call themselves friends. Nothing proves more 
clearly the treachery of the Miamis than the false informa- 
tion they gave me. They reported positively that the Pota- 
watimies had abandoned the Prophet whereas the fact is that 
they had obtained much strength from the Tribe. All the 
information I received from the Indian Country I shall im- 
mediately transmit to you that the President may be made 
to determine the course which is to be pursued. Under the 
circumstances in which the country is placed I have thought 
it expedient to retain the Command of the Regular Troops 
as well as the Militia and had directed Capt. Snelling to re- 
ceive his order from me. 

All the muster rolls of the Militia Companies will be for- 
warded immediately to the accomptant's office. I have never 
known what pay is due to Dragoons when they furnish their 
own horses. I promised the mounted Riflemen that they 
should receive the same. If I am not mistaken there is a 
law which provides for the payment of horses killed in battle 
— but not for those which were lost or taken. In the course 
of the action a number of the Horses broke loose and ran off 
and were taken by the Indians. An account of these have 
been taken as well as of the saddles that were destroyed. On 
the morning that the Troops marched from the battle Ground 
two wagons were appropriated to bring off the public prop- 
erty the baggage of the officers, the saddles of those who had 



 

lost their horses. It was soon however discovered that- it 
would require every Waggon for the wounded — it became 
therefore necessary to destroy all the private property and 
I had no other alternative to save the Guns of the killed and 
wounded men than to oblige each Dragoon to take one. The 
persons who have lost their horses and saddles in the manner 
above described flatter themselves that remuneration will be 
made them by the Government and I most sincerely hope that 
they may not be disappointed. I am not on this occasion an 
interested advocate. I lost no horse but one that was shot 
dead under my Aid de Camp Major Taylor. That is a case 
which I suppose to be already provided for and with regard 
to my baggage which was destroyed I shall never make a 
charge of it. But many of the men are in such circumstances 
that the loss of a horse and saddle will be severely felt. Every 
description of troops which compose my little army have cer- 
tainly deserved well of their country. Not only for their 
bravery in the field but for their patience under fatigue and 
hunger exposed too to the inclemency of the weather without 
tents and many of them without shoes and with clothing by 
no means suited to the season. I can also state that this is 
the only campaign in the Western country in which the Militia 
were made to work in the erection of forts — For the building 
of Fort Harrison the Militia were regularly detailed with the 
other Troops and besides their quota they furnished two small 
parties of Volunteers who were on constant duty at the more 
particular work of hewing timber and sawing. All the addi- 
tional expence encured by the Public was for the daily fatigue 
an extra gill of whiskey for man and for those on constant 
duty and extra half. 

I am soriy to inform you that several of the wounded men 
have died since Major Taylor left this and several have lost 
their limbs. By some unaccountable accident no bark has 
been sent on in the medicine chests for the 4th Regt. I was 
obliged yesterday to send to Louisville for some. 27th — A re- 
port reached town yesterday that more mischief had been 
done by the Indians about twenty miles off. It is however 
I am confident entirely false. 

With great Respect I am Sir 

your humble servant

My dear Harrison, 

It is with sincere pleasure I have heard of your safe arrival 
at Vincennes with the troops under your command, after the 
rough play you have been engaged in. You have, so far as I 
can learn, acquitted yourself like a man, and the men you com- 
manded have really done wonders, considering the circum- 
stances. 

That you would not be wanting on your part was what every 
one who knew you would naturally expect, and especially one 
who knew your worth as well as I do. I should before this 
have answered your two favors from camp but for want of 
opportunity. My ignorance of the nature and extent of your 
orders, could alone have produced any hesitation in the line of 
conduct I should adopt, as to the supply of volunteers solicited 
from this state. 

For I had taken up the idea you had a right to call for them 
officially, or rather that I should have been warranted in order- 
ing them. For you may rest assured, I should be the last to 
throw cold water on any enterprize you were ordered to exe- 
cute ; for I feel a lively interest in your fame and fortunes. 
Your first letter alone would have been entirely sufficient, as 
to any explanation necessary toward me. I have only to re- 
gret, you had not more sufficient means to complete the chas- 
tisement of a treacherous enemy, and to entirely disappoint 
the views of our old enemy, who have too plainly urged them 
on. I should be pleased to be favored by you with as detailed 
an account of your engagements as your convenience will per- 
mit; and I the more wish this, to be enabled to do you justice 
against the cavils of ignorance or presumption. I am, as I 
ever shall be, your sincere friend.

Annals, 12 Cong., II, 2123 

Sir: 

I have the honor to inform you that two principal chiefs of 
the Kickapoos of the Prairie arrived here bearing a flag on 
the evening before last. They informed me that they came in 
consequence of a message from the Chief of that part of the 
Kickapoos which had joined the Prophet requiring them to do 
so and that the said chief is to be here himself in a day or 
two. The account which they give of the late confederacy 
under the Prophet is as follows — The Prophet with his 
Shawanoes is at a small Huron village about twelve miles from 
his former residence on this side of the Wabash, where also 
were twelve or fifteen Hurons. The Kickapoos are encamped 
near to the Tippecanoe — the Patawatomees have scattered and 
gone to different villages of that Tribe — the Winnebagoes had 
all set out on their return to their owti Country excepting one 
chief and nine men who remained at their former village. 
The latter had attended Tecumseh in his tour to the South- 
ward and had only returned to the Prophet's Town the day be- 
fore the action. The Prophet had sent a messenger to the 
Kickapoos of the Prairie to request that he might be permitted 
to retire to their town. This was positively refused and a 
warning sent to him not to come there. He then sent to re- 
quest that four of his men might attend the Kickapoo chief 
here — this was also refused. These chiefs say on the whole 
that all the Tribes who lost warriors in the late action at- 
tribute their misfortune to the Prophet alone. That they con- 
stantly reproach him with their misfortunes and threaten him 



 

with death. That they are all desirous of making their peace 
with the United States and will send deputations to me for 
that purpose as soon as they are informed that they will be 
well received. The two chiefs further say that they were sent 
by Gov. [Benjamin] Howard [of Mo.] and General [William] 
Clark some time before the action to endeavor to bring off the 
Kickapoos from the Prophet's Town. That they used their 
best endeavor to effect it but unsuccessfully. That the 
Prophet's followers were fully impressed with a belief that 
they could defeat us with ease. That it was thus intended to 
have attacked us at Fort Harrison if we had gone no higher 
—that Raccoon Creek was then fixed on and finally Pine Creek 
and that the latter would probably have been the place if the 
usual road had not been abandoned and a crossing made higher 
up. That the attack made on our centinels at Fort Harrison 
was intended to shut the door against accommodations. That 
the Winnebagos had forty warriors killed in the action and 
the Kickapoos eleven and ten wounded — they have never heard 
how many of the Potawatomies and other Tribes were killed. 
That the Potawatimie Chief left by me on the battle ground 
is since dead of his wounds, but that he faithfully delivered 
my speech to the different Tribes and warmly urged them to 
abandon the Prophet and submit to my terms. 

I cannot say Sir how much of the above may be depended 
on. I believe however that the statement made by the Chief 
is generally correct particularly with regard to the present 
disposition of the Indians. It is certain that our frontiers 
have never enjoyed more profound tranquility than at this 
time. No injury of any kind that I can hear of has been done 
either to the persons or property of our citizens. Before the 
expeditions not a fornight passed over without some vexatious 
depredation being committed. 

I am sorry to inform you that three of our wounded men 
have died in the General Hospital since I last wrote and sev- 
eral have had their limbs taken off. The difficulty which is 
experienced in healing many of the wounds which appear at 
first of no great consequence has excited in Doctor [Josiah] 
Foster's mind as well as my own a suspicion that some of the 
balls were poisoned. It is certain that more of them were 
chewed before they were inserted into rifles for the purpose of 
enlarging the wound and lacerating the contiguous flesh. I 
saw myself numbers of them in the pouches that were taken 



 

from the dead Indians. The Kickapoo chiefs certainly tell an 
vmtruth when they say that there were but eleven of their 
Tribe killed and ten wounded. It is impossible to believe that 
fewer were wounded than killed. They acknowledge however 
that the Indians have never sustained so severe a defeat since 
their acquaintance with the white people.^ 

I have the honor to be with great Respect Sir 
your Humble Servant

Dawson, Harrison, 21fl 

To His Excellency WILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, Governor, and 
Commander in Chief, in, and over the Indiana Territory 

When in the course of human events it becomes necessary 
for a nation to unsheath the sword in defence of any portion 
of its citizens — and any individual of society becomes en- 
trusted with the important charge of leading an army of his 
country into the field to scourge the assailants of its rights — 
and it is proved by the success of that army, that that indi- 
vidual possesses superior capacity, accompanied by integrity 
and other qualities of the mind, which adorn the human char- 
acter in a superlative degree, it has a tendency to draw out 
the affections of the people, in a way that must be grateful to 
the soldier, and the man. Such is the light, Sir, in which you 
have the honor to be viewed by your country, and one which 
the legislative council, and house of representatives of this 
territory think you justly entitled to. 

And, Sir, in duly appreciating your services, we are per- 
fectly sensible of the great benefits and important services ren- 
dered by the officers and soldiers of the United States in- 
fantry under your command. And it is with pleasure we 
learn that the officers and militiamen of our country acted with 
a heroism more than could be reasonably calculated upon from 
men, (such as they generally were) undisciplined, and unac- 
customed to war. 

Resolved, That a joint committee attend to the insertion of 
the foregoing address in the Western Sun for one week.

Elliott to Claus 

Amherstberg, 9th December, 1811 

Niles Register, VI, 359 

The Hon. WilHam Claus, deputy superintendent general and 
deputy inspector general of Indian affairs. 

Dear Sir : — Yesterday I received yours of the 27th ult. by 
two Indians; and until I am furnished with certain intelli- 
gence respecting the Prophet and the Americans, I can only 
inform you that on the third of this month, the report of an 
action between them was contradicted by a Putawatomie 
(Winamaigo) [Winamac] from near the Prophet's village, 
and of his adherents. He says that the Americans are con- 
structing a fort on the Vermillion river, which falls into the 
Wabash below them; but that when he left that place (eight 
days before he arrived here) nothing had been done on either 
side; although the Indians expected soon to be attacked, as 
they had been threatened with being driven out of that coun- 
try, and had sent to all the surrounding nations to call them 
to their aid. I have great reason to believe that what has 
been inserted in the public prints was the same report we had 
here; which, after the lapse of some days without some of 
my confidential Indians arriving, I give no longer credit to. 
I have men among the different nations who will at all times 
give me information of anything of importance ; but in addi- 
tion to those, I now dismiss to the Wabash and to the country 
west of that river, some more faithful men to obtain all in- 
formation possible of the movements of the Americans and 
the Indians. 

I am informed that the collector from Detroit is watching 
the opposite shore to us, from a suspicion of the Indians hav- 
ing received ammunition from us, and to seize it. 

As to the attack upon Detroit, which I am told is garrisoned 
by only 30 or 40 men (at all events not near 100) under cap- 
tain Whistler, who was formerly a British drummer, the at- 
tempt would be useless unless we struck the first blow, and 
take it by assault or surprise. If the Americans commence 
hostilities first, they will previously reinforce Detroit with 
some more regular troops or militia from the state of Ohio or 
Kentucky (for I do not believe they would trust the Canadians 
above Detroit;) and that would be no difficult matter in winter 
when the roads are frozen, when they might also bring for- 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 661 

ward as much provision and as many pieces of artillery as 
they would want. 

My plan would be to have a respectable body of troops here 
to give the Indians confidence in our sincerity; and with five 
hundred of the former, and the same number of the latter, who 
could soon be collected, seize Detroit in the first instance. 
That once done, the Indians, with some regular troops, would 
keep the Americans at bay until all the nations were assem- 
bled ; which they would do immediately. 

The road by which the Americans might and would advance 
from Kentucky, and which is all cleared, passes by the fallen 
timber at Ottaway town on the Auglaive, which falls into 
the Miami of the lake, where the road from Fort Pitt joins it. 
It passes the Miami Bay in the woods, and from Otter Creek 
on the Lake follows said lake to Big Rock and Brownstown. 
Perhaps near where Fort Miami stood would be the best sta- 
tion for annoying an advancing enemy. All the Indians, with 
the exception of a few tragglers, of all the nations within the 
limits of your sketch, may be depended upon; the exact num- 
ber of whom I cannot at present give you ; but the following is 
what I have been able to collect of those living from St. Croix 
river to the Wabash, viz, 

Chippewas 300 

Nodouessies 1000 

Saukies i ^^^ ^^*^' upwards, because 1000 in 
( one party went against the Osages. 

Foxes 1000 

Mashoutas 500 

lowas 200 

Menaumindis 300 

4400 
The situation of their villages it is out of my power to ascer- 
tain. 

The part of the country I was formerly acquainted with has 
entirely changed its face with its masters, and the Indians 
have moved to other parts. The Ottawas of the Miami Bay 
and branches of that river and about Sandusky; are about 800 
men. 

The Americans at Detroit are repairing their fort and 
mounting their cannon thereon, of which they received last 



 

year twelve 24 pounders and about 20 tons of shot, as I have 
been informed. They have also embodied their militia, and 
keep picquets out round the town. 

I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient humble 
servant.

Harrison to Legislature 

December 9, 1811 

Cockrum, Pioneer History of Indiana, 275-7 

Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: 

Your speaker has transmitted to me two resolutions of your 
house expressive of your thanks to Colonel John P. Boyd and 
the officers and soldiers of the Fourth U. S. Regiment, to 
Colonels Bartholomew and Decker and the officers and pri- 
vates of the militia under their command ; also the Kentucky 
volunteers for their bravery and good conduct in the action 
of the seventh of November at the battle of Tippecanoe. [See 
Dec. 4, above] 

It has excited my astonishment and deep regret to find that 
the mounted riflemen of the Territory, who so eminently dis- 
tinguished themselves and the squadron of Dragoons whose 
conduct was also so highly meritorious have, on this occasion, 
been totally neglected. 

I cannot for a moment suppose gentlemen, that you have 
any other wish than that of rendering impartial justice to 
all the corps. I cannot believe that you have the smallest 
tincture of that disposition which certainly elsewhere pre- 
vails to disparage the conduct of the militia and to deprive 
them of their share of the laurels which have been so dearly 
purchased by the blood of some of our best and bravest citi- 
zens. 

No! I can never suppose that it was your intention to 
insult the shades of Spencer, McMahan, and Berry by treat- 
ing with contempt the corps which their deaths have con- 
tributed to immortalize, nor will I believe that a Davis, a 
White, a Randolph and a McMahan have been so soon for- 
gotten, nor that the corps to which they belonged and which 
faithfully performed its duty was deemed unworthy of your 
notice. 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 663 

The ommission was certainly occasioned by a mistake but 
it was a mistake by which, if it is not rectified, the feelings 
of a whole country and part of another, now abounding with 
widows and orphans the unhappy consequence of the late 
action, will be wounded and insulted. 

The victory of the seventh of November, Gentlemen was 
not gained by any one corps but by the eiforts of all. Some 
of them indeed, more particularly distinguished themselves 
and of this number was the U. S. Regiment. In my official 
report to the Secretary of War I have mentioned them in 
such terms of approbation that if stronger are to be found 
in the English language, I am unacquainted with them, but 
I have not given them all the honors of victory. To have done 
so I should have been guilty of a violence of truth, of in- 
justice and of a species of treason against our Republic itself 
whose peculiar and appropriate force is its militia. 

With equal pride and pleasure, then do I pronounce that, 
notwithstanding the regular troops behaved as well as men 
ever did, many of the militia companies were in no wise in- 
ferior to them. Of this number were the mounted riflemen, 
commanded by Captain Spencer. To them was committed 
the charge of defending the right flank of the army. That 
it could not have been committed to better hands, their keep- 
ing their grounds, (indeed gaining upon the enemy) for an 
hour and a half with unequalled arms, against superior num- 
bers, and amid a carnage that might have made veterans 
tremble, is sufficient evidence. Nor can I say that Captain 
Robb's company after it was placed by the side of Spencer's 
was at all inferior to it. It is certain that they kept their 
post and their great loss shows that it was a post of danger. 
The dragoons also did everything that could have been ex- 
pected from them in the situation in which they were placed. 
Before they were mounted, they certainly kept the enemy for 
a considerable time from penetrating the camp by the left 
flank and when mounted, they remained firm at their post 
although exposed to the fire of the enemy at a time when 
they were necessarily inactive and consequently placed in a 
position most trying to troops. 

The failure of the charge made by Major Davis was owing 
to his having employed too small a number, but even with 
these it is more than probable that he would have been suc- 
cessful if he had not unfortunately mistaken the direction in 



 

which the principal part of the enemy lay. A successful 
charge was made, by a detachment of the dragoons at the 
close of the action and the enemy was driven into a swamp 
into which they could not be followed. 

You may perhaps, Gentlemen, suppose that I ought to have 
given you the information necessary to your forming a coi-- 
rect opinion of the merits of each corps. Military etiquette 
however and the custom of our country forbade this. It is 
to the Government of the United States alone that a detailed 
account of an action is made. In this communication I have 
given you such information only as was necessary to enable 
you to correct mistakes which, I am sure, were unintentional 
on your part. 

My sense of the merits of the other corps of the ai'my will 
be known when my official account is published.

Fellow Citizens: 

The joint address of the two houses which was delivered to 
me on the fifteenth inst. by your committee, was received 
with feelings which are more easy for you to conceive than 
for me to describe. Be pleased to accept my sincerest thanks 
for the favorable sentiment you have been pleased to express 
of my conduct as Commander-in Chief of the expedition and 
be assured that the good opinion of the people of Indiana and 
their representatives will ever constitute no small portion of 
my happiness. If anything could add to my gratitude to you, 
Gentlemen, it is the interest you take in the welfare of those 
brave fellows who fought under my command. Your me- 
morial in their favor to the Congress of the United States 
does equal honor to the heads and hearts of those in whose 
name it was sent and is worthy of the Legislature of the 
Indiana Territory.

Sir: 

To show you to what a pitch the Spirit of the Western 
Country has risen I enclose you one out of many letters, on 
the same subject and containing similar offers, which I am 
almost daily receiving- from Kentucky and Tennessee. 

General Jackson (the writer) bears a high Character as a

Har. Pa. 5i9 

With deep and heart felt regret I received the information 
of the loss you sustained on the morning of the seventh in- 
stant, by the attack of the Indians upon your encampment. 
Upon the receipt of this information and hearing that you 
were slowly retreating I issued orders to my respective 
Brigades to hold themselves in readiness to march to your 
support, in case the safety of your frontier and your request 
might make it necessary and proper. 

Should the aid of part of my division be necessary to enable 
you to revenge the blood of our brave heroes, who fell by the 
deceitfull hands of those unrelenting barbarians — I will with 
pleasure march with five hundred or one thousand brave Ten- 
neseans. The blood of our murdered countrymen must be 
revenged. That banditti ought to be swept from the face of 
the earth. I do hope that government will see that it is nec- 
essary to act efliciently, and that this hostile band, which 
must be excited to war, by the secret agents of Great Britain, 
must be destroyed. Should any services be necessary to your 
safety, and that of your Country, by notifying me thereof, 
and at what point I can meet with supplies, I will have the 
number required at a short day at the appointed place. 



 

Being called by imperious business from home for a short 
time, I have directed my aids Major Anderson and Major 
Coffee, to attend Nashville, receive letters to my address and 
should you require men to have them ready and prepare to 
march at my return. You will please address me at Nash- 
ville. 

Accept assurances of my esteem & respect

My Dear Sir : 

I had the pleasure to receive your favor of the 27th ultimo, 
by the mail of Wednesday last and beg you to accept my sin- 
cere thanks for the friendly sentiment it contains. 

You wish me to give you some account of the late action 
that you may be the better enabled to do me justice against 
the cavils of ignorance and presumption. I would do this 
with great pleasure but the legislature of this Territory be- 
ing about to close its session and having an unusual press of 
business I am unable to give you such an account as would 
be satisfactory. There is however less need of this as my 
official account to the Govei'nment will probably reach you 
nearly as soon as this letter. It appears to me from the 
hints contained in some of your newspapers that the charge 
of error in the planning or the execution of the late expedi- 
tion has been more particularly aimed at the President than 
myself. I most sincerely thank this Gentlemen for placing 
me in such good company and it is hardly necessary to in- 
form you that the charge against the administration in this 
instance is as unfounded as in all the others which have flowed 
from the same source. The orders of the Government with 
regard to the expedition wins as much wisdom as humanity. 
It was determined to protect its citizens but if possible to 
spare the effusion of human blood. This last object was pre- 
vented. But by whom? Why in a great measure by those 
very persons who are now complaining because a battle can- 



 

not be won without loss. At least in this Territory the 
clamour is confined to those who opposed the Expedition to 
the utmost of their power and by whose exertions in cir- 
culating every falsehood that malice or rivalry could invent. 
The Militia were prevented from turning out — and instead 
of a force of from 12 to 1500 men which I expected to have 
had I was obliged to march fi'om Fort Harrison with less 
than 880. My personal enemies here united with the British 
agents in representing that the expedition was entirely use- 
less and the Prophet as one of best and most pacific of mor- 
tals, perfect shaker in principle v/ho shuddered at thoughts 
of spilling blood. Every one of his aggressions upon us was 
denied or paliated and excused with as much eagerness as 
is the conduct of Great Britain by this same description of 
people in the Atlantic States. A party sent by the Prophet 
fired upon and wounded one of our centinels upon our own 
ground. The fact was at first boldly denied — the man was 
shot by one of our own people— and I believe it was even 
supposed that he shot himself when the whole circumstance 
was brought to light — these indefatigable gentry shifted their 
ground and asserted that the poor Indian fired in his own 
defence and that he was merely gratifying an innocent curi- 
osity in creeping up to see what was going on in camp and 
that if he had not shot the Sentry the Sentry would have shot 
him. 

I regret exceedingly that the friends of Col. Daviess should 
think it necessary to his fame to suppose a difi'erence of 
opinion between him and myself which never existed that I 
had slighted advice from him which was never given and 
that to give color to this had listened to stories with regard 
to the operation of the army which were absolutely without 
foundation. If the utmost cordiality and friendship did not 
exist between the Colonel and myself from the time of his 
joining the army until his death I have been very much de- 
ceived. If our Military opinions were not almost always in 
unison those which he expressed (and no man who knew him 
will accuse him of hypocracy) was not his own. The Colonel's 
mess-mate, Major G. R. C. Floyd and Capt. Piatt are well 
acquainted with the entire confidence which existed between 
us. They are acquainted with circumstances which indisputa- 
bly establish the fact and they and others loiow that I was the 
object of his Eulogy to an extent which it would be indelicate 



 

in me to repeat. Col. Daviess did indeed advise me to a meas- 
ure the day before the action on which he was joined by all the 
officers around me. Whether the advice was good or bad is 
immaterial to the present description since it was followed 
to the extent that it was given. It is not necessary to ex- 
press my opinion of the Col.'s merits at this time since it will 
be found in my ofiicial letter and I have no doubt that it will 
be satisfactory to his friend. 

With regard to my own conduct my dear Sir it is not in my 
power to enter into a defence of it unless I were to know in 
what particular it has been arraigned. However I may with 
safety rely for my defence upon the opinion of my aimy, be- 
lieving most sincei-ely that you do feel that lively interest in 
my fame and fortunes, which you profess. I am sure you 
will receive with interest the enclosed declaration signed by 
all the field officers of the Amiy one only excepted who was 
absent and the Resolution entered into by the Militia of this 
country who served on the expedition. The testimony of men 
who fought and suffered by my side ought I should suppose to 
be conclusive. 

The idea seems to prevail in your state that in the action of 
the 7th u. the whole army was completely surprised and that 
they were placed in a situation where bravery only decided 
the contest and where there was no opportunity whatever for 
the exercise of military skill of any kind. This was however 
far from being the case. It is true that the two companies 
forming the left angle of the rear line (Bartons & Geigers) 
were attacked before they were formed and that some of the 
men were killed in coming out of their tents but it is equally 
true that all the other companies were formed before they 
were fired on and that even these two companies lost but a 
very few men before they were able to resist. Notwithstand- 
ing the darkness the order of Battle (such as had been pre- 
viously prescribed) was taken by all the Troops. The Officers 
were active the men cool and obedient and perhaps there 
never was an action fought where (for the number of men 
engaged) there were so many changes of position performed. 
Not in disorder and confusion but with military propriety. 
The companies of the Regulars and Militia were extended, 
contracted, wheeled, marched and made to file up by word of 
command. My orders, and these were not a few, were obeyed 
with promptness and preciseness and if I am not more grossly 



 

deceived that mutual dependence which ought to exist be- 
tween a commander and his army was reciprocally felt. 

It has been said that the Indians should have been attacked 
upon our arrival before their town on the evening of the 6th. 
There were two reasons which prevented this, first that the di- 
rections which I received from the Government made it nec- 
essary that I should endeavour if possible to accomplish the 
object of the expedition (the disposition of the Prophets 
force) without bloodshed and secondly — that the success of an 
attack by day upon the Town was very problematical. I cer- 
tainly did not understand my instructions to mean that I 
should jeopardize the safety of the troops by endeavoring to 
bring about and accommodation without fighting. But if I 
had commenced and attack upon them after they had sent a 
chief to inform me that they were desirous of an accommoda- 
tion and that they had three days before sent a deputation to 
mo for that purpose who can doubt but that a much greater 
clamour would have been raised than exists at present — the 
cruelty of attacking those innocent people would have been 
pourtrayed in the strongest colors, the administration would 
have been represented as murderers and myself as their 
wretched instrument. But the army were exposed to the 
"nightly incursions" of the Indians. It has been well ob- 
served by a writer in the Argus? that if "a nightly incursion" 
was really so much to be dreaded by the army it had no busi- 
ness there. But the author of those objections perhaps will 
be still more surprised when he learns that "a nightly incur- 
sion" was precisely what I wished because from such a one 
only could I hope for a close and decisive action. If they had 
attacked us by day they certainly would have done it upon 
ground favorable to their mode of fighting. In night attacks 
discipline always prevails over disorder; the party which is 
able to preseve order longest must succeed. I had with me 
250 regulars that were highly disciplined and my militia had 
been taught to form in order of battle to receive any enemy in 
any direction with facility and precision. "But in the neigh- 
borhood of the enemy why were not the Troops made to con- 
tinue under arms throughout the night"? I answer that 
Troops can only bear a certain portion of fatigue and when in 
the presence of the enemy it is a matter of calculation with the 
Commander when they should be kept under arms and when 
permitted to rest. Upon the occasion I must acknowledge that 



 

my calculations were erroneous. In common with the whole 
army I did believe that they would not attack us that night. 
If it was their intention to attack us why had they not aimed 
upon our march where situation favorable to them might 
easily have been found. Indeed within three miles of the 
town we passed over ground so broken and disadvantageous to 
us that I was obliged to change the position of the Troops sev- 
eral times in the course of a mile. They had fortified their 
Town with care and with astonishing labour for them, and in- 
dicating that they there meant to sustain the shock. It was 
the scene of those mysterious rites which were so much ven- 
erated and the Prophet had taught his followers to believe that 
both his person and his Town were equally inviolable. I ex- 
pected that they would have met me the next day to hear my 
terms but I did not believe however that they would acceed to 
them and it was my determination to attack and burn the 
Town the following night. It was necessary therefore that 
the Troops should be as much refreshed as possible. But al- 
tho the men were not made to remain all night under arms 
every other precaution was used as if an attack had been cei-- 
tain. In fact the troops were placed precisely in that situa- 
tion that is called by military men "lying upon their arms," 
the Regular Troops lay in their lines with their accoutrements 
on and their arms by their sides the Militia had no tents they 
slept with their pouches on and their arms under them to keep 
them dry. The order of encampment was the order of Battle 
for a night attack and as every man slept opposite to his post 
in the line there was nothing for them to do but to rise and 
take their post a few steps in the rear of their fires and the line 
was formed in an instant. So little time was required for this 
operation that if the guard on the left flank had done its duty 
as well as the rest of the army the troops in that flank would 
have been formed before the Indians came near them. It was 
my custom every evening as soon as the army halted to exam- 
ine the ground of the encampment and environs and after- 
wards to call together the field officers of the army and give 
them their directions for the night. At these meetings (where 
everyone was required freely to express their sentiments) 
every contingency that was likely to happen was discussed. 
The advice that were proper to be given to them were then 
by the field officers reported to the Captains. Everyone being 
by those means possessed of my intentions there was no reason 



 

left for mistake or confusion. The orders given on the night 
of the 6th was solely directed to a night attack — the officers 
were directed in case of such an attack to parade their men 
in the order in which they were encamped and thus each Corps 
should maintain its self upon its own ground until other or- 
ders were given. With regulations such as these and with 
such a state of discipline as we claim you must allow my dear 
Sir we had no reason to dread a "night incursion" more than 
an attack by day. Indeed it was preferable because in no 
other could it have been so completely decisive. In the latter 
we might have lost as many men as we did loose without hav- 
ing killed a third as many of the enemy. In my letter to the 
Secretary it is asserted that the Indians had penetrated to the 
center of the encampment I believe however that not more 
than two Indians got within the lines. Men were certainly 
killed near the Center of the Camp but it must have been from 
balls fired from without. 

From this letter and my official despatch to the Secretary of 
War you will be enabled my dear General to form a correct 
opinion of the battle of Tippecanoe. When an action is over 
and we have time to meditate upon the circumstances that 
attended it there is no great judgment necessary to discover 
some error in the conduct of it. Something that was done 
which might have been better done or something that was 
omitted which if done might have produced great advantages. 
I believe the greatest Generals had admitted that they could 
fight a second battle upon the same ground much better than 
the first. If this is true with respect to them ought it not 
to be a motive to shield me from that severity of Criticism 
with which some of my fellow Citizens are desirous of scan- 
ning my conduct. A victory has been gained and the army 
which gained it is due in part at least to the measures of the 
Commander — but this is not sufficient — it should have been 
achieved without loss on our side. There is certainly no man 
more fully impressed with the excellent merits of those brave 
ones who fell in the action than I am; amongst them were 
many for whom I felt the warmest regard and friendship. 
But they were exposed to no dangers but what was common 
to the whole army and if they were selected by divine provi- 
dence as the price of an important victory there is nothing left 
us but to honor their memory and to bow submissively to a 
decree which we cannot alter. It would however bitter the 



 

remaining part of my life if I could suppose that their fate 
was produced by any misconduct of mine. But upon this sub- 
ject I have nothing to accuse myself. I am satisfied that all 
my weak powers were exerted to the utmost for the safety and 
glory of my Troops. Indeed no Commander had ever greater 
reason to do so — for none ever received greater marks and 
confidence and all attachment from an army than I did. Many 
of the Corps forgetful of their own danger seemed only 
anxious for me and a sentiment springing from personal at- 
tachment alone was imputed by them to a belief that their 
fate was intimately connected with mine. For such Troops 
it was impossible that I should not be willing to shed the last 
drop of my blood. 

Your friendship my dear General will pardon egotism con- 
tained in this letter. Perhaps I ought to disregard the idle 
tales that have been circulated to my prejudice — knowing as 
I do that there are not four persons who served under me upon 
the late expedition that will not be ready to contradict them. 
I have not sufficient control however to rest easy under enu- 
merated reproach and with the conciousness of haveing ren- 
dered some services to my country. I cannot bear to be de- 
prived of the good opinion of my fellow Citizens. 

With the greatest Regard I am Sir 

Your friend and Humble Servant.

P. S. I should have covered my troops every night with 
breast work of trees but axes were too scarce (after having 
procured everyone that the Territory afforded) that it was 
with difficulty there a sufficiency of wood could be procured 
to make the men comfortable — and the Militia were without 
tents and many of them without blankets. The story circu- 
lated in some of the papers of officers fighting in their [shirt 
tails] is absolutely untrue. 

1. General Charles Scott was born in Cumberland Co. Va., served with Braddock 
at his defeat in 1755: commanded a regiment under Washington; was with Wayne when 
he stormed Stony Point : surrendered to the British at Charleston, was with St. Clair 
in 1791; commanded a wing under Wayne at Fallen Timbert ; led an e.'cpedition to 
the Wabash in 1791; Gov. of Ky. 1808-1811; died about 1820.

House to Harrison 

December 17, 1811 

Cockrum, Pvjneyr History of Indiana, 278 

His Excellency, William Henry Harrison, Governor and 

Commander-in-Chief of Indiana Territory 
Sir: 

When this house addressed that portion of the troops to 
which you refer in your communication of the ninth inst. it 
was not the intention of this body to cast a shade over any 
portion of the troops which were under the command of Your 
Excellency in the late engagement nor to take from the Com- 
mander-in-Chief, any of that honor which he so nobly ac- 
quired in the late victory. [Dec. 4, above] 

In the joint address of both houses to you their notice of 
the militia in general terms was thought sufficient as it was 
out of their power to notice every man who distinguished him- 
self, therefore it was considered that any evidence of respect 
paid to the Commander-in-Chief was an evidence of approba- 
tion to all. It is not to be supposed that those gentlemen to 
whom particular respect has been paid, have done any more 
than their duty, or that they distinguished themselves any 
more than many private soldiers. Those gentlemen who fell, 
some of them did well and some others had not the opportu- 
nity, being killed to early in the battle, but there is not an 
individual in this body but acknowledges that it was a well 
fought battle and that praises are due; but they generally 
agree that the laurels won principally, ought to be the prop- 
erty of the Commander-inChief. 

President to Congress 

Washington, Dec. 18, 1811 

Annals of Congress, 12th Con., Pa/rt I, 1811-1812, p. 85 

The following Message was received from the President of 
the United States : 

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States : 

I lay before Congress two letters [See Nov. 8, 18, above] 
received from Governor Harrison, of the Indiana Territory, 
reporting the particulars and the issue of the expedition under 



 

his command, of which notice was taken in my communication 
of November 5th. ^ 

While it deeply lamented that so many valuable lives have 
been lost in the action which took place on the 7th ultimo, 
Congress will see, with satisfaction, the dauntless spirit and 
fortitude victoriously displayed by every description of the 
troops engaged, as well as the collected firmness which dis- 
tinguished their commander, on an occasion requiring the ut- 
most exertions of valor and discipline. 

It may reasonably be expected that the good effects of this 
critical defeat and dispersion of a combination of savages, 
which appears to have been spreading to a greater extent, 
will be experienced not only in a cessation of the mui-ders and 
depredations committed on our frontier but in the prevention 
of any hostile incursions otherwise to have been apprehended. 

The families of those brave and patriotic citizens who have 
fallen in this severe conflict, will, doubtless, engage the favor- 
able attention of Congress. -

Sir 

In answer to the call of the honorable committee of the 
House of Representatives, contained in your letter of the 25th 
ultimo, for "all evidence tending to shew what agency the 
subjects of his Britannic Majesty may have had in exciting 
the Indians on the Western frontier to hostility with the 
United States; the evidence of hostility towards the United 
States, on the part of the Shawanee Prophet, and his tribe, 
and which, it is presumed, gave rise to the expedition under 

1. Such a disposition has been made of our land forces, as was thoueht to promise 
the services most appropriate and important. In this disposition is included a force, 
consisting of regulars and militia, embodied in the Indiana Territory, and marched 
towards our Northwestern frontier. This measure was made requisite by the several 
murders and depredations committed by Indians, but more especially by the menacing 
preparations and aspect of a combination of them on the Wabash, under the influence 
and direction of a fanatic of the Shawanese tribe. With these exceptions, the Indian 
tribes retain their peaceable dispositions towards us, and their usual pursuits.

thority, vested in Governor Harrison by the Government of 
the United States, under which the expedition is carried on:" 

I have the honor to state, that the information received by 
this Department, relative to the subjects of inquiry, is con- 
tained in the correspondence of the Governors of the Michi- 
gan, Indiana, and Illinois territories, and of other officers and 
agents of Government, on the Northern and Western frontier, 
extracts from which, embracing the objects of inquiry of the 
honorable committee, together with the memorials of the in- 
habitants of the Indiana and Illinois territories, are herewith 
transmitted. 

On the information and representation of facts, therein 
contained, the 4th regiment of infantry, with one company of 
riflemen, under the command of Colonel [John P.] Boyd, were 
ordered from Pittsburg to Vincennes subject to the further 
orders of Governor Harrison, who was authorized, with this 
force and such additional number of companies from the 
militia as should be deemed necessary, to establish a new post 
on the Wabash, and to march against, and disperse, the armed 
combination under the Prophet.' 

I have the honor to be, with great respect, sir, 
your most obedient servant,

The Governor of the Indiana Territory having been di- 
rected by the President of the United States to take com- 
mand of the Troops destined for an expedition upon the 
Wabash of which the 4th U. S. Regiment formed a part, 
thought proper from the events that had happened and from 
the General aspect of Indian affairs to retain the Command 
after the Troops had returned, and the Militia been dismissed ; 
circumstances have however determined him to relinquish it 
and the U. S. Troops in the Territory are released from all 

1. Along with this were communicated 47 letters or extracts from letters con- 
taining evidence of the Proishefs activity. These letters cover the period from 1807 
to 1811. Extracts of many of these letters are to be found above in their proper place. 
All are given in Am. Sta. Pa. Indian Affairs I, 797-S02. 



 

obligation to receive orders from him; this order embraces 
Capt. [Josiah] Snelling the Commandant of Fort Harrison, 
so far at least as the Connection with the Indians is not con- 
cerned this Department being entirely under the control of 
the Governor the Capt. will still continue to communicate to 
him alone upon that subject. It is however to be considered 
as a voluntary duty but from the knowTi patriotism of the 
Capt. the Governor has no doubt of his performing it with 
cheerfulness, until another arrangement can be made. 

It is almost superfluous for the Governor on this occasion 
to express his sense of the merit of the Troops the command 
of which he has now thought proper to decline ; this has been 
done in a way to do them more honour than they could pos- 
sibly derive from an order of his, the circulation of which 
would not extend beyond the limits of their quarters; he 
cannot however forbear to declare, that although the official 
tie which has for some time connected him with those gal- 
lant troops is now dissolved, he will ever retain for them a 
sincerely afl'ectionate regard and that however distantly sep- 
arated from him they may be, to whatever part of the world 
they may be sent to fight the battles of their country, their 
honor and glory will be always dear to them. 

Doctor [Edward] Scull, [Hosea] Blood and Cummings em- 
ployed by the Governor as Surgeons mates will report them- 
selves to Col. [John P.] Boyd, to remain in the service if he 
should think proper.

On Thursday last the Owl a Miami chief arrived at this 
place, being sent by a party of Indians which are encamped 
about 40 miles from this place to know whether the governor 
would receive a deputation from the Kickapoos and Wine- 
bagos, who were in the late action, and who had sollicted the 
chiefs of the Wea tribe to intercede with the governor to 
grant them and interview. We are informed that the gov- 
ernor declined receiving this visit, and declared that he would 



 

listen to no pi-opositions for peace until the Prophet and all 
his followers, who did not properly belong to the Wabash 
were removed from the country. 

Last evening Mr. McCullough, [a surveyor] whom the Gov. 
had sent express to Ft. Wayne returned, he there saw the 
chief who came to meet the Governor from the Prophet's 
town the night before the action. This man informed Mc- 
Cullough that it was at first intended by the Indians to meet 
the Governor in a conference, as they promised, with the 
intention of assassinating him — That one of the Winebago 
warriors had agreed to devote himself for that purpose, when 
the conference ended he was to watch his opportunity, and 
kill the Governor — when this was done they supposed that the 
army could easily be defeated. The information given by the 
negro who deserted was the occasion of the attack being made 
at night. 

Western Sun, Dec. 21, 1811 

We are sorry to learn that Governor Harrison did, on yes- 
terday^ give up the command of the regular troops stationed 
at this place, and at forts Knox and Harrison — this is the 
more to be regretted, as we are not yet certain of the real 
disposition of the Indians towards us — should they attack us 
the Governor's services as commander, will, unquestionably 
be much needed— past experience so incontestibly proves the 
importance of his services, that we are of opinion the people, 
for their own sofety ought to unite in prayer to him to re- 
sume it — and thereby give them a man & a commander whom 
they know, & in whom they could justly confide — It is more- 
over to be lamented, because we understand that no immedi- 
ate communication from the oflicer commanding at fort Hai-- 
rison, can regularly be made to the Governor, as to any in- 
formation he may obtain, and it is all important that com- 
munication of that kind should be made to one who under- 
stands Indian afi:airs, and has the interest of the territory, 
and the safety of people at heart. We are, however glad to 
have it in our power to say that the governor's conduct dur- 
ing the late campaign exhibited so conspicuously the general, 
and the man of worth that it endeared him to every officer of 
the regular troops, with perhaps only one exception [Boyd].

Resolutions — Dec. 7, 1811 

(At the request of a number of subscribers we are induced 
to republish the following : ) 

At a numerous meeting, (public notice for that purpose 
being given) of the Officers and Non-commissioned officers, 
or privates of the Militia corps (Hargrove's company ex- 
cepted) of the county of Knox which served on the late cam- 
paign under Gov. Harrison met at Beckes's Inn in Vincennes 
on the 7th December, 1811, Col. Luke Decker was appointed 
Chairman and Maj. Benjamin Parke, Clerk. 

A paper purporting to be "an address from a number of 
the citizen of Vincennes and its vicinity" and signed by Henry 
Vanderburgh, as Chairman to Col. John P. Boyd, being read, 
the following resolutions were unanimously agreed to. [Nov. 
2.5, above] 

1. Resolved unamiously , that we cannot consider the said 
Address in any other light than as one amongst the many 
attempts which have flowed from the same source, to wound 
the feelings and injure the character of Governor Harrison. 

2. Resolved, That the said Address in attempting to be- 
stow the merit of the masterly conduct in the direction and 
manoevering of the troops in the late action to any other 
than the Commander in chief asserts a notorious untruth, 
which will be acknowledged as such by the whole army. 

3. That our indignation is justly excited at the false and 
contemptuous manner in which the Militki who served under 
Governor Harrison are treated, in the said address; being 
there represented as an untutored, undisciplined band pos- 
sessing indeed courage, but none of the other requisites of 
soldiers; and owing eternal gratitude to the Col. Boyd and 
his Regiment, for the preservation of their lives. 

4. That the Militia which served under Governor Har- 
rison were neither untutored nor rindisciplined, but in com- 
mon with the Regular troops, they shared the attention of the 
Commander in Chief, and that by his personal exertions, both 
the Militia and Regulars were brought to a state of perfec- 
tion in that kind of manoevering calculated for Indian war- 
fare, and that they were enabled to perform all the directions 
of the Commander in Chief with promptness, facility, and 
precision. 



 

5. That it is a notorious fact, knowri to the whole army 
that all the changes of position made by the troops during 
the action of the 7th ult. and by which the victory was se- 
cured, were made by the direction of the Commander in Chief, 
and generally executed under his immediate superintendence. 

6. That we cannot but view as a most dangerous usurpa- 
tion, the meeting of a few individuals, not more than from 
seven to ten, in a private house, without any previous or 
public notice being given and to pass resolutions and ad- 
dresses in the name of a neighborhood. And we do further 
view the conduct of said individuals (almost every one of 
whom are the avowed enemies of the Commander in Chief — 
and several of whom have uniformly discountenanced and 
opposed every measure of the government, in respect to the 
Shawanoe Prophet and his party, and none of whom were on 
the Campaign) in daring to speak in the name of the Militia, 
as highly presumptions and unwarrantable. 

7. That it was owing to the skill and valor of the Com- 
mander in Chief that the victory of Tippecanoe was obtained. 

8. That we have the most perfect confidence in the Com- 
mander in Chief, and shall always feel a cheerfulness in serv- 
ing under him whenever the exigences of the country may 
require it. 

9. That we would prefer serving under him to any person 
that could be designated by the government for that purpose. 

10. That when commanded by him, honor will be achieved ; 
and we have every confidence that victory will be obtained. 

11. That in expressing the above opinions, in respect to 
the reprehensible conduct of the Addressers, we desire it to 
be definetly understood that we have no idea of wounding the 
feelings, or injuring the character of Col. Boyd that we are 
free to declare, that we believe his conduct during the action 
to have been that of a gentlemen and a soldier. 

12. That we feel the highest respect, and shall always 
recollect with gratitude, our brothers in arms, the Officers 
and Privates of the U. S. Troops. — We have often heard. We 
Jmve now seen what Yankees can do! 

13. That in obeying our country's call we shall feel a proud 
satisfaction in being associated with Kentucky volunteers. 

14. That the above resolutions be inserted in the Western 
Sun — and that such Printers as may give publicity to the 



 

Addresses above mentioned, be requested to publish also the 
aforesaid resolutions.

Indian Loss at Tippecanoe 

Captain [Josiah] Snelling, the commandant of Fort Har- 
rison, arrived here a few days ago — the captain has had an 
opportunity of conversing with a number of the Indians, who 
were in the late action, and has taken much pains to ascer- 
tain the number that fought aginst our troops. He put down 
on paper the number of each tribe as gave by each individual. 
The one which gave the least, made the amount 569, and he 
who gave the most to upward of 700. They belonged to the 
Kickapoo, Wyandot, Potawatimies, Piankeshaws, Shawanoes, 
Muscos, Wyandots, (or Hurons) Ottawas and Chipewa tribes.

Resolutions 

Dec. 27, 1811 

The mounted volunteer Riflemen at gen. Samuel Wells's^ on 
the 27th of December, 1811, for the purpose of partaking a 
dinner with the general. After appointing capt. James 
Hunter^ chairman and Major Isaac R. Gwathmey= secretaiy, 
a letter addressed to col. [John P.] Boyd with Henry Vander- 
burgh as signer — and also the resolutions adopted on the 7th 
of Dec. 1811, by the officers, non-commissioned officers and 
privates of the militia corps of Knox county, Indiana Terri- 
tory were then read to capt. Geiger and his company — when 
the following resolutions were unanimously agreed to. 

1. Resolved, That we the volunteers who fought in the late 
battle on the Wabash under the command of Col. Frederick 
Geiger, do with heartfelt satisfaction, highly approve of the 
resolutions adopted by our brother officers and soldiers at Vin- 
cennes, on the 7th of Dec. 1811. 



 

2. Resolved, That that part of the letter of Henry Vander- 
burgh/ which says that the militia were an untutored and un- 
disciplined band, is considered by us as a groundless and 
malicious falsehood, and is calculated to take from them (the 
militia) the never-fading laurels they won by their heroism, 
their braveiy and their firmness. 

3. Resolved, That we view the address of Henry Vander- 
burgh, as an unjustifiable attempt to wound the feelings of the 
commander in chief of the late expedition. And that we are 
ready and willing whenever our country calls, to volunteer 
under the same commander. 

4. Resolved, That the Editor of the TFesierw Courrier, be 
requested to give the proceedings of this meeting publicity in 
his paper.

Harrison to Secretary of War 

ViNCENNES 24th Dec. 1811 
Har. Pa. 553 

Sir: 

The enemies of the Administration in Kentucky have en- 
deavored to raise a clammour from some supposed defect in 
the planning or in the execution of the late expedition. Altho, 
I believe that the people generally pay very little attention to 
what these gentry say, I have never yet thought it proper 
to elucidate some of the circumstances which have caused their 
animadversion in a letter to my friend, Gov. Scott, a copy of 
which I have the honor herewith to enclose. [See Dec. 13, 
above] I cannot believe that any man of judgment who is the 
least acquainted with Indian warfare and who knew the 
strength of the position occupied by the Indians, can suppose 
that we could have gained any thing by attacking the Town on 
the evening of our arrival We might have carried it, but I am 
fully persuaded that our loss would have been much greater 
than it was. Indeed had we fought them any where by day 
upon ground of their own choosing we should I believe have 
beaten them, but their loss of men would have been compara- 
tively small to ours. This has been the case in every action of 
note that has been fought with the Indians. General [Josiah] 
Harmer plumed himself upon having killed one third or one 
fourth as many Indians as they killed of his men and in the 
action of Gen. [Anthony] Wayne, one hundred and thirty or 
forty of our men were killed and wounded and I am persuaded 
that there were not more than twenty Indians killed. When 
pressed by our troops they escaped with so much agility that 
altho there were little short of 2000 Dragoons and mounted 
riflemen they were not able to overtake them. So great were 
the advantages which I supposed we should derive in a night 
attack from our discipline, our bayonets and buckshot that I 
must confess I had no idea that we should ever be attacked in 
that way. I should however blush at my own want of pru- 
dence if any thing was omitted to guard against the success of 
such an attack which ought to have been done upon the prob- 
abilities which I had before me that it would be made. If I 
had placed pickets of observation without any chain of senti- 
nels, it would have been easy for the enemy to evade them, 
or to have cut them off. Our safety consisted in having the 



 

Troops prepared for action at a moments warning. They 
could not have been better prepared unless I had made them 
pass the whole night under armes. I confess that I had no 
idea that this was more necessary than it had been for many 
nights before. Indeed I thought it less so and I believe that 
I may with safety say that there was not an officer, perhaps 
not a man, in the Camp of a different opinion. But notwith- 
standing this the order of encampment was intended to resist 
a night attack. The orders given were directed to the same 
point. The great facility with which the troops were formed 
shows that they had been well instructed and well understood 
what they were to do and excepting the two Companies of 
Barton and Guiger, the rest of the Troops could not have been 
in better order than they were in when they were fired on, 
if they had stood at their posts the whole night 

Since I had the honor to write to you by the last mail the Owl 
a celebrated Miami Chief arrived here, to know whether I 
would receive some Winnebagos and Kickapoos, who were 
waiting his return at about a days journey from this with sev- 
eral of the Wea Chiefs. My answer was that I did not wish 
to see them here at present — being anxious to know the Presi- 
dents determination with regard to them before I took any 
further measures. The Owl confirms the opinion which I 
had before entertained that all the Potawatamies who reside 
on the Wabash (excepting the Chief Winenac) were in the 
action. He says he saw the warriors from both the Villages 
above the Prophets Town going to join him the day before 
the action and that it was with the greatest difficulty that the 
young men of his own Tribe could be prevented from joining 
him also. Amongst the Potawatamies were some men whom 
I had particularly cherished — indeed the chiefs and warriors 
of both those villages had partaken more largely of the bounty 
of the U. States dispensed by my hand, than any other. Their 
conduct and that of the Miamis unequivocally prove that the 
inclinations of the Indians were entirely on the side of the 
Prophet and that it was high time their establishment was 
broken up. My opinion is that they should not too easily be 
admitted to our favor again and I regret exceedingly that Mr. 
[John] Johnson should have been so precipitate in delivering 
the annuities at Fort Wayne. I have temporized with the 
Indians for the purpose of gaining time, that the Government 
may decide what is to be done. The course that I would rec- 



 

ommend is that the Miamis, Potawatamies and Kickapoos be 
made to drive off the Prophet and all the strange Indians from 
the Wabash. It may however be necessary to embody a re- 
spectable force to back them and to prevent those Vagabonds 
from turning upon our settlements. All the accounts that I 
have received from the Indian Country agree in stating the 
entire dispondence of the Prophets party and their disinclina- 
tion for further hostilities It is however pretty certain that 
the Winegabos have not returned home as the Kickapoos as- 
serted and it is possible that the return of Tecumseh, who is 
daily expected will produce other dispositions. 

In my letter of the 26th ult. I had the honor to inform you 
that from the aspect of our relations with the Indians I had 
determined to retain the command of the troops until I should 
hear from you. As however the Militia have all been dis- 
missed and no immediate danger apprehended I have relin- 
quished the control over them which I had retained. But 
upon the occurrence of any event to make it necessary or upon 
the receipt of your orders to that effect I will with cheerfull- 
ness resume it. There is indeed but a single circumstance' 
which makes the command disagreeable to me. 

I have the Honor to be with great respect Sir 
Your Humble Servant

Sir, 

By the arrival of major [Waller] Taylor, on the 16th in- 
stant, your Excellency's despatches of the 18th of November, 
containing a particular account of the battle of the 7th, were 
received. The message of the president to congress, [See 
Dec. 18, above] herewith enclosed, will convey to your Excel- 
lency the high sense entertained by the executive, of the 
gallantry and good conduct of all the troops engaged in the 
expedition. And I "am instructed, by the president, to com- 

1. This doubtless refers to the restlessness of Colonel Boyd and the agitation at 
Vincennes as shown by the Vanderburs letter. In Kentucky Humphrey Marshall was 
the chief and almost the only critic of Harrison. 



 

municate to you, Sir, and through you to the officers and men, 
of the respective corps, his thanks, for the persevering zeal 
and bravery displayed in the action. The encomium bestowed 
by your Excellency on the regular troops, appears to have been 
justly due to the discipline, firmness, and valor with which 
the action was sustained on their part, and reflects the highest 
honor on colonel Boyd and his officers. 

It is presumed that the eff"ects of this defeat will be experi- 
enced in a return of the Indians to their former friendly dis- 
position, and in a prevention of future aggressions. The 
course remaining to be pursued with them will depend, in a 
great measure, on further indications of their meditated con- 
duct, and is under consideration. In the meantime, your Ex- 
cellency will continue to communicate every information, and 
to adopt such measures as exigencies may require. 

I have the honor to be, your Excel'ys, most ob't servant.

Sir: 

A. W. Fowler arrived here from New Port the evening be- 
fore last with some groceries, medicine, and other necessaries 
for the sick and wounded. Nothing of this kind has been 
wanting hitherto and I am happy to inform you that all the 
wounded, one perhaps only excepted, are in a fair way to re- 
cover and that there has been but one death within the last 
fortnight. The enclosed letter from Captain [Josiah] Snell- 
ing [See Nov. 20, above] with the Indian talks which it con- 
tains, came to me by an express since the Departure of the 
last mail. It is another evidence of the complete discomfiture 
of the Prophets party. I have desired Capt. Snelling to per- 
mit the Stone Eater only to come here, by whom I will send 
an answer to the others. Before he leaves this I hope to re- 
ceive your directions with regard to the course which is to be 
pursued with the late hostile Indians. 

It is impossible Sir, that I should be insensible to the torrent 
of abuse which has been levelled at me by some of the papers. 



 

What we call here a glorious victory — such a one as in the 
opinion of Gov. Edwards, Gov. Howard, Gen Clark, and gen- 
erally of the whole mass of citizens will produce the most im- 
portant beneficial consequences to the western country and to 
the U. States, has been termed a "most distressing disaster", 
a "horible butchery". If these observations had been confined 
to the federal prints I should have disregarded them but none 
of them have been more rancourous than the paper called the 
Baltimore Whig. In my ofticial accounts it has been my aim 
to conceal no circumstance whatever even if it should militate 
against myself. I have indeed made statements which have 
had that tendency when there was no necessity for it and 
which upon further enquiry I found to be totally incorrect. I 
have asserted that the Indians penetrated to and killed men 
near the center of the Camp. I was led to the error because 
I knew that a few Indians had entered camp. I now find 
that there [were] but two, at most, who had passed into the 
camp near the left angle but they were killed within twenty 
yards of the line and I knew also that men were killed and 
wounded quite in the Interior of the Camp but every one 
agrees that it must have been from balls that came from with- 
out. 

I have said also that men were killed coming out of their 
tents. Capt. Barton informs me that the two Tents on the 
right of his Company were fired into before the men got out, 
but the rest were formed before they received any injury. 
Capt. Geiger had but one Tent — one of his men was killed 
in the mouth of this and another killed an Indian — and this 
with a slight wound himself, was all the injuiy his company 
received until they were formed in the rear of their fires. 
Thirteen men who joined us the day before the action were 
attached to Geigers Company and posted on his left, joining to 
Bartons were bi'oken and run off" on the first alarm, (two or 
three excepted) and it was this circumstance which caused the 
great injury to Bartons Company. I do aver that the Troops 
upon the front rear and right flank were completely formed 
before they were fired on. The left flank which suff'ered most 
were formed some minutes before they received a shot. It 
could not have been more than one minute and an half from 
the first alarm, (and Mr. Adams who attended me thinks it 
was not as long) before I led up myself two companies, com- 
pletely formed to the assistance of Barton and Geiger. But 



 

admitting that something more might have been done by me 
to ascertain the approach of the enemy, it appears from the 
above statement, that we sustained very little injury by the 
suddenness of their attack. In my letter from the Battle 
ground I have said that there was at first some little confusion 
before the Troops were formed. I read this letter to Col. 
Boyd at the time and he asserted that there was none, that 
there never was an army formed quicker or in better order. 
It is possible that the Col. may since have changed his opinion 
— with regard to my own conduct and the measures taken to 
secure the victory after the action commenced. I must refer 
you to the Declaration of the field officers and the Resolutions 
of six Militia Companies herewith enclosed. I have been 
very much misinformed if the sentiments they contain are not 
common to all the Plattoon officers of the 4th Regt. 
I have the Honor to be very respectfully Sir 
Your faithful Servant 

William JIenry Harrison 

P, S. For the satisfaction of the people I have caused the 
letter from Capt. Snelling and the Indian Speeches to be pub- 
lished and having no one at hand to copy them I have enclosed 
herewith the newspaper which contains them. [See Dec. 21, 
above]

The Honble Secretary of War 



Adams to Harrison 

(Dec. 1811) 

Dawson, Harrison, 2It2 

Sir, 

In answer to the question, which your Excellency has put 
to me, 'Do you know, or have you ever heard, that any other 
companies than those of Bigger and Robb had abandoned 
their stations in the action ?' I must state, that I neither know, 
nor have heard, of any other companies who had deserted 
their posts; nor do I conceive, that those companies can justly 
be considered to have abandoned their posts, as Bigger's was 
certainly attacked in front, flank, and rear; their captain on 
guard, and themselves overpowered by numbei-s. Robb's com- 
pany, in common with the whole of that flank, may also justly 



 

be said to have given away before superior numbers. It was 
rallied and taken to the right flank, where they manfully sus- 
tained the repeated attacks of the savages until the close of 
the action, and suffered severely, as their list of killed and 
wounded will show, which answers, also, your Excellency's 
second question, viz: 'Do you not know, or have you sufli- 
cient reason to believe from what you have heard, that Robb's 
company was rallied and removed to the right flank, where 
in a post of great danger, it continued to discharge its duty 
until the close of the action?' In answer to the third ques- 
tion, 'Do you know, or have you ever heard, that any militia 
officer or soldier was killed or wounded behind, or under 
wagons, or behind trees, were on or near the line, and where, 
of course, it was proper for riflemen to be?' I must declare, 
I neither knew, nor ever heard, that any officer or soldier was 
wounded or killed behind trees or wagons. Most of those 
who were wounded, retired to the centre of the camp, which 
may have led those, who superficially obsei-ved things, to sup- • 
pose that they were there wounded ; such people, also, might 
have mistaken wagoners, men in the contractor's and quar- 
termaster's department, who were but few, whose duty called 
them about the wagons, for those who had fled from their 
posts. It must be, indeed, a source of regret to your Excel- 
lency, to find people, who are, perhaps, not the most deserv- 
ing, striving to rend in pieces the laurel wreath, which your 
little army so gallantly won, merely because they cannot be 
the exclusive owners. For them should be wove the wreath 
of discord, labelled with dissension, folly, and madness, on 
its front; that such may no more disturb where you com- 
mand, is. Sir, the wish of your obedient servant.

Captain 4th regt., adjutant of the army on the expedition 

Harrison to Dr. John Scott 

(Dec. 1811) 
Dawson, Hamson, 23U 
You say that you are astonished at my escape, and that 
you had calculated with certainty upon my fall in the event 
of an action with the Indians, from the circumstance of my 
being known to every Indian who was opposed to us. It is 
really astonishing to myself, and I consider my life as having 



 

been most providentially preserved. I had, indeed, many 
more chances to run than any other individual, as well from 
the circumstance which you mention as from the attempts of 
treacheiy, the first efforts of which would unquestionably 
have been directed against me. The first plan laid by the 
prophet and his chiefs was that which you have heard, of 
meeting me in council and procuring my assassination by 
means of two Winebagoes who had devoted themselves to that 
object. Had this plan been persevered in, whatever might 
have been the fate of the army, I, at least should have fallen. 
When this scheme was abandoned and an attack determined 
on, I am perfectly convinced that they intended to have first 
despatched me by means of the above mentioned negro, who 
was either to have done it himself, or conducted some of the 
Indians into camp for the purpose of effecting it. The latter 
is most probable, and would not have been very difficult of 
execution. A few Indians might have passed undiscovered 
-between the militia centinels, who, you know, are not very 
remarkable for their vigilance, as the negro himself did ; and 
being once within the lines, there was scarcely any further 
obstacle. For instead of the officer's guard to which my rank 
entitled me I had contented myself with a single dismounted 
dragoon centinel, and that more for the purpose of overlook- 
ing the horses and baggage wagon than any security to my- 
self. Ben had escaped all notice and was within a few yards 
of my quarters, making his observations, when captain Wil- 
son providentially approached him from behind and secured 
him. Had it not been for the captain's visit to me at that 
late hour, or had it been delayed but for a few moments, he 
would no doubt have escaped. He was tried the next morning, 
and the court unanimously sentenced him to suffer death. I ap- 
proved of the sentence and intended to have it executed in 
an hour; but the hour elapsed and another passed by. I ex- 
cused the delay to my own mind from the circumstance of 
the troops being engaged in fortifying the camp, and could 
not be called out to witness the execution. But the fact was 
that I began to pity him, and I could not screw myself up to 
the point of giving the fatal order. If he had been out of 
my sight he would have been executed. But when he was 
first taken, general Wells and colonel Owen, who were old 
Indian fighters, as we had not irons to put on him, had se- 
cured him a-la-mode de savage. This is done by throwing 



 

the person on his back, splitting a log and cutting notches 
in it to receive the ankles, then replacing the severed parts 
and compressing them together with forks driven over the 
log into the ground; the arms extended and tied to stakes 
secured in the same manner. The situation of a person thus 
placed is as uneasy a one as can possibly be conceived. The 
poor wretch thus confined, lay before my fire, his face re- 
ceiving the rain which occasionally fell, and his eyes con- 
stantly turned upon me as if imploring mercy. I could not 
withstand the appeal and I determined to give him another 
chance for his life. I had all the commissioned officers as- 
sembled and told them that his fate depended on them. Some 
were for executing him, and I believe that the majority would 
have been against him but for the interference of the gal- 
lant Snelling. 'Brave comrades,' said he, 'let us save him. 
The wretch deserves to die; but as our commander, whose 
life was more particularly his object, is willing to spare him, 
let us also forgive him. I hope, at least, that every officer of 
the fourth regiment will be upon the side of mercy.' Snelling 
prevailed, and Ben was brought to this place where he was 
discharged. To those who may censure me for pardoning 
Ben, you can state the circumstance of general Wayne's par- 
doning Antoine Lasselle, who, you know, was not only found 
fighting with the Indians against us, but actually hid within 
our lines, and although he was condemned as a spy, he was 
pardoned by the general. I have yet another providential 
interference in my favor to mention. I had in the campaign, 
for my own riding, a grey mare and a sorrel horse. They 
were both fine riding nags, but the mare was uncommonly 
spirited and alive. I generally rode them alternately, day and 
day about. On the day we got to the town I was on the mare, 
and as it was our invariable rule to have the horses saddled 
and bridled through the night, the saddle was kept upon her, 
and, like the other horses belonging to my family, she was 
tied to a picket driven into the ground in the I'ear of my 
marquee and between that and the baggage wagon. In the 
night the mare pulled up the picket and got loose. The 
dragoon centinel awakening my servant George, the latter 
caught the mare and tied her to the wagon wheel on the 
back side. When the alarm took place I called for the mare. 
George being aroused from his sleep and confoundedly fright- 
ened, forgot that he had removed her to the other side of the 



 

wagon and was unable to find her. In the mean time major 
Taylor's sei-vant had brought up his horse. The major ob- 
served that I had better mount him, and he would get another 
and follow me. I did so. Poor Owen accompanied me, 
mounted upon a remarkably white horse. Before we got to 
the angle which was first attacked, Owen was killed. I at 
that time supposed that it was a ball which had passed over 
the heads of the infantry that had killed him; but I am pur- 
suaded that he was killed by one of the two Indians who got 
within the lines, and that it was extremely probable that 
they mistook him for me. Taylor joined me in a few minutes 
after, mounted on my grey mare. I immediately directed him 
to go and get another. He returned to my quarters, and pre- 
ferring my sorrel horse to another of his own that was there, 
mounted him, and we thus continued on each others' horses, 
till near the close of the action. Being then with both my 
aid-de-camps, Taylor and Hurst, in the rear of the right flank 
line, the fire of several Indians near to the line was directed 
at us. One of their balls killed the horse that Taylor was 
riding, and another passed through the sleeve of his coat, a 
third wounded the horse I was riding in the head, and a 
fourth was very near terminating my earthly career. Now, 
what a singular combination of circumstances happened to 
save me. If I had been mounted on my grey mare I should 
have inevitably been killed, and I should have been on her 
if she had not broken loose in the night, or if, after being 
caught she had been tied where the other horses were, or 
if my servant had recollected where he had tied her. It oc- 
curred to none of us that it was dangerous to be on a white 
animal until after Owen fell, or he would not have been suf- 
fered to ride his own white horse, as there were several spare 
ones belonging to my own family. I have seen a paragraph 
in one of the papers stating that 'the white horse on which 
I had ridden the day before the action, was riddled with balls,' 
this is not the fact ; neither colonel Owens' horse, which colonel 
Wells has since taken home to his widow, or my mare were 
touched with a ball, and no one was upon the mare during the 
action but major Taylor, and he only for a minute or two.

PREFACE 

When the Author of the succeeding pages had determined 
on recording the events and operations of the Regiment to 
which he belonged, it was far from his intention to give them 
publicity. They were noted down for the amusement of his 
leisure hours and the perusal of his Friends, when he should 
return from the toils of the Camp and the fatigues of war ; — 
to portray to the view of those Friends the various vicissi- 
tudes of fate attendant on the life of a Soldier. — But since 
his return, many who have perused the manuscript, have ex- 
pressed their ardent desire to see it published, and to gratify 
their wishes, he has been induced to submit it to the press. — 
He indulges the hope that his simple narrative will fall into 
the hands of none but the candid and liberal, who affect not 
to despise the humble and unvarnished tale of the Private 
Soldier. 

The Author 



JOURNAL' 

The 4th Regiment of U. S. Infantry was raised principally in the 
year 1808 — from the five New England States, viz.: Vermont, New 
Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, and consisted 
of between 800 and 900 men — under the command of Colonel John P. 
Boyd. The regiment was not embodied until 

April 29, 1811. — When we received orders from Government to 
rendezvous at the Lazaret to Barracks on the Schuylkill, five miles below 
Philadelphia. Captain Whitney's Company of U. S. Riflemen, then sta- 
tioned at Newport, R. I., was also ordered to join the 4th Regiment at 
this place. 

May 24. — The whole regiment (except one company under Captain 
Rannie, which were detained at Marblehead) had arrived, and were im- 
mediately formed, consisting of about 600 of as noble fellows as ever 
trod the tented field; all in good health and fine spirits, and their 
discipline unrivalled; nothing worthy of note took place while we re- 
mained here, which was but a few days, except the degrading situa- 
tion in which Captain Whitney of the riflemen had placed himself while 
commanding officer, by descending to the level of a musician, and with 
his own hands bestowing corporeal punishment upon the bare posteriors 
of two privates of his company, in the face of the whole regiment on 
parade. Such conduct in a commander, merited, and received the pointed 
scorn of every officer of the regiment. The two men, who had hereto- 
fore been good soldiers, deserted within two hours after receiving their 
punishment — and a few days afterwards Captain Whitney resigned a 
command he was totally unworthy of and returned home. Lieutenant 
A. Hawkins, a fine officer, was afterwards appointed to the command of 
this company. We received our tents, camp equipage, &c., and Colonel 
Boyd and Lieutenant Colonel Miller having arrived to take the com- 
mand — On the 

3d June, 1811, we commenced our march for Pittsburgh. Crowds 
of spectators from the city of Philadelphia came to witness our de- 
parture; the day was extremely waim and we were almost suffocated 
with heat and dust. We marched five miles from the city and en- 
camped about 4 o'clock. Many respectable citizens from Philadelphia 
accompanied us to our encampment. 

I omit the particulars of our march through the state of Pennsyl- 
vania, as no event transpired except what falls to the lot of all soldiers 
on long marches. The country being extremely rough and mountainous, 
our shoulders pressed beneath the weight of our cumbrous knapsacks, 
our feet swollen and blistered, and performing toilsome marches be- 
neath a burning sun, amid clouds of dust, in the warmest season of the 
year, rendered our situation painful in the extreme and at times almost 
insupportable. A number of desertions took place on this march, in 
consequence of its having been whispered among the troops that they 

furnished by the Libraiy o( Congiess and printed 



 

were to be sent to New Orleans — and it is believed, had not Colonel 
Miller given them to understand that no such thing was intended, one- 
third, at least, of the regiment would never have reached Pittsburgh. 
However, placing unbounded confidence in the word and honor of Colonel 
Miller, order was restored and the fears of the men were calmed. 

On the 10th June we arrived at Carlisle, a handsome little town 
about 120 miles from Philadelphia, where we halted one day to refresh 
and rest our wearied limbs. 

June 12th we again proceeded on our march and arrived at the 
beautiful town of Pittsburgh on the 28th June, 1811. At Pittsburgh 
we found excellent quarters, necessaries of all kinds, cheap and plenty; 
— The inhabitants were kind, generous and hospitable; they knew how to 
commisserate, and were happy in relieving the sufferings of the soldier. 
While we on our part were grateful for their favors, which we endeavored 
to merit by treating them with the respect due to good citizens. Our 
time here passed very agreeably for two weeks, at the expiration of 
which we received orders to descend the Ohio River to Newport (Ken.). 

July 29th. The regiment embarked on board ten long keel boats, 
each boat being sufficiently large to contain one company of men. With 
our colors flying and drums beating, we left the shore in regular order 
and commenced our passage while the band, attached to the regiment, 
were chaunting our favorite ditty of Yankee Doodle amidst the cheers 
and acclamations of the generous citizens of Pittsburgh, assembled at 
the place of our embarkation. After passage of four days, without 
accident, we arrived at the little town of Marietta, where we had the 
pleasure of meeting with many of our hardy Yankee brethi-en from New 
England. We tarried here over night, and early next morning we con- 
tinued on our passage, and on the 8th of August we all safely arrived 
at Newport, a small village situated at the mouth of the Licking, which 
empties into the Ohio, and directly opposite the town of Cincinnati 
in the state of Ohio. Here we were to remain until further orders; 
while Lieutenant Hawkins was dispatched to Indiana to inform Gov- 
ernor Harrison of our arrival at Newport and to receive his command. 

The troops at this time were perfectly ignorant of their destina- 
tion, or the real object our government had in view, in sending us at 
such a distance to the westward. Many were still fearful that we were 
to be sent to New Orleans, and knowing the fate of former troops that 
had been stationed there who had been swept off by sickness, it created 
much uneasiness in the minds of New England troops, and some few 
desertions took place. We experienced some very warm, sultry weather, 
and considerable fear was entertained by Colonel Boyd for the health of 
the troops. Captain Welsh, an amiable officer, died and was buried with 
Masonic and Military honors. 

August 28th. Lieutenant Hawkins returned with orders from Gov- 
ernor Harrison for the regiment to proceed with all possible dispatch to 
Vincennes, in the Indiana Territory, where the conduct of the Indians 
on the Wabash had become very alarming. The Governor had previously 
been authorized to employ the 4th Regiment in his service, should cir- 
cumstances make it necessary. 



 

On the 31st Au^st we left Newport and proceeded down the Ohio, 
without difficulty, until we arrived at the falls or rapids, when we were 
obliged to disembark and have the baggage taken from the boats and 
conveyed round by land to the foot of the rapids, while skillful pilots 
navigated our boats through this difficult passage. 

Governor Harrison was at this place, and accompanied by Colonel 
Boyd, proceeded across the country to Vincennes, leaving the command 
of the regiment to Lieutenant Colonel Miller to continue their passage 
by water. 

September 4th. Early in the morning we left the rapids, and on 
the 9th, without any occurrence worthy of note,_ we arrived at the 
mouth of the Wabash, a distance of 1,022 miles from Pittsburgh; but 
the most disagreeable and difficult task in our navigation was yet to be 
performed. We had now 160 miles to ascend the Wabash, the current 
of which is very rapid, and at this season of the year was quite low and 
much interrupted by rocks and sand-bars. We were daily obliged to 
wade the river and haul the boats after us over the rapids, which 
occasioned many of our men, on our arrival at Vincennes, to be dis- 
ordered with that painful disease, the fever and ague. Every precau- 
tion possible was taken by the humane and generous Colonel Miller to 
presei-ve the health of the regiment; himself waded the river as well 
as every other officer; in many instances perfo lining the duties of the 
common soldier, and assisting them to haul up the boats. At the close 
of each day we brought the boats to a convenient landing; placed our 
guard for the night, while those who had obtained an evening's respite 
from the toils of this tedious and laborious passage, were suffered to 
regale their spirits over an extra glass of whiskey, bestowed by the 
liberality of our commander. The utmost hannony and good humor 
prevailed — no contention — no Murmuring — all cheerfully performed their 
duty. 

September 19, 1811. After a fatiguing passage of ten days through 
an unsettled country, which presented nothing to the view but a vsdld 
and dreai-y wilderness, our ears were cheered by a prospect of the town 
of Vincennes. It was dark before we landed and by the noise and con- 
fusion about us we concluded the town to be overrun with troops. A 
rabble soon gathered about the boats and assisted in hauling them ashore 
— their whooping and yells and their appearance caused us to doubt 
whether we had not actually landed among the savages themselves. Many 
of these militia spoke the French language; their dress was a short 
frock of deer-skin, a belt around their bodies, with a tomahawk and 
scalping knife attached to it, and were nearly as destitute of discipline 
as the savages themselves. The militia from Kentucky and a few com- 
panies of Indiana were decent soldiers, yet the large knife and hatchet 
which constituted a part of their equipment, vidth their dress, gave them 
rather a savage appearance. The hatchet, however, was found to be a 
very useful article on the march — they had no tents but with their 
hatchets would in a short time form them.«elves a shelter from the 
weather, on encamping at night. 

The Dragoons, commanded by Major Daviess, consisting of about 
120 men, were well mounted and handsomely equipped, and composed

of some of the most respectable citizens from Kentucky and Indiana. 

The Indians who had been lurking about the town for a number of 
days suddenly disappeared, and on the 

27th September. The army was embodied, consisting of between 10 
and 1200 men; and under the immediate command of Governor Harrison, 
we took up our line of march from Vincennes, being well furnished with 
arms, ammunition and provision, advancing with but little variation in 
the follovring

In this manner we proceeded on our march by the taps of the drums 
at the head of each column, to prevent the lines distancing each other 
too far. It was customary each morning, an hour before day-break, to 
rouse the troops from their slumbei-s, with three solitary taps of the 
drums of each line, when they turned out and formed in front of their 
tents, which was the line of battle in case of an attack; in this manner, 
they stood to their arms until the beating of the Reveille. This pre- 
caution was deemed a very necessary one, knowing it to be the time 
that the Indians generally choose to make their attacks, as the troops 
sleep more sound, and the sentinels become wearied and sleepy, and 
consequently less vigilant. 

October 3d. After a march of six days, through an uninhabited 
country, we arrived at a place on the banks of the Wabash, called 
Battelle des Illinois. Here we formed our encampment with the in- 
tention of tarrying a few weeks, to ascertain more correctly the dis- 
position of the Prophet and his warriors. A fort and Block Houses 
were ordered to be built at this place, which gave sufficient employ- 
ment to the militia. 

Some murmuring took place among them, being heartily sick of 
the camp, and desirous of returning to their homes. Many indeed, 
threatened to leave us at all hazards, which caused the Governor much 
anxiety and trouble. He appeared not disposed to detain any man 
against his inclination ; being endowed by nature with a heart as humane 
as brave; in his frequent addresses to the militia his eloquence was 
formed to persuade; appeals were made to reason as well as feeling — 
and never were they made in vain — when the militia unused to military 
restriction, threatened a desertion, his eloquence calmed their passions, 
and hushed their discontented murmurings — and in a short time all 
became tranquil, and unanimity reigned throughout the army. 

About this time many Indians came peaceably into camp, and held 
frequent Council with the Governor; but all endeavors to effect an 
accommodation with the Prophet were vain — they still continued stub- 
born and refractory — and would not listen to any terms of peace made 
them by the Governor. Their lurking Indians were nightly prowling 
about our encampment, and alarming the sentinels on their posts. On 
the 20th October in the evening, an Indian crept cautiously through the 
bushes, opposite one of the sentinels in the main guard and shot him 
through both thighs — the sentinel nearest to him, saw the flash of the 
rifle, and immediately presented his piece — snapped it twice — both times 
it missed fire! The Indian made his escape, the camp was alarmed, 
and the troops called to arms. The Dragoons were instantly formed, 
and under the command of that gallant and spirited officer. Major 
Daviess, sallied out and scoured the woods in the vicinity of the en- 
campment; but no Indians could be found. The Dragoons in passing 
the line of sentinels, were fired upon by mistake, the sentinels supposing 
them to be the enemy (it being very dark) but fortunately no one was 
injured. We stood to our arms the whole of this night, while the Gov. 
and Col. Boyd were riding down the lines animating the troops to do 
their duty in case we were attacked. 



 

Thus after a tedious course of negotiations, the fruitless endeavors 
to effect by fair means, a redress of our wrongs, and the patience of the 
Governor and of the army being nearly exhausted it was determined to 
give them some weightier reasons than had been heretofore offered, why 
peace should be concluded. Orders were therefore given for the army 
to be in readiness to march to the Prophet's town. 

October 21st. We commenced our march from Fort Han-ison, so 
called in honor of our worthy Commander; Col. Miller, the officer so 
highly esteemed by the troops of our regiment was unfortunately de- 
tained at this place by sickness. After a few days of tedious marching, 
and having crossed the Wabash, we arrived at Vermillion river — Capt. 
Baen, who had been long absent from the command of his company, 
had a day or two previous, joined us on the march, and being the oldest 
Captain in Commission, was appointed to act as Major and headed the 
left column of the army. Having a number of sick who were unable 
to proceed farther, a small blockhouse was erected for their accommoda- 
tion, and a Sergeant's guard was left for their protection. 

November 1st. We crossed the Vermillion river into the Indian 
possessions, at which time the weather became rainy and cold. Many 
Indians were discovered by our spies, lurking in the woods about us; 
supposed to be the scouts of the Prophet, watching our movements. After 
marching about fourteen miles, we crossed a small creek, and encamped 
on a high open piece of land; still rainy and cold. An alarm was here 
given by one of the sentinels, who fired on a Horse, which had strayed 
out of Camp. 

November 3d, continued on our march — came to an extensive level 
prairie, which took up the whole of this day in crossing — started up 
many deer, two of which we killed — also an animal called a prairie wolf. 
Nothing of importance transpired until — 

November 6th. When our spies, who had ventured near the Indian 
village, returned, and informed the Governor we were within a few miles 
of the Prophet's town — we were ordered to throw off our knapsacks, and 
be in preparation for an attack. We advanced about four miles to the 
edge of a piece of woods, when we were ordered to break off by com- 
panies, and advance in single lines; keeping a convenient distance from 
each other to enable us to form a line of battle, should necessity require 
it; — this was frequently done in the course of our advance toward the 
town, in consequence of the unevenness of the land, and the appearance 
of many favorable places for the enemy to attack us. In this manner we 
advanced very cautiously, until we came in sight of the Indian village, 
when we halted. The Indians appeared much surprised and terrified 
at our sudden appearance before their town; we perceived them run- 
ning in eveiy direction about the village, apparently in great confusion; 
their object however, was to regain in season their different positions 
behind a breast work of logs which encircled the town from the bank 
of the Wabash. A chief came out to the Governor, begging of him not 
to proceed to open hostilities; but to encamp \^'ith the troops for that 
night, and in the morning they solemnly promised to come into camp 
and hold a council, and they would agree to almost any tei-ms the 
Governor might propose; expressing their earnest desire for peace with- 



 

out bloodshed— but the treacherous villains merely made this promise 
to gain sufficient time to put their infernal scheme in execution. The 
Governor enquired of the chief where a situation suitable for encamping 
might be found; being informed, he dispatched three or four officers to 
examine the ground, who returned with a favorable report of the place 
— which was a piece of narrow rising ground, covered with heavy timber, 
running some length into a marshy prairie, and about three-quarters 
of a mile northwest of the town. Here we encamped for the night, as 
near the form of a hollow-square as the nature of the ground would 
admit. Being cool, cloudy weather, we built large fires in front of our 
tents, to dry our clothing, cook our provisions, etc. The signal for the 
field officers to collect at the Governors marque was given; we were 
soon after ordered to lay with our cartridge boxes on, and our guns at 
our sides — and in case of an attack (as was always the order, while on 
the march), each man stepped five paces in front of his tent, which 
formed the line of battle. 

On the morning of the 7th November, a few minutes before 4 o'clock, 
while we were enjoying the sleep so necessary to the repose of our 
wearied limbs — the attack commenced — when only a single gun was 
fired by the guard, and instantly we were aroused by the horried yells 
of the savages close upon our lines. 

The dreadful attack was received first by a company of regulars, 
under the command of Capt. Barton, and a company of militia, com- 
manded by Capt. Geiger, — their men had not the least notice of the 
approach of the Indians until they were aroused by a horrid yell and a 
discharge of rifles at the very door of their tents; considerable con- 
fusion ensued in these two companies before they could be formed in any 
regular order; but notwithstanding the disorder this sudden attack cre- 
ated, the men were not wanting in their duty — they sprang from their 
tents and discharged their pieces upon the enemy, with great execution, 
and kept their ground good until relief could be brought them. The 
attack soon extended round to the right line, where the troops were 
formed in complete order, and the assaults of the savages were returned 
in full measure. One company of Indiana militia fell back, in great 
disorder, but after some arduous exertions of their officers, they were 
again rallied and fought with a spirit that evinced a determination to 
escape the odium of cowardice. The battle had now become general, 
every musket and rifle contributed its share to the work of carnage. 
A few Indians had placed themselves in an advantageous situation on 
the left of the front line, and being screened from our fire by some large 
oak trees, did great execution in our ranks. The small company of U. S. 
Riflemen, commanded by Lieut. Hawkins, were stationed within two 
rods of these trees, and received the heaviest of their fire, but maintained 
the position in a most gallant manner, although the company of militia 
on their left were giving way in great disorder. Major Daviess, with a 
small detachment of dragoons attempted to dislodge them; but failed in 
the attempt, and was himself mortally wounded. Capt. Snelling, of 
the regulars, soon after made a desperate charge at the head of his 
company, with success, losing one man, who was tomahawked by a 
wounded Indian. The Indians fell back, and for a short time, con- 



 

tinued the action at a distance — here was some sharp shooting, as they 
had greatly the advantage, by the light afforded them from our fires, 
which could not be entirely extinguished. We were well supplied with 
buck shot cartridges, which were admirably calculated for an engage- 
ment of this nature. The savages were severely galled by the steady 
and well directed fire of the troops. When near day-break they made 
their last desperate effort to bieak our lines, when three cheers were 
given, and charge made by the 4th Regt. and a detachment of dragoons 
■ — they were completely routed and the whole put to a precipitate flight. 
They fled in all directions leaving us masters of the field which was 
strewn with the bodies of the killed and wounded. Some sharp-shooters 
of the militia, harrassed them greatly in their retreat, across the marshy 
prairie. The day was appropriated to the mournful duties of dressing 
the wounds of our unfortunate comrades, and burying the dead. To 
attempt a full and detailed account of this action, or portray to the 
imagination of the reader the horrors attendant on this sanguinary con- 
flict, far exceeds my power of description — the awful yell of the savages, 
seeming rather the shriek of despair, than the shouts of triumph — the 
tremendous roar of musquetry — the agonizing screams of the wounded 
and dying, added to the shouts of the victors, mingling in tumultuous 
uproar, formed a scene that can better be imagined than described. 

The following statements are from Sergeant Montgomery Orr, of 
Capt. Barton's Company, (one of the Companies first attacked) and that 
of William Brigham, a private of the late Captain Whitney's Company 
of Riflemen, who was on his post, in front of Barton's Company, at the 
time of the attack; the latter of whom was mortally wounded, and died 
of his wounds a few weeks afterwards at Vincennes. Their veracity is 
unquestionable, and as I had the recital from their own lips, I do not 
hesitate to declare my belief of them. 

Statement of Sergeant Orr. 
"About twenty minutes before the attack, I got up and went to the 
door of my tent (No. 1) and overheard the sentinels talking in front 
— listened, but could not distinctly hear what was said — it was rainy 
and very dark. I laid down and was partly asleep, when some person 
rushed by and touched the corner of the tent — I sprang partly up — all 
was still. I jogged Corpl. Thomas [David L. Thompson] (who slept in 
the same tent) and asked, "if he did not hear somebody run by the 
tent?" He said, "no — I've been asleep". I then laid down again, when 
something struck the top of the tent — Corpl. Thomas rose up, took his 
gun; in a moment thiee or four lifles were discharged at the very door 
of the tent, and an awful yell ensued — Thomas fell back on to me — I 
said, "Corpl. Thomas, for God's sake don't give back" — he made me no 
answer, for he was a dead man. I got out of the tent as soon as pos- 
sible — -the men were in confusion, some in front and some in the rear 
of the tents firing — the Indians within a rod of us. Capt. Barton ordered 
the men to form instantly they weie too much broken, and no regular 
line could be formed ; but they kept up a .steady fire on the Indians, 
who fell back. Capt. Geiger's company of militia, stationed near us, 
were in great confusion — they could hardly be distinguished from the 
Indians — I received a wound and was obliged to retire." 



 

Statement of William Biigham. 

"On the night of the battle, I was warned for Guard, and took post 
a little after sunset — Wm. Brown (a regular) was the sentinel on my 
left, and a militia man on my right. These three posts were directly in 
front of Capt. Barton's Company of U. S. Infantry. 

I examined the ground adjacent to my post very particularly. There 
"Was a small thicket of willows on a stream of water, about two rods in 
front of my post, and high grass between me and the willows — I observed 
it to be a favorable place for the approach of Indians and determined to 
be on the alert. Capt. Barton's Company were a few feet higher, and 
between us there were logs and some small bushes. I was relieved off 
post about 10 o'clock. At 3 o'clock I again took post; very dark and 
rainy. I had resumed my station about half an hour, when I heard a 
faint whistle, not far from Wm. Brown's post, as I supposed — he called 
to me; but I did not think it prudent to answer — however, after he had 
called several times, I answered "holloa" — says he, "look sharp"- — (the 
usual word of caution between sentinels) — I kneeled down with my gun 
on a charge. It was so very dark that no object could be discerned 
within three feet of me, and I could hear nothing except the rustling 
noise occasioned by the falling rain among the bushes. At this time, 
Brown, (being much alarmed) very imprudently left his post, and came 
towards me. I heard light footsteps — presented my gun, and should 
have fired upon him had he not that moment spoke, much agitated — 
"Brigham, let us fire and run in — you may depend on it there are In- 
dians in the bushes." I told him not to fire yet for fear we should give 
a false alarm. While we were standing together, something struck in 
the brush near us (I suppose an arrow) — we were both frightened and 
run in without fireing — the Indians close upon our heels — we passed 
swiftly by Cap. Barton's tents — I soon afterwards fell into Capt. Wilson's 
Company of militia, where I received a wound which broke my right 
arm." 

Had this attack been delayed but ten minutes longer, the troops 
would have been formed in line of battle, and in readiness to receive 
it. The General had arisen but a few minutes previous to its com- 
mencement, and in four minutes more would have ordered the usual 
signal (three taps of the drum) to be given for the troops to rise and 
stand to their arms. The orderly Musician at the same time stood in 
readiness for that purpose, awaiting the orders of the General. Some 
of the troops, were up, and sitting by the fires ; many of which had been 
furnished with fresh fuel, and the light arising from them, must have 
afforded the Indians a pretty correct view of our situation, and of the 
most proper place to make their assault. Every exertion was made to 
extinguish these fires the moment the attack commenced, which could not 
be but imperfectly accomplished as the Indian marksmen were sure to 
pick off whoever approached them. 

It was truly unfortunate that these fires were not extinguished the 
moment the troops retired to rest; for it is certain that the Indians de- 
rived a great advantage from their circumstance in the course of the 
action. 



 

The hasty charge made by Major Daviess to dislodge the Indians 
from behind the trees on the left of the front line, was made with only 
twenty of the dragoons, dismounted; and its fatal consequence to the 
Major, was in a great measure owing to his having on a white blanket 
surtout. He was easily disting:uished by the Indians, and received three 
balls in his body; he immediately fell, exclaiming, "I am a dead man;" 
he was taken up and lived, however, till the close of the action. The 
fall of this brave and amiable officer was greatly lamented by the army, 
as well as the citizens of the state of Kentucky, where he held the 
oflSce of Attorney General. He volunteered his services in the ex- 
pedition under Gen. Harrison, who, knowing his worth, appointed him 
to the command of the volunteer dragoons. 

Col. Owen, another brave officer, considerably advanced in years, 
and acting as aid-de-camp was shot from his horse by the side of the 
General and immediately expired. Judge Taylor, the other aid, had 
his horse shot under him; in their fall the horse came on top of the 
Judge, where he lay confined for some time, unable to extricate him- 
self; he was relieved from this disagreeable situation by a soldier, who 
happened to pass near him. 

Capt. Baen, who had been with us but a few days, was shockingly 
mangled with the tomahawk; — he was taken up in a delirious state, 
and died a short time afterwards. There was but one other instance of 
any person being tomahawked in this engagement; which was a private 
soldier of Capt. Snelling's company, upon a charge in the midst of the 
Indians. 

Gen. Harrison received a shot through the rim of his hat. In the 
heat of the action, his voice was frequently heard and easily dis- 
tinguished, giving his orders in the same calm, cool and collected man- 
ner with which we had been used to receive them on a drill or parade. 
The confidence of the troops in the General was unlimited, and his 
measures were well calculated to gain the particular esteem of the 4th 
Reg-t. All kinds of petty punishments, inflicted without authority for 
the most trifling errors of the private soldier, by the pompous sergeant, 
or the insignificant corporal, were at once prohibited. A prohibition of 
other grievances which had too long existed, in this regiment, at once 
fixed in the breast of every soldier, an affectionate and lasting regard for 
their general. The benefit of which was fully realized in the conduct 
of the troops in the engagement, as well as throughout the campaign. 

After the action, a soldier of the Kentucky militia, discovered an 
Indian at some distance above the encampment, leading a horse out 
of the woods, into some high grass in the prairie; he caught his rifle 
and made after him. The Indian had loaded his horse with two others 
wounded, and was returning, when the Kentuckian gave a whoop, dis- 
charged his rifle, brought the Indian down, and returned in triumph 
to the camp, leading in his horse. 

One Indian only broke through the lines into the encampment, and 
he was immediately afterwards dispatched by Capt. Adams, the pay- 
master of the regiment. 

The force of the enemy in the engagments could never be correctly 
ascertained; but from the best information that could be obtained, it 



 

was calculated to amount to between ten and twelve hundred warriors, 
headed by Winnemac, a Kickapoo Chief — and that they lost about four 
hundred in killed and wounded. Our loss amounted to forty-one killed, 
and one hundred forty-seven wounded. The names of those of the 4th 
regt. are given in the latter part of this Journal. 

A Potawatimie Chief was found severely wounded on the field, 
sometime after the action. He was brought before the General, and 
expressed the greatest sorrow at what had happened — and accused the 
Prophet of deceiving them. His wounds were dressed by the surgeon, 
and the best care taken of him while he remained with us on the 
ground. The Gen. left with him a speech to be delivered to the Indians, 
if they should return to the battle ground. 

November 8th. A small detachment of mounted men were ordered 
to advance to the Prophet's town, and see what had become of the In- 
dians. They entered the town and found an aged squaw only, who 
informed them that the Indians had left in great haste, immediately 
after the action, and had crossed the Wabash. It was a handsome little 
Indian village of between one and two hundred huts or cabins, and a 
large store house, containing about 3,000 bushels of corn and beans. 
In their hasty retreat they left many articles of value to themselves, 
which except a few were destroyed in the conflagration of the town. 

November 9th. After destroying considerable of our baggage, in 
order to make room in the waggons for the conveyance of the wounded 
we began our march on the return to Vincennes expecting the Indians 
would follow, and attack us. Such an event was greatly to be dreaded; 
as we were nearly out of provisions, and had upwards of a hundred and 
thirty wounded men to be attended to, who were painfully situated in 
the waggons, especially those who had broken limbs, by their continual 
jolting, on an unbeaten road through the wilderness. 

Having suffered severely in consequence of the light afforded the 
Indians from our fires in the late attack, we adopted another method 
on our return, by building large fires some distance beyond the line of 
sentinels, while those in the encampment were extinguished on our 
retiring to rest; which in case of an attack, would have been of much 
service by placing the enemy between us and the fires. The sentinels 
on post at night having been frequently alarmed by lurking Indians 
would place a stake in the ground about the height of a man, and hang 
their blanket and cap upon it, and retire a few paces, behind some log 
or tree; as it had become hazardous for sentinels to walk their posts 
■while the Indians were continually hovering about them. It was said 
that arrows had been found in some of the blankets put up in this 
manner, which is very probable, as they would approach within a few 
feet of a sentinel in the stillest night, without being discovered, as was 
the case at Fort Harrison, where a sentinel was shot down by an Indian, 
who had made his way through a thicket of bushes directly in front, 
and within twelve feet of the man on post. 

On the 14th we arrived at the small blockhouse on the Vermillion 
river, where we left our sick, who had looked with painful anxiety for 
our safe return. The vigilance of Sergeant Reed, who commanded at 
this place was highly applauded in the arrest of two militia men, who 

45—21182 



 

deserted us the moment the action commenced, and fled with such pre- 
cipitancy that they reached the blockliouse the night following, informing 
Sergeant Reed that the army was defeated, and nearly all were destroyed 
— advising him to leave the place and hasten back to Fort Harrison. 
Their advice was disregarded by the sergeant, who put them under 
arrest. The express on his way to Vincennes a few hours afterwards 
passed the blockhouse and informed them of the success of our engage- 
ment. 

We suffered much for the want of provisions during our march to 
this place. Many of the troops had made use of horse meat to satisfy 
their craving appetites for the last five days. Col. Miller, then at Fort 
Harrison, being apprized of our destitute situation, immediately dis- 
patched a boat with fresh provisions to our relief, which fortunately 
arrived at the blockhouse nearly at the same time with the army. 

November 15th. The wounded were placed in boats, and arrived at 
Fort Harrison on the morning of the ensuing day. Capt. Snelling with 
his company were left to garrison the Fort, and the army proceeded on 
their march. 

The author being one of the wounded, was put on board a boat with 
other disabled men and sent down the river to Vincennes. About 12 
o'clock at night the boat we were in struck on a sand bank ; which obliged 
us to lay by until the next morning. The night, as may be supposed, was 
passed in a very uncomfortable manner — the weather was freezing cold, 
and our wounds which had not been dressed for two days past, became 
stiff and extremely painful. 

November 19th. Arrived at Vincennes nearly at the same time the 
army did by land, and immediately after were placed in excellent quar- 
ters, and every possible attention paid to the sick and wounded, by Gov. 
Harrison and Col. Boyd, who always evinced the most anxious solicitude 
for the welfare of their soldiers. 

Nothing more was heard from the Indians until the latter part of 
December when a Kickapoo Chief, bearing a white flag, with a few 
others, who were desirous of concluding a peace with the United States, 
came to Vincennes with the intention of holding a council for that pur- 
pose. The Governor informed them that he did not consider them as 
qualified for making a treaty which would be binding on their leader the 
Prophet ; and therefore no treaty would be made unless the Prophet 
was present at the council, with his principal chiefs. 

They informed the Governor that the warriors of the Prophet had 
all left him; reproaching him with being the instigator of all their mis- 
fortunes, and threatened to put him to death. They were impressed with 
a belief that they could defeat us with ease; and intended to have at- 
tacked us in our camp at Fort Harrison, had we remained there a week 
longer. 

The Potawatimie chief who was taken prisoner by us and left on 
the battle ground, they said, had since died of his wounds; but that he 
faithfully delievered the speech of the Governor, to the different tribes, 
and urged them to abandon the Prophet, and agree to the terms offered 
them by the Governor. 



 

March 10, 1812. We experienced some heavy shocks of an Earth- 
quake about this time, which occasioned considerable alarm; but did no 
other damage than throwing down a few chimnies in the town. On the 
Mississippi the shocks were more severe, where considerable damage was 
done, especially to buildings. It is said the motion of the earth in that 
quarter was from six to eight inches to and fro; but at Vincennes, 250 
miles to the north, it did not exceed three inches in the heaviest shocks, 
as was ascertained with a lead ball suspended by a thread from the 
ceiling in the house. The duration of the longest shock was about three 
minutes — they continued at intervals throughout the month. 

March 29th. About 150 Indians who were said to have remained 
neutral in the late contest, came to Vincennes, and encamped about two 
miles north of the town. They were requested to deliver up their arms, 
and a guard of soldiers should be placed over them for their protection, 
and tents supplied them while they tarried with us; this they complied 
with and desired an audience of the Governor on the ensuing day, which 
was granted. 

In Council, they declared their destestation of the Prophet and his 
adherents, expressing their wishes to remain in peace and friendship 
with their father, the President of the United States. The Governor, 
in a short reply, warned them against entering into any alliance with 
the Prophet and his warriors — telling them, if he should again be dis- 
turbed and obliged to come among them, it would be out of his power 
to restrain his young warriors from destroying them all. A treaty was 
signed, and the Indians received their annual presents of blankets, broad- 
cloths, calicoes, etc., and left the town for their encampment. 

April 2d. The Indians again came in, habited in their new dresses, 
performing their dances through the town, to the great diversion of the 
regiment, who were unacquainted with their peculiarities, except their 
propensity to deception and treachery; the ill consequences of which we 
had been taught at the battle of Tippecanoe. Towards evening they re- 
tired in good order, and soon after received their arms, and returned to 
their villages up the Wabash. 

There were still remaining many refractory Indians on the Wabash, 
who would agree to no terms of peace with the United States. They 
had even opened the graves of our unfortunate comrades who fell in 
the late action — stripped and scalped them, and left their bodies above 
ground. Col. Miller was preparing to send a detachment of troops to 
the battle ground to have them again interred ; but some friendly Indians 
undertook this office and the bodies were again replaced. 

April 4th. Information was received of the murder of a family of 
seven persons on White river, and others in Indiana, besides many 
depredations on the Mississippi. The settlers were alarmed, and fled to 
the forts and the most populous towns for protection, leaving their prop- 
erty to the mercy of the savages. 

April 9th. A family on the Embaras river, only seven miles from 
Vincennes, consisting of a man, his wife and three small children, were 
massacred while in the act of leaving their home for the purpose of 
finding protection at Vincennes. A young man who had resided with the 
family escaped and fled to Vincennes, where he arrived about 12 o'clock 



 

at night, and gave the alarm; the troops were immediately called to 
arms, expecting an attack upon the town. The next day Col. Miller, 
with a small detachment from the regiment, proceeded to the river 
Embaras, where they found the bodies of the murdered family, shock- 
ingly cut up with the tomahawk and scalping knife. The man had his 
breast opened, his entrails torn out and strewn about the ground. They 
were all scalped except an infant child in the mother's arms, which 
was knocked on the head. The bodies were decently interred and the 
party returned to Vincennes without being able to discover the per- 
petrators of this horrid massacre. 

We received information soon after the above transaction that the 
famous Chief, Tecumseh, brother to the Prophet, had collected a con- 
siderable force on the Wabash with the intention of attacking the town 
of Vincennes, saying to the Governor, "You have destroyed my town in 
my absence; I shall, when the corn is two inches high destroy yours 
before your face." Tecumseh was not an enemy to be despised; and 
the information of his approach towards Vincennes created considerable 
alarm among the inhabitants. The town was filled vrith families who 
came to avoid the fury of the savages. Many of the principal dwelling 
houses were piqueted in, and the militia were called upon to be at their 
posts at a moment's warning; thus were we kept in fearful apprehension 
of an attack being made upon us by the Indians, whenever we should 
retire to rest; add to this the frequent shocks of earthquakes and the 
reader may imagine the unhappy situation in which we were placed. 

A serious misunderstanding had for some time existed between 
Gov. Harrison and Col. Boyd, the grounds of which, the author could 
never correctly ascertain ; yet was supposed to originate from some hasty 
remark of Col. Boyd upon the conduct of the militia of Indiana, during 
the campaign; and perhaps he had laid claim to a greater share of the 
laurels won in the late engagment, than the people of Indiana were 
willing to allow him; however, it is admitted by all, that the bravery 
good order and discipline of 4th Regiment secured to the army the 
victory at Tippecanoe for this Col. Boyd deserves the highest praise. 

April 12th. Col. Boyd left Vincennes for the city of Washington, 
and Col. Miller assumed the command of the regiment, when we soon 
after received orders from the Government to march to Dayton, in the 
state of Ohio, there to join the army under Brigadier Gen. Hull. The 
citizens of Vincennes sincerely lamented our departure, as there would 
be but a small force left for their protection against the savages, who 
had now assumed a formidable aspect, and threatened destruction to the 
place. Capt. Snelling, and his company arrived from Fort Harrison, 
where they had been stationed during the winter. 

May 3d. We swung our knapsacks and commenced our march for 
the falls of the Ohio. The road was so very bad that we were obliged to 
keep pioneers in advance to clear it, which greatly retarded our march. 
We observed on our route through Indiana, several houses piquetted in, 
where a number of families had collected, and formed little garrisons, to 
defend themselves against the Indians, who daily committed the most 
flagrant depredations upon the defenseless emigrant; we frequently saw 



 

men armed going to their fields to work, leaving their women and chil- 
dren to garrison their dwellings until their retuiTi in the evening. 

May 11th. We arrived on the banks of the Ohio, and immediately 
crossed the river to Louisville, Ky., where great respect was manifested 
towards us. Many of the citizens of this place had fought by our sides 
at the battle of Tippecanoe.

Taylor to Dawson 

Cincinnati, July 15, 1823 

Dawson, Harrison, 226 

Sir, 

Your [Mr. Dawson's] letter, which you handed to me last 
evening, containing certain queries relative to the affairs on 
the Wabash, in November, 1811, I have perused, and will 
proceed to give you concise answers to each of them, without 
going much into detail, which my recollection at this late 
period will not admit of. 

To your first question, I answer, that I was aid-de-camp to 
Governor Harrison, with the rank, pay, and emoluments of a 
major, upon the expedition on the Wabash in 1811. 

To your second, I state positively, that the Indians did not 
dictate to the Governor the position to encamp the army the 
night before the battle of Tippecanoe. When the army 
reached the Indian town in the afternoon, perhaps about sun- 
set, the Governor ordered major [Marston G.] Clark and my- 
self to proceed to the left, and endeavor to find a suitable 
place for an encampment ; we did so, and discovered the place 
upon which the battle was fought the next morning; upon 
our return to the army, we reported to the Governor our 
opinion about the place, which we stated to be favorable for 
an encampment. 

He had, at the time he despatched major Clark and myself 
upon this service, sent captain William Piatt, who was the 
chief of the quartermaster department, above the town to look 
for a suitable situation for an encampment; his report was 
unfavorable, and the Governor determined to occupy the 
ground selected by Clark and myself. 



 

To your third querie, I answer, that both major Clark and 
myself considered the ground upon which the army encamped 
to be favorable, and I believe the same opinion was enter- 
tained by every officer in the army. 

To your fourth, I answer, that the plan of preparing the 
troops to be ready upon the march or in camp, to engage the 
enemy, appeared to me to be judicious; and fifth, I under- 
stood it to be the plan of general Wayne, adopted by Governor 
Harrison, with an improvement by the latter in marching 
in single files by columns, instead of double files, as prac- 
ticed by general Wayne; of this, however, I can speak with 
no degi^ee of certainty. 

To your sixth, I answer, that the changes in the position 
of the troops during the action were made by the Governor 
himself, or by his orders, as far as my observation extended, 
or I have understood from others. 

To your seventh, I recollect only one instance in which I 
was ordered to conduct any of the changes of position, and 
that was in a detachment commanded under captain [David] 
Robb, from the right flank to the relief of [Spier] Spencer's 
on the left. 

To your eighth, I answer, that Governor Harrison on the 
march, was active, vigilant, and prudent; in the action, he 
appeared to be firm, cool, and collected, and upon the return 
of the army to Vincennes, he did every thing in his power 
for the comfort of the wounded, and to be prepared to repel 
an attack, should one be made by the Indians. 

To your ninth, I answer, that no officer was killed or 
wounded upon either of Governor Harrison's horses, he hav- 
ing two. 

To your tenth, I answer, that I understood and believe (for 
I was not present) that major [Joseph H.] Daviess was 
killed in charging the enemy with a few dismounted dragoons ; 
others can give more correct information upon this subject 
than I can, and to those I refer you. 

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant.

Thomas Scott to Dawson 

ViNCENNES, July 25, 1823 
Dawson, Harrison, 227 

Moses Dawson, Esq. 

Sir, 

You request my opinion of General William Henry Har- 
rison, as a citizen, a soldier, and a general. 

I have had the pleasure of an acquaintance, intimately, 
for many years, with General Harrison, and ever considered 
him a man of honor, one who sought to do justice, and who 
was always willing to assist and benefit the condition of those 
with whom he was acquainted and associated ; and know him 
to be the friend of the oppressed and injured. Hospitality 
without ostentation was always to be found within his doors, 
and his household was ever ready to extend charity to the 
sick and needy. 

As a soldier and an officer, I can speak from an acquaint- 
ance formed with him as such, that I shall ever be proud of. 
I served under him in the campaign of 1811 upon the Wabash, 
as a captain, and shared with him the danger in the action 
of Tippecanoe, in the night of the 7th November, 1811; no 
one on the march, or on the return, did I hear murmur a com- 
plaint of the General's conduct; he possessed the confidence, 
and was the pride of the army ; his absence even for one day 
was felt by the army. 

I have thought, and still think, that few generals would 
have faced danger at so many points as General Harrison did 
in the action of Tippecanoe. Wherever the action was warm- 
est, was General Harrison to be found, and heard encourag- 
ing, and cheering the officers and soldiers. His humanity, 
his attention, and his care to the wounded, after the action, 
from the battle ground to the hospital in Vincennes, was that 
of a benevolent christian, and was evidence of the goodness 
of his heart. 

I cannot but say, that I consider General Harrison's con- 
duct on the campaign, and in the action of Tippecanoe un- 
exceptionable, as a soldier and officer of the United States, 
when correctly informed, who was a friend to the late war,

an enemy to Indian warfare, and who returned from the army 
with clean garments. 
I am, sir, yours, etc. 

Thomas Scott> 

Larrabee to Dawson 

Cincinnati, Ohio, 13th October 1823 

Dawson, Harrison, 228 

Sir, 

I have a desire to place in a true light, (as far as I am able) 
several circumstances attending Tippecanoe battle, which have 
gone abroad to the people in a wrong view, and from which 
they have drawn erroneous impressions towards the conduct 
of the commanding General. 

1st. It is understood that the encampment occupied at 
Tippecanoe, was made choice of by the General from a report 
of the Indians in favor of it. 

Three officers, well able to judge, went out in search of a 
place, and they reported the one taken up. The situation was 
such, that if the army had been called upon to make choice of 
a place to fight Indians, I venture to say nine-tenths would 
have made that their selection. There was but one encamp- 
ment during the whole campaign, to which a preference could 
be given, and this was a cluster of trees, surrounded by 
prairie, while the one at Tippecanoe had only three sides 
prairie, the other being woods. 

2d. The impression prevails, generally, that the army were 
surprised in the attack. 

At the time the army left Vincennes, they were formed in 
the order of battle against the attack of Indians, and were 
never out of this situation till they returned; each one occu- 
pied the ground he would defend himself upon, whether 
marching or at rest upon it. This all-daring idea was in- 
stilled into the army collectively and individually by the Gen- 
eral, from the time we entered the wilderness, till a trial was 
had of the effect. The army was trained to be prepared to re- 
ceive that attack, and nothing but the unremitted attention of 
General Harrison to enforce the necessary discipline, could 
have brought the troops to such a state of perfection and order 
as the result of the battle proved. The fact of the army ris-

he was appointed Lieut. Col. and July 9, 1813 made colonel. 



 

ing from rest, and being ready to receive the Indians in two 
minutes (of which there ought not to be a doubt) after the 
report of the first fire, is sufficient to satisfy all persons ca- 
pable of judging, as well as all unprejudiced minds, that it 
was not a surprise; the officers and soldiers slept with their 
clothes and accoutrements on, with drawn swords, muskets 
loaded, and bayonets fixed, laying by the sides of those who 
were to use them in a night attack. In this situation, on the 
morning of the 7th November, 1811, about fifteen minutes 
before the usual time of rising, the Indians attacked us by 
firing upon the guard three hundred paces from the lines; 
they then rushed upon the camp. The troops, although at rest 
at this moment, were in line and ready to receive them as they 
came up. An army marching against Indians in their coun- 
try, (the wilderness) is differently situated than when going 
against civilized enemies. The sending out scouts and spies, 
cannot be done with the most distant prospect of their return- 
ing. The army is thus compelled to keep compact, and their 
authority or knowledge of the Indians, extended no further 
than the ground they occupy ; the first that is known of them is 
the report of their fire. — Such attacks from a civilized force 
would be considered as a surprise, while by Indians it cannot, 
except the army is unprepared for them. At the battle of 
general Wayne, the Indians got the first fire ; at the battle of 
Brownstown the Indians got the first fire, and they got no 
further advantage at Tippecanoe. These battles and their re- 
sults were similar, except the Indians engaged more desper- 
ately in the later. If the army had been surprised, according 
to the general understanding upon such attacks, I may con- 
clude by saying not one would have ever returned to tell the 
tale. The mistake which is prevalent amongst the people, in 
regard to this attack, is not attributable to the General or to 
the army, but to themselves; and the cause is very obvious 
they rarely being qualified to judge of the circumstances. The 
General has been condemned for not attacking the Indians 
on the 6th; when he marched up in front of their town, his 
orders were to act on the defensive. This is enough to satisfy 
common sense, and it v^'ould be useless to multiply words with 
a view to appease stubborn prejudice upon this point. 
I am, respectfully, sir, 

your obedient servant 

C. Larrabee

Gentlemen 

I observe Extracts from many of the administration papers 
in which the often Refuted slander of the Indians Selecting 
the Encampment for gen Harrison the evening previous to the 
Battle of Tippecanoe is repeated with as much Boldness as if 
it never had been proven a falsehood and as the statement will 
be published in all parts of the United States many Honest 
persons of all parties will believe it to be the fact if not con- 
tradicted. It has occured to me that my perfect knowledge of 
the whole transaction which has given rise to the slander Ren- 
ders it not more than an act of Strict Justice to gen Harrison 
to state candidly and impartially the facts of the case and leave 
the public to Draw their own Conclusions, which should you 
think of Sufficient Importance to occupy a small space in your 
Paper I have to request of you to Publish the same. 

I am gentlemen your &c. 

Wm. Polke 

ps. for my Character I Refer you to the entire Indiana Dele- 
gation both in the Senate & H R 

W. P. 

In the Campaign of 1811 under the Command of governor 
Wm. H. Harrison the Command of a Small Company of Spies 
and guides was Entrusted to Cap T. Dubois one of the oldest 
and most Respectable of the french Citizens of Vincnnes well 
acquainted with the Indian Character and customs and per- 
fectly acquainted with the Indian Country. Capt. Dubois not 
being an English Scholar at his Request I acted as his Clerk 
in making out his reports to the Commander in Chief which 
kept me constantly in his company and Near his person on the 
march and at all times while engaged in his Highly Respon- 
sible and Confidential duties which enables me to speak with 
the more certainty. On the Morning of the 6th of November 
the Day preceding the memorable Battle of Tippecanoe soon 
after the army was put in motion we discovered that the In- 
dian Spies were watching our movements the fact was com- 
municated to gen Harrison who directed Capt. Dubois to en- 
deavor to Bring the Indians to a parley as his Instructions was 



 

to make them propositions of peace and not to attack them in 
accordance with these Instructions in Company with Capt 
Dubois and the Interpretters we advanced a few hundred 
yards in front of our small Company but all attempts to bring 
them to a parley were unavailing they gradually Retiring as 
we approached them between 10 and 11 o'clock A M we ap- 
proached Burnets Creek on which was a small wet prairie 
Difficult to Cross and where Capt Dubois was of opinion if 
attacked at all that would be the place of attack Harrison put 
his army in order of Battle and directed the Spies & guides not 
to pass untill the army was near enough to support us. On 
passing the defile above named about 11 o'clock A. M. the army 
was halted and formed in order of Battle and Capt. Dubois 
directed to go on to the town (about two miles) with the gens 
proposals for a parley but to Run no Risks should there be 
an appearance of Danger on Capt Duboises advancing with a 
single Interpretter the Indian in his front on the truce Retired 
while Indians were discovered on his flanks evidently with the 
Intention of falling in his Rear and preventing his Return on 
Returning and Communicating the fact to the gen the army 
was again put in motion and the Spies and guides with the 
Interpretters were directed to march a few hundred yards in 
front and if possible to Bring them to a parley the army had 
proceeded but a short distance before several Indians halted 
untill we came up and expressed their willingness to have a 
friendly talk as they termed it with genl in a few minutes 
gen Harrison advanced with the advanced guard and the 
Spkesman who I was Informed was the White Horse a prin- 
cipal man among them agreed to have a conference the next 
morning and Expressed a wish that the army Should then 
Encamp on gen Harrison Replying to him that was no place 
for the army to Encamp the Indian pointing to a Rise not far 
off on arriving there the gen told the Interpretter to Inform 
him that was no place for an army to encamp there being no 
water near the gen then Inquired of Capt Dubois if he knew 
whether there v/as a good Situation for an Encampment above 
the town on the River who Replyed he thought there was the 
gen then directed Cap Park of the Dragoons (the late la- 
mented Judge Parke of Indiana) to take twenty five of his 
men and accompany Capt Dubois and also the Quarter master 
Cap Piatt but directed us not to approach so near the town 
as to interfere with the Indians on arriving above the town 



 

the Situation was not approved of and Majors Taylor & Clark 
having been Dispatched in another Direction reported favour- 
able and on that ground the army Encamped and on the Next 
morning was atchieved the Victory of Tippecanoe I have since 
frequently examined the ground and believe a Better selec- 
tion could not have been made and I must be permitted to say 
I have had some experience in Indian warfare having in Early 
life been taken Captive by the Indians near the conclusion of 
our Revolutionary war from Kentucky and acted as one of 
the Major Prices Battalion of Spies in the memorable Battle 
of gen Wayne on the 20th August 1794 when both gen Har- 
rison & Major Price were noticed with approbation by that 
Distinguished Commander I mention that not by way of a 
Boast but only to vindicate the character of our Beloved Com- 
mander at Tippecanoe.

The British still retained armed possession of the posts on our 
frontier in violation of the treaty of 1783, when, Gen. Anthony Wayne 
succeeded Gen. St. Clair in the Command of the Army of the Northwest. 

Gen. Wayne passed the winter of 1793, 4 at Fort Washington;' and 
in the spring having his force nearly doubled by the accession of 1,100 
Kentucky mounted volunteer riflemen, proceeded north in pursuit of the 
savages. The enemy made a stand in August on the river Maumee, and 
met a signal defeat under the guns of the British Fort situated at the 
rapids" of that river. 

The treaties of Greenville with the Indians and of Jay in 1795 with 
Great Britian gave repose to the West — Jays treaty expired in 1805, 
and the first order in Council directed against neutral commerce was 
promulgated in the spring of 1806; in this last named year, Tecumseh' 
began his efforts to array the Northern and Southern Indians against 
the whites of the United States, but no hostilities occurred except in the

Magazine of History Vol IX, 95 and Vol. X. 83. Mrs. Fannie Scott Rumely of La Porte 
has kindly furnished the editor a collection of Judge Polke's papers and it is hoped 
something more may be done to preserve the biography of this worthy pioneer. 

1. Fort Washington was located within the limits of the present city of Cincinnati. 

2. Near the site of Maumee City — The Indians were apparently confident of their 
British allies arresting our force at this fort for which they retreated but were refused 
pi-otection, that a few miles only from the Battle field they had encamped their squaws, 
children, and property, a fact not then known to Gen. Wayne at the time of the en- 
gagement. 

3. There were two Tecumsehs— the prophet, who it was supposed instigated the 
attack on Harrison's force at Tippecanoe — and Tecumseh the warrior, a Brigadier gen- 
eral in the British army, killed at the battle of the Moravian Towns in 1813. 



 

campaign of 1811, until the attack on William Collins settlement at the 
Pigeon Roost, seventeen miles from Louisville, Ky., in July, 1812. 

The restlessness of the savages produced no doubt by the efforts of 
the Tecumseh engaged the attention of our Government, and William H. 
Harrison, then Governor of the North Western Territory, and subse- 
quently the President of the United States, was directed with a sufficient 
force, to penetrate if necessary to the Prophet's town, on the Wabash, 
and require of the Indians, adherence to and fulfillment of existing 
treaties. This expedition resulted in the battle of Tippecanoe. 

Our fellow citizen Major Peter Funk now aged 79 years is probably 
the only surviving officer of that campaign, then, as now he occupied his 
large and fertile farm eight miles from Louisville, and with good health, 
he still preserves a vivid recollection of the men and occurance of that 
marked event in our history. The following narrative is compiled from 
his dictation: 

In August 1811 Captain Funk was in command of a com- 
pany of militia of Cavalry. Adjutant Adams of the 4th U. 
S. Infantry waited on him and invited him to an interview 
with Gov. Harrison who was then at Louisville. Capt. Funk 
immediately sought the governor who informed him that he 
desired to increase the force then assembling at Vincennes by 
one company, of Cavalry, and one of Infantry and that he had 
been advised that, he, Capt. Funk could raise the Cavalry, and 
Capt. James Hunter^ the infantry. Capt. Funk assured him 
of his willingness to do so and desiring to have the sanction 
of the Governor of Kentucky, was furnished by Gov. Harrison 
with letters to the Executive. In such hot haste as to kill the 
fine horse on which he started, Capt. Funk presented himself 
to Gov. Scott (himself an old Indian fighter) who gave his 
immediate assent and urged the Captain to prompt action. 

Before leaving Lousiville Governor Harrison came to the 
conclusion that Funks cavalry would be a sufficient reinforce- 
ment, and therefore dispensed with the services of Capt. 
Hunter — he ordered Capt. Funk to report to Col. Bartholo- 
mew. 

In a few days the Captain raised his company and early in 
September joined Col. Bartholomew's regiment, then march- 
ing on Vincennes. 

Vincennes was the rendezvous of Governor Harrisons 
forces ; there Jo. Davis who had at one time held the commis- 
sion of Col. of Militia in Kentucky came up with the expedition 
with two volunteers James Mead and Ben Sanders who had 

Croshan at the defense of 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 719 

accompanied him from Lexington, the Col.'s then place of 
residence, and four young gentlemen from Louisville who were 
waiting there for company." The cavalry of the expedition 
consisted of Captains Baggs, Funks and Parks companies, to 
the command of this arm Col. Jo Daviess was appointed much 
to the dissatisfaction of the officers and men who being volun- 
teers, considered that they should have been consulted in the 
choice of their immediate superior officers. 

After a few days delay, the little army passed up the Wa- 
bash river to Terre Haute, the desig-n being, there to build 
a fort, but the banks of the river proving too high, a point 
four miles higher up was selected, where in 29 days was con- 
structed Fort Harrison. 

At Fort Harrison and subsequently on its route toward the 
prophet's town, the expedition was frequently visited by par- 
ties of Indians who committed no depredations and asserted 
that all difficulties and misunderstandings would be overcome 
by their chiefs. 

The troops having become sickly, the 4th Regiment suffer- 
ing the most, Gov. Harrison before leaving the Fort having 
been informed that the Indians were more numerous in his 
front than he had previously been led to expect, sent Davis 
Floyd and Geoi'ge R. C. Floyd to Kentucky to apply for a re- 
inforcement of 500 men. Consequent upon this application 
made by the two envoys to Brigadier General Samuel Wells, 
he ordered out his brigade and beat up for volunteers. The 
privates hanging back. General Wells and several of his of- 
ficers stepped out and being joined by some of the file, the 
volunteer force was swelled to 32 men, and it, electing Col. 
Frederic Geiger as their Captain proceeded to join the expedi- 
tion. 

It should be stated that Gen. Wells having called out his 
brigade without first obtaining the sanction of the Executive, 
which would have instantly been granted on application, the 
soldiers had scruples as to the propriety of volunteering that 
the Executive authority was not applyed for may have arrisen 
from the fact that Frankfort, the residence of Gov. Scott is 
250 miles from Fort Harrison, that at the time of the de- 
parture of the envoys thence Gov. Harrison expected in a few

days, to move onward, to the goal then distant less than 100 
miles, and that the probability was, that before the force re- 
quired could be at Fort Harrison the object of the campaign 
would be accomplished, and leave no laurels to be gathered by 
the reinforcing party. 

At Fort Harrison the expedition crossed the Wabash and 
shortly after was joined by Captain Geigers company. At 
the mouth of Vermillion river, two days were occupied in 
building a block house, and there were left the water craft, 
and surplus baggage, under a guard — proceeding up the Wa- 
bash on the 6th of November about 3 P. M. the force was 
within 200 yards of the Prophet's town, and was there met 
by several indians who assured Gov. Harrison that on the 
morrow a meeting would be arranged and all difficulties ad- 
justed satisfactorily to his government, and they begged that 
the troops would be restrained from entering the town and 
frightening their women and children by occupying their 
town. Our spies" reported an eligible camping ground a mile 
distant, and the expedition was directed to it. It is a tongue 
of land jutting into the prarie (then a swamp) in the form 
of a sad iron, elevated some 8 feet on the two sides above the 
lowland and being about 200 yards across the upland at the 
base of the triangle. 

It appeared that the indians had been impressed with the 
idea that the army had cannon, but on the 6th the negro driver 
of Gen. Harrison's cart mixed among them and informed them 
that no big guns accompanied the expedition. For this treach- 
ery, the negro was by a court martial forthwith convicted and 
condemned to be shot, provided an attack from the indians 
should ensue — The sentence however was not carried into 
effect — It is supposed that had the expedition been provided 
with Cannon, the indians would have been deterred from as- 
saulting our force. 

It should be bourn in mind that Gen. Harrisons instructions 
were to insist upon the fulfilment of treaty stipulations and to 
avoid hostilities. 

The expedition having occupied the ground selected by their 
spies, threw up a breast work across the end of the encamp- 
ment where it was continued from the upland and the troops 
being shown their places of parade in case of attack, and

ordered to show no white about their dress with sentinels 
doubled, slept upon their arms. 

Capt. Funk was arroused two hours before day on the 7th 
by the yells of the Indians, and the ringing of their fire arms ; 
the morning was dark, and drizzly, nothing could be seen but 
the flashes of the enemies guns. He immediately mounted 
his troop which had been stationed near Gov. Harrisons mar- 
quee, the occupant of which he repeatedly saw or rather heard 
during the conflict — finding that the enemies missils reached 
some of his men while they were unable to annoy their foe 
he ordered them to dismount and, with sabre and pistol in 
hand, to stand beside thier horses, ready to repel any attack, 
that should force the lines of infantry in their front. Thus 
stationed they ceased to offer objects for the Indians aim as 
the shoulder of the bluft' on which the encampment was lo- 
cated afforded protection to those who obstained from show- 
ing occupying its margin or elevating themselves on horse 
back. 

The ground occupied by the Indians was in the swamp at 
the two lower sides of the triangle heretofore described, and 
as a consequence, their missils could do but little harm ex- 
cept to such, as in most cases needlessely exposed themselves 
near or on the verge of the plateau, but on the left of the 
encampment, left as you stood with your back to the breast 
work on the upland there was some down timber on the verge 
of the plateau, which the Indians having occupied, a galling 
fire was kept up by them on our encampment. Col. Daviess 
who some time previously had selected twenty of the best 
mounted and equipped men from the Cavalry, which selec- 
tion the governor upon remonstrance from the mounted 
troops, had refused to dissalow, after the fireing had con- 
tinued about % of an hour, came to the Gov. and in the hear- 
ing of Capt. Funk asked "Will you permit me to dislodge 
those d — d — savages behind those logs", — The Governor re- 
plied denying his request — again in the hearing of Capt. 
Funk he applyed to the Governor and met a similar response. 
Subsequently (as he informed Capt. F. after the engagment) 
he obtained the Gov.'s permission. On foot, wearing a white 
Capot, he lead his 20 picked men (also on foot) toward the 
Indians masked by the down timbers; when within 30 or 40 
yards of his object he fell, shot between the right hip and 
ribs. From the position he must have occupied, the down 



 

timbers on his left his men somewhat to the right, it is fairly 
inferable that the shot proceeded from our ranks ; the attack 
failed, and the Colonel was bourn to his tent. 

Daybreak on the 7th of November in rain, come a little 
after six o'clock. As the day dawned the infantry in squads 
charged upon the savages and Funk's and Bagg's companies 
outstripping the foot men drove the Indians into the swamps 
as far as practicable for horsemen to follow; this was the 
end of the action. 

Great consternation prevailed in the little band, who had 
thus gallantly repulsed this treacherous night attack, for 10 
days it had been reduced to half rations, their few cattle had 
stampeded during the engagement while they expected from 
rummors that had obtained currancy, that the Indians would 
return to the attack, reinforced by Tecumseh the warrior at 
the head of 1000 Indians. 

About 8i/o oclock Capt. Funk w^aited on Col. Daviess and 
assisted in changing his clothes and dressing his wound. The 
colonel was in great pain and consternation fearing the ex- 
pedition would retreat abandoning its baggage and wounded 
& he exacted from the Capt. the assurance that in no event 
would he leave him behind. The Col. a distinguished lawyer 
who had joined in the campaign from a love of adventure, 
expired at 1 P. M. the same day. 

Although our troops were satisfied that they inflicted severe 
punishment upon their savage foe, They were aware that if 
Tecumseh should reinforce them, their situation would be 
eminently critical. 

The day of the 7th was devoted to the care of the wounded 
to whom all the provisions in the camp were assigned, the 
burial of our dead, and the strengthening of the encampment. 
Night found every man mounting guard, without food, fire 
or light, and in a drizzling rain. The Indian dogs during the 
dark hours produced frequent alarms by prowling in search 
of carrion about the sentinels. The 8th dawned fair, the spies 
for the first time ventured from the encampment, and visiting 
the prophets towTi found it abandoned by the Indians with 
the exception of a wounded warrior and an old squaw. Great 
was the joy in camp when they returned bearing strings of 
corn as it was evident from the Indians abondoning their 
store of food they had retreated precipitately, after being 
well whipped. The wagons and mounted men then proceeded 



HARRISON : MESSAGES AND LETTERS 723 

to the town and after charging themselves with all the copper 
& brass kettles they could find, and all the beans and corn they 
could carry, the remaining property & town was destroyed. 
On this same day leaving the warrior and squaw at the en- 
campment with abundant store of beans & corn, the expedi- 
tion, having 22 wagons of wounded retraced its steps arriving 
at the Block house, on the Vermillion on the third day the 
troops having dra\v^l no rations since the engagement. Pro- 
ceeding thence to Fort Harrison & Vincennes & Louisville 
the Capt.'s Company was mustered out of service at the lat- 
ter place. 

The Captain says that the ground selected at Tippecanoe 
was eminently adapted for the encampment of the expedi- 
tion. That Col. Davis's horse was a roan purchased of Frank 
Moore of Louisville, that Col. Owens was shot from the back 
of his own white horse & that Gen. Harrison's white horse 
was ridden against his order by Mr. [Waller] Taylor, his aid. 
The Captain, also says that the design of Gov. Harrison was 
that in case of attack his trooi)s should not leave the stations 
assigned them so long as they could not see — had his orders 
been followed in this regard many lives would have been 
spared, as the break of the plateau sheltered our men, and 
enabled them by lying do^\^^ to return the Indians fire without 
being exposed.^
