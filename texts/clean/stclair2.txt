 CAPTAIN JOHN DOUGHTY TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR 
 
 FORT MclNTOSH list October 1785   The latter is a trader who lives at the Tawa towns He is warmly recommended to me by Colonel Harmar as a friend to the country   He appears to be an intelligent man and well acquainted with Indian affairs  This and Detroit which the English ceded to us us well as the lands This must then convince you that you have not been told the truth 1The only nation that participated in the treaty at the Orcat Miami was the Shnwanese and that nation afterward repudiated the terms      I am so informed by several persons who have been among them      For account by Leith see Appendix 632   
 
 11 COLONEL HARMAH TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR PHILADELPHIA October 22 1785      That Girly and Caldwell were lately at the Delaware and Wyandol towns persuading the Indians not to go to the treaty at the Big Miami that 11 Tawa chief told him that his father meaning the  British had advised him not to go  He is positive in his opinion from his frequent  intercourse with the Indians that it will be very dangerous for the surveyors to go on with their business until the present uneasiness subsides  He supposes they would soon have had a shot at each other had not the other Indian come up who knew him  He met three families going to Detroit from the Mingo  Bottom they were going to settle under the ISritish government 1 On the 29th June 1785 Congress directed a treaty to be negotiated with thu Shawanese and other western Indians        I have given him orders to expedite his march as he would be on time to go down the river with Captain Doughty and to put himself under his command          13 to your permission repaired to tins place in order to expedite the recruiting service 
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT PITT July 3d 1786     Such is the intelligence given by Mr. Bull These Moravian  Indians among whom Bull resides by what I can learn have ever been friendly to the United States The circumstance therefore    An Indian war seemed to be imminent     
 
 COLONEL HAUMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT PITT July 12 1786  Notwithstanding the intruders having been so frequently removed from the public lands Captain Doughty informs me there are  several who have crossed the river again and some have ventured to penetrate the country as far as twenty miles from the Ohio     It is generally supposed they will not attend Near a month will elapse before he will receive an answer He is under very just apprehensions for his safety and has applied to me for an escort  The emissaries who are stimulated by the British  officers or their agents will be industrious to urge the Indians to open  hostilities it will be your duty to counteract them and I shall flatter myself that you will be effectually able to accomplish it 1 Thomas Hutchins Geographer-General who had been appointed by  Congress to make the surveys in the West He was born at Monmouth N. J. in 1730 He was Assistant Engineer in Boquet 's expedition    He was a contributor to the Philadelphia Transcript lie died at Pitt burgh April 28 1789.—Am Biog Die       As this would be a serious movement I beg your orders upon this head  before I undertake it The murders that have been committed lately upon the  inhabitants passing up and down the Ohio indicate great dissatisfaction prevailing amongst the Indians    Indeed from every intelligence which I have been able to collect matters do not wear that favorable aspect which has been represented    I shall give the officer commanding particular orders not to form nny offensive operations into the Indian country without my permission Establishing posts high up the Miami and Muskingum I nm persuaded you will agree ought to be deferred for the present ns I am making my  arrangements to be ready to cover the surveyors ns much as shall be in my power    
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WVR FORT HARMAR AT THE MOUTH OF THE MUSKINGUM August 10 1786   lie would have three hundred troops left for active field operations  The Indians had returned well satisfied with their treatment and he had sent a speech to the Delaware Nation by an Indian named Turis       He has returned    PHILIP LIEBERT FOKT II MJMAR July 20 1786       As I have received no order from you upon this head I have given express orders to Captain Finney not to form any offensive operations into the Indian country without my directions      Many have promised to come In Pokongekalas 's town I met the Big Cat a very great warrior and George Washington they in particular were very glad to see me They promised to protect me whilst I staid amongst them for the whole town was drunk  They said they were going to hold council in the Shawanese town  They were painted black and told the Shawanese they would set the example and were going to war   This information was confirmed to me by three Frenchmen besides Rollins When I was at the Shawanee town where Elliot resides I found that he had frequent councils with them and that the Shawanese in general were not well disposed to the Americans  The chiefs in every instance shook hands with me and were glad to see me    
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY or WAR FORT HARMAR October l0f/i 1786     
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR   I have then-fore directed Captain Finuey to make his arrangements accordingly      19 Finney I do myself the honor to inclose to you and hope my conduct in this affair may meet your approbation An expedition under Colonel Logan with nine hundred militia went forward on the 1st ultimo    I am sorry that this disgraceful affair should have happened as Melanthy had  always been represented as a friend to the United States  I very much fear that the expedition will prove unsuccessful    The troops escorting him are barefoot and miserably off for clothing particularly woolen overalls  
 
 I pray you to order the new clothing  forwarded here as soon as possible 1 COLONEL H YRMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT HARMAR May 14th 1787  He writes me from Pittsburgh that every preparation was made and he should ascend the Alleghany on the 27th ult  1 HS    I spent a week with Major Wyllys at the garrison            Very irregular proceedings have been carried on in that country      21 inhabitants have suffered greatly his party having impressed their cattle and distressed them very much    Amongst other irregularities committed the following is another instance A boat came from Xew Orleans to the Post to trade   The seizure was made as Spanish property and designed as a retaliation      There is no better place to rab=e them than in Kentucky  I am convinced that such a corps would be highly useful   I went over the river and made a speech to their chief called the Wolf  their nations  I shall expect official intelligence from the War Office respecting the surveying department for this year  By the last accounts the Indians had stolen his horses As these horses are all insured they will be a dear bargain for the public   
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT HARMAR June 7 1787    The surveyors have made application to me for escorts to complete the fifth sixth and seventh ranges I have detached an officer and 1This contained instructions for the summer   23 sixteen men to Wheeling for that purpose which is the greatest number I could possibly spare them They are very extravagant ill their demands The whole regiment would scarcely suffice them    I propose to leave written instructions for Major Doughty upon his arrival to take command in this quarter    
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR CAMP AT THE RAPIDS OF THE Onio June 15f/i 1787  We arrived on the llth   Ascending tbe Wabash and driving the cattle will be attended with s me  difficulty  marching by land from hence directly to the Post Upon a  caleulation it would require seventy pack-horses which could not be hired under half a dollar each per day   The commissioner 's goods are here    
 
 COLONEL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  S r     The location was m ado on the Miami    I propose to march by land from this carrying place to Post Vincennea the distance I am well informed is no more than fifty miles The  cattle and eighteen horses will be drove along     Having  considerable credit in the Kentucky country he succeeded accordingly and has drawn bill on the contractors for the flour he furnished  These men will be extremely useful  To this man I have promised something extra Tl»e other three are good woodmen and will serve as expresses to carry dispatches to and from the posts to the Rapids  I trust that this will meet with your approbation as it is done upon an economical principle and will certainly be a saving to the public        until I receive your sanction for so doing  Their business is to have a trade with the Americans These and the Choctaws huvc been treated with and are very friendly with the United States    Be pleased to order your letters directed to his charge 
 
 BRIGADIER-GENERAL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OP WAR POST VINCENNES August 7th 1787      27 ascend the river for Post Vincennes   On the I6th we forded the White River a considerable stream about   On the 18th we were visited by Colonel Le Gras the magistrates and the principal French inhabitants welcoming us upon our arrival Their behavior was most respectfully submissive  Post Vinceunes is a very considerable village situated upon the Wabash about one hundred and twenty miles from the mouth It contains near four hundred houses—log and bark—out-houses barns etc     I expected his arrival every day          These Indians were well pleased they presented me with a calumet I gave them some small presents and they set off on the 31st to  deliver my message to the different chiefs       To these points I shall lend my attention  29 gaily obtained and those that have teen encroached upon without sufficient anthority  Such American inhabitants as have settled under the French charter are also framing a petition to Congress praving for relief and they will be recommended by the French  Both parties will appoint Mr. Bartholomew Tardivean as their agent    It will deter several people from Kentucky and other parts from taking up the public lands A door was opened very fast for intrusions from that quarter  Be pleased to receive the following inclosures viz 1         
 
  FORT HARMAR November 24th 1787   Our march was very fatiguing as the weather was excessively warm and water very bad and scarce on our route  These prairies are very  extensive natural meadows covered with long grass One in  particular which we crossed was eight leagues in breadth       31 etc       They are  almost extinct at present not exceeding forty or fi/ty total   The situation is low and unhealthy and subject to inundation  Their number is one hundred and ninety-one old and young men   On the l th we passed through St  La Belle Fontaine is a small stockade inhabited altogether by Americans who have seated themselves there without authority     Their number was two hundred and thirty-nine old men and young I was received with the greatest hospitality by the inhabitants There was a decent submission and respect in their behavior Cahokia is  distant from Kaskaskia twenty-two French leagues which is about fifty miles   After dinner we returned to Cahokia St. Louis nicknamed Pancour is much the handsomest and geutcelest village 1 have seen oil the Mississippi It is about four miles distant from Cahokia and rive leagues above it the river Missouri unites with the Mississippi  About twenty regular Spanish troops are stationed here On the 22d I left Cahokia to return to Kaskaskia       This evening I returned to Kaskaskia  NVe crossed the Mississippi accordingly were politely entertained and after  dinner returned to Kaskaskia   About eight or ten Spanish troops arc stationed there  I have to remark that all these people are entirely unacquainted with what Americans call liberty Trial by jury etc. they are strangers to    We inarched by a lower route  I made the distance by the lower route to be about one hundred and seventy miles  Every precantion was taken We had a fortified camp two redoubts were thrown up on our right and left and the guard in front intrenched The troops were all new clothed and made a truly military appearance The Indians saluted us by firing several  volleys on the Wabash opposite our camp   On the 7th I invited them to camp and made the inclosed speech to them The Indians admired the troops I believe they had never seen such a sight before    Mr. Coudro has acted as volunteer for a considerable time in the regiment and has conducted himself with propriety If a vacancy should happen in the  Connecticut quota I beg leave to recommend him to your notice On the 9th the young warriors were drinking whisky and dancing before our tents all the morning to demonstrate their joy On the 10th I made them several presents from the commissioner 's goods to no great amount  They returned highly satisfied with the treatment they received   est attention to them   Their  interpreter is a half Frenchman and married to a Wcca squaw He has very great influence among them I judged it necessary to pay extraordinary attention to him   Accordingly Major Hamtramck commands there       At the former we got a brass six-pounder with several swivels at the latter from Mr. Dal ton two brass three-pounders I thought it best that the public propertv should be under our own charge We inarched along what is called Clarke 's Trace and arrived on the 7th October at theKapidsof the Ohio I was mistaken in a former letter concerning the distance it is about one hundred and thirty miles  From the Falls to the Post the country is in general hilly and good wheat land Major Wyllys with the fleet arrived at Clarkesville on the 21st    On the 13th November we arrived at this post  Captain Zeigler arrived here with the fleet on the 21st We were  favored with remarkably flue weather ever since we set out from the Post   The water being so exceedingly low detained Lieutenant Beatty a long time at Fort Pitt He did not arrive at this garrison until the 20th instant at night Wo are all happy to find that he has obtained such a just and honorable settlement for the regiment and we are much indebted to you for having been pleased to lend him every assistance in the business     You are pleased to ask me intelligence respecting the military lands

  FORT HARMAR January 10 1788 Extract     From all accounts the Muskingum River inclines more to the eastward than is laid down in Captain  Hutehins 's map If so the tract reserved for the late armv will be very valuable   1 MS   39 This information I received from Mr. Tardivean The  commercial situation as you justly observe is line indeed It is a great misfortune that it is so subject to inundation I beg leave to  refer you to Mr. Tardivean for more particular intelligence upon this subject    Such an enterprise would certainly be a disgrace to the United States         The men have nearly forty days whisky due them As goon as the weather will permit I shall send Major Wyllys the necessary orders respecting Sullivan and his adherents   I bcir leave to observe that Fort Mclntosh is by no means  tenable The small party stationed there I propose to order to Fort Pitt in order to receive stores etc 1 GOVERNOR Sy 
 
 CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR PHILADELPHIA January 27 1788        Files State Department  41 general war will ensue     Should the business come to a favorable issue they can easily be brought up and distributed If it does not come to a favorable issue they are in safety        A general Indian war while it would involve thousands in the most extreme distress would be attended with such an expense as our present situation would render highly unadvisable

 BRIGADIER-GENERAL HARMAR TO SECRETARY OF WAR FORT PITT April 26 1788 Sir —I am now upon my tour to Venango and shall ascend the Alleghany to-morrow in order to visit Captain Heart 's post   I do not think that full faith and credit is to be given to his intelligence  His orders were not to exceed the 25th May in returning He had also permission to proceed to Post Vincennes  1In a letter ilated Juno    
 
 GENERAL HARMAR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR Extract FORT HARMAR June 15 1788    His garrison was found to be in excellent order  Major Doughty now proceeds in the barge and will have the honor to receive the Governor and accompany him down    General Clarke who had himself traveled through the country pronounced it excellent    The emigration is almost incredible   ably  The Senecas in particular place great  confidence in him he is a great favorite among them  The distance by water I suppose to be about one hundred and sixty miles by land about eighty

 GENERAL BUTLER TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR PITTSBURGH July 1 1788  47 the inclosed from the messengers since which I have seen some Indians from the upper Sandusky and other places   Mr. Duncan has gone to the ground I am told the Pipe and his people arc gone from their town to him   There have been some alarming accounts brought in by Girty and some other persons who were present but their report is positively  contradicted by two Seneca men who left the Sandusky since they did   
 
         
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO SECRETARY OF WAR PITTSBURGH Jnbj 5 1788  I suspect indeed that the concession has a little embarrassed them      This indicated long delays                
 
 I GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT HARMAR July 13 1788      Nine Delawares with their women and children came to the party about two hours after the attack         In a few days the whole will be here  If they mean to be at peace with the United States they will at least make an apology for what has happened   The messenger will probably draw forth a  reply that may produce another from me perhaps another from them again and some time will be gained     
 
 GENERAL BUTLEU TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR PITTSBURGH July 14th 1788      Be that as it will this you may depend upon I will use every endeavor to forward it while I remain here   I have this day got Guiosota and the Big-tree or Stiff-knee to set off for Muskingum to assist the Pipe who I hear is there to protect Mr. Duncan and the people at that place  
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO GENERAL BUTLER FORT HARMAR July 15th 1788        Brant was endeavoring to form an Indian confederacy to resist the  Americans  53 dian to tbe Wyandot towns with a speech for the nations  assembled either at the Tawa or at Detroit River and another to the  Wyandots requesting them to forward that for the assembled nations  Lest any accident should have  befallen the man I have sent out I wish you would find an  opportunity to send another copy  I was therefore obliged to act upon my own ideas  It will strike you perhaps as an impropriety that the message is in my name only as commissioner to treat with the Indians  I dare say the affair at the falls has been much exaggerated in common report and I fear it will occasion great uneasiness in the settlements   GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR 'S ADDRESS AT MARIETTA               55 laws as may be thought proper for you    But with all the care and attention to your interest and happiness that can be taken you have many difficulties to struggle with               
 
 57 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT HARMAR July 16th 1788                    These are my opinions   Khun seems well disposed and I have reason to think that tribe is generally so The Half-King who is now dead was the greatest enemv we had amongst them

 GENERAL BUTLER TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR PITTSBURGH July 18th 1788              
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGES PARSONS AND VARNUM FORT HARMAR July 18tli 1788 Gentlemen —I have looked over the proposed law for  establishing the militia and I have some objections to it in its present form which I shall take the liberty to detail        mutual statisfaction   Richard Butler 2 From this It would appear that not only were the Five Nations to attend the treaty but Brant fully expected to be present himself     The majors are naturally his aids as the adjutants are theirs and his also It  appears also to be unnecessary to declare that a brigade shall be  commanded by a brigadier I have no power to appoint such an  officer   I do not exactly conceive what is meant by the declaration that the senior class shall act separately from the junior      All moneys that may accrue from fines might be applied to forming a fund to provide a small magazine I submit these observations with great deference gentlemen   
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR FORT HARMAR July 22d 1788    They are now here six in number and in close confinement  When questioned about it they prevaricated   There is no further intelligence from the Indian country    
 
 BRIGADIER-GENERAL HARMAR TO SECRETARY OF WAR Extract FORT HARMAR July 23d 1788 The great treaty will be deferred for some time      The Governor has sent a spirited message to the different nations who are assembled and counseling at the Tawa or Omi River  demanding satisfaction for the gross insult offered to the United States 
 
  FORT HARMAR July 29th. 1788 Gentlemen —I have attentively perused the law2 relating to estates held in common which you have been pleased to present me but I have not been able to discover any benefit that would result to 1 MS  The Indians were active and murderous         It is true the business to be transacted at proprietors meetings is required to be specified but there is no express restriction that they should meddle with nothing else I imagine the proprietors met would think themselves justified under the general words to act upon any thing else that had respect to the common property                67 the original articles to have any validity  They have power to adopt laws only   
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CL AIR TO JUDGES PARSONS AND VARNUM FORT HARMAR July S0tft 1788       But you will pardon me gentlemen for mentioning one more      One thing more in the law I have been considering    I have taken the liberty to send you the Pennsylvania volume that you may examine the laws referred to above if you should think proper at your leisure You will find them in the folios 30 to 33 and 70 to 73 
 
 JUDGES PARSONS AND VARNUM TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR MARIETTA 31st July 1788     And how far the particulars suggested respecting a probate lavv should have influence         powers should have been than what they are   It was made pro bono publico and therefore ought to be liberally expounded     And if this be granted surely the diction ought to be rendered uniform        If this construction be not  admitted we feel ourselves involved in difficulties that may prove  insurmountable For a time we must confine our legal operations to the principles of the Constitution and the common law only   71 State Necessity may in law contemplation excuse an act which otherwise would be unlawful  Then the maxim might apply Necessitas non kabet ligem       Neither do we conceive that the matter can be varied by Congress by a new ordinance or by a declaratory act        can with your Excellency surmount the present embarrassment  
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JUDGES PARSONS AND VARNUM FORT HARMAR Augmt 1 1788  
 
  FORT HARMAR August 7 1788   I can not find how this explanation applies      In forming laws on general subjects it may be difficult to  connect all the particulars that may have relation to those geueral  subjects  Forming and transcribing laws I take to be two very different things  There is another circumstance besides which influences me not a little It was hinted at only and distantly it may now be proper to mention it expressly      temporary government as well as to all laws formed by the General Assembly after it shall have been organized    Permit me to suggest one in the present   The assent iif the Governor to laws formed by the Assembly is made unequivocally necessary The reasons arc at least equally strong why it should be necessary to those adopted by the judges      75 by the Ties connections and subordinations that are said to exist in colonial governments and to which laws must be applied   It is unsafe ground and ought not to be traveled upon I presume not to say what the powers ought to have been             I assure you my difficulties are not affected     But these have nothing to do with your character as legislators As judges you are clothed with a common-law jurisdiction which is at once both descriptive and restrictive—restrictive as to my powers in equity You are also legislators in a limited degree   If by these limitations the legal operations are confined to too narrow bounds I see no hope but in soliciting an alteration in the Ordinance   I think so still nor so far as it respects myself shall I be satisfied with being merely excused   No  excuses should be admitted for men in public trust I shall offer none              Ho was also sustained by Congress   July 27 17SS

 FORT HARMAR COUNTY OP WASHINGTON Kept Id 1788     not generally and I still hope that matters may be settled in an amieable manner      I doubt not it will be at Detroit by the time the Indians leave it   I have written to the printer to know whence he had it However obtained it was great imprudence to publish it   78 79 80  87 But the detention I have met with has prevented any attention being paid to the settlement on the Wabash and Mississippi where I believe it is very much wanted So soon as the treaty closes I shall proceed to those countries but the season is so far advanced already that it appears probable our residence for the winter must be taken up here

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR 
 
   They say the Six Nations arc desirous to be at peace with the United States  It is altogether improbable that they could have had any directions on the subject  to have no more solieitatiou on that head  Yesterday two persons arrived from the messengers  From these it appears that the  Wyandots are well disposed themselves  The other nations will be here but it will yet be three weeks or a month before they  arrive    On these I make no commeut It is also somewhat extraordinary that the British should take this opportunity again to make presents to the Indians after having so recently made them the most  considerable that ever were given at one time  Their members arrived at Detroit are stated to me at two hundred and seventy-five and  another embarkation from Niagara expected   But sir it is very little protection they will be able to afford    A war with them will probably involve some others and it will soon become general     With savages it is impossible

 BRIGADIER-GENERAL HARMAR TO MAJOR HAMTRAMCK FORT HARMAR October 13 1788 Dear Major You will act promptly in seizing and confining the Gross Tete or any other villans who were accessorv to the murder committed at Sullivan 's Station  The intelligence has been transmitted to the War Office    Let your fort be named Fort Kuox 
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO GENERAL KNOX FORT HARMAR October 20 1788      On being asked what they meant by Brant talking differently from what had been expected they said he had been exciting all the nations to a war with the Americans and they were dissatisfied with him for that reason  The words were Be strong and have patience you seem as if you were ready to come and speak to us here but be strong and sit still for in a few days you shall hear from us    Indians ostensibly is and at a season when fresh supplies can not be thrown in from Canada   On the 10th I dispatched the Indian who calls  himself George Washington  It is to be observed that the reports about Brant brought by the Indian messengers are not much to be depended on they were the Cornstalk 's people and sent out by him and between these two there is a mortal and open rivalship and enmity   The thing is certain though we have not the particulars    I propose to stay here about a week longer if no accounts arrive within that time we may  certainly give the matter up and expect hostilities   95 agined than prevented   
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OP WAR FORT HARMAR Xowmber 4th 1788 Sir —A day or two ago I wrote you a hasty letter to inform you that the Indian messenger Washington had returned and brought letters from Wilson which gave me reason to expect the Indians would soon be here  They are now  inclosed Wilson 's letter is marked No 1 that from Brant to him No 2 and No      In a letter to P. Langan he said I have still my doubt whether wo will all join or not some being no ways inclined for  peaceable methods    Ill a few days we shall have better information perhaps when I shall have the honor to make the communication  Washington mentions this circumstance further in that speech viz that if they would not immediately go and meet the American commissioners at the Muskingum they should not receive from them the British so much as a breech-clout

 FORT WASHINGTON February 20 1790      I have  written to the War Office that I wished very much to have your  Excellency 's opinion upon this subject before I ordered the officer to  proceed I must therefore beg that you will be pleased to give it It seems very much depends on the too adventurous establishment   Mrs. Harmar desires to be remembered most  affectionately to you and Major Sargent 
 
 MAJOR DOUGHTY TO MAJOR WYLLYS ANCE DE LA GRAISE 2~ th March 1790   We fought them four hours and then escaped in this distressed situation  My wounded men were in so distressed a situation as to require immediate assistance The only resource left me was to come to this place where I have met with every civility I could wish from Mons Fouehet the commanding officer You know what must be my feelings  For God 's sake send immediately   The result is seen

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR  CAHOKIA May 1 1790 A      By that letter you will perceive that every thing seems to be referred to the Miamies which does not promise a peaceable issue   The recalling the Minister when that business was in train always appeared to me as a very hasty and  inconsiderate step   137 to be here in another world that has no connection with the one we lately left He ascribes the depredations all to the Miamies       They pretended to be sorry for what they had done when they found them to be Frenchmen and let them go after exchanging with them their old fusees for their rifles Their numbers were reported by the prisoners to •amount to eighty but it is not probable they were so numerous  tach a part to the Ohio for provisions immediately on my arrival and to make another detachment to the Ance de la Graise lo bring up Major Doughty            It is a point on which some people are feelingly alive all over and all their jealousy awake       But I will take another opportunity to give you my  sentiments on that subject more at large which you may compare with Major Doughty 's who is a pretty adequate judge   You may perhaps wonder that I should send for the Kickapoos to this place when I  expect the other nations at Fort Knox    The nation is very inconsiderable and I do not think it necessary to trouble you with them at present He himself is the greatest beggar I have met with among nations who are all beggars He counts no little upon his having been with the American troops in Virginia and so far he merits some countenance In the country below the Kaskaskia there are a great many Piankeshaws not over friendly though they make great professions   They had three killed and wounded and are very heartily  frightened   The Ottowas and Saes are gone to war against them       Of what is passing in your quarter or in the European world we know as little as the man in the moon For pity sake send some newspapers

lands held by the people and to run the lines that had been directed by Congress to embrace the donations    The Illinois country as well as that upon the Wabash has been involved in great distress ever since it fell under the American dominion    To this succeeded three successive and extraordinary inundations from the Mississippi which either swept away their crops or prevented their being planted   The paper No 5 contains the orders for a compensation to the surveyor and No       It is most probable that such power was never delegated to the courts by Mr. Todd at least it does not appear    Their case seems to be a hard one    No 7 is a representation from them upon this subject  about a league distant from it On the way Mr. Baird had been directed to uiukc the surveys there as well us at the latter place              The river however  affords a safe and convenient harbor for boats                 The difficulty arose from these circumstances            The donations to the ancient settlers have not been laid out  becanse at Kiiskaskia and Prairie du Rocher no person could be found to do it         May I be  permitted to suggest that a law declaring those possessions escheated  unless the former owners return and occupy them within a certain time would not be an improper measure           What is brought by the British  traders the Spanish subjects purchase and pav for on the American side taking all the risk that attends the introducing them into their own o country upon themselves       Could those also be subjected to it a decided advantage would be given to the American trader    It would certainly be for the national honor that an establishment that would command that communication was made but the great distance and the difficulties that might attend the supporting it will probably prevent it at present          But the circumstance that slaves can not be introduced will prevent many people from returning who earnestly wish to return both from a dislike to the Spanish Government and that the country itself is much less  desirable than on the American side Could they be allowed to bring them back with them all those who retired from

miles A scout sent out yesterday fell in with an Indian camp got some plunder and seven horses branded United States supposed to have been stolen from Fort Washington We had a light snow all this day 3d.—Marched at nine o clock The first four miles very flat and wet     The high dry ground barely  sufficient to encamp the army lines rather contracted Parallel with the front line runs the creek about twenty yards wide  Militia advanced across the creek about three hundred yards     The guards had reported the Indians to lie skulking about in c  nsiderable numbers   259 telligent officer and party to make discoveries    The poor militia who were but three hundreds yards in front had scarcely time to return a shot—they fled into our camp The troops were under arms in an instant and a smart fire from the front line met the enemy   The artillery and musketry made a tremendous noise but did little  execution   Was at this time with the General engaged toward the fight he was on foot and led the party himself that drove the enemy and regained our ground on the left The battalions in the rear charged several times and forced the savages from their shelter but they always turned with the battalions and fired upon them back indeed they seemed not to fear any thing we could do  They were  visible only when raised by a charge The ground was literally  covered with the dead The wounded were taken to the center where it was thought most safe and where a great many who had quit their posts unhurt had crowded together  It appeared as if the officers had been singled out a very great proportion fell or were wounded and obliged to retire from the lines early in the action       The only hope left was that  perhaps the savages would be so taken up with the camp as not to  follow  It was past nine o clock when repeated orders were given to charge toward the road The action had continued between two and three hours   The stoutest and most active now took the lead and those who were foremost in breaking the enemy 's line were soon left behind  The enemy soon discovered the movement and pursued though not more than four or five miles and but few so far they turned to share the spoil    I got Lieutenants Sedam and Morgan with half a dozen stout men to fill up the road and to move slowly I halted myself until the General came up   The wounded who came off left their arms in the field and one-half of the others threw theirs away on the retreat The road for miles was covered with tirelocks cartridge-boxes and regimentals How fortunate that the pursuit was discontinued a single Indian might have followed with safety upon either flank      He had made some arrangements and as we arrived in the evening found him preparing again to meet us Stragglers continued to come in for hours after we reached the fort  A convoy was known to be upon the road and within a day 's march The General determined to move with the First regiment and all the levies able to march      Marched again just before day the General soon after rode on to the fort Troops reached in the afternoon  ply for the wounded etc    Besides not any one department was sufficiently prepared both quartermaster and contractors extremely deficient  It is a truth I had hopes that the noise and show which the army made on their march might possibly deter the enemy from attempting a serious and general attack It was unfortunate that both the general officers were and had been disabled by sickness in such situation it is possible that some essential matters might be overlooked

 FORT WASHINGTON 9tfi November 1791        This was executed with great spirit   At this moment they had entered our camp by the left flank having pursued back the troops that were posted there      The camp and the  artillery were abandoned but that was unavoidable for not a horse was left alive to have drawn them off had it otherwise been  practicable   The rout continued quite to Fort  Jefferson twenty-nine miles which was reached a little after sun-setting The action began about half an hour before sunrise and the retreat was attempted at half an hour after nine o clock                       267 tion 
 
  
 
 FORT WASHINGTON November 12 1791 Sir —I request the favor that you will make known to the militia the great regret I feel for the loss they sustained in their lute  gallant commander Lieutenant-Colonel Oldham and other brave  officers and soldiers   The latter was so anxious to curry favor with General Knox that he made the charge  publicly that Captain Slough did not receive his orders from General Butler and that he did not report to him as represented The result was that he was tried before a court-martial and dismissed the army for falsehood and insubordination       There is also in the First regiment a Mr. Elliott who should have some claim to promotion I believe he served in that capacity all the last war   which informs me that Kentucky is all in motion that fifteen hundred men would assemble at Craig 's Mills on the 15th and  proceed to this place

 FORT WASHINGTON November 24 1791   A very few—twenty-five—came forward and finding that the rest would not immediately follow them have returned as I fear they all will    The detachment returned from Fort Jefferson on the 22d The convoy got in safe and met with no opposition Only two or three Indians were seen by them    water and the snow had fallen there to a considerable depth but was gone off again The wounded officers are mostly returned except Captain Gibson and Captain Darke  The cold and fatigue during the march has so much inflamed his wound that he is not able to return and added to that his feet are frost bitten His Colonel Darke 's stay at that place is peculiarly embarrassinp as he had put Major Hnmtramck in arrest the morning he left this place       Major Ba ntramck was honorably acquitted  271 The levies arc now all discharged except the Maryland battalion and Fanlkner 's corps They were to have been mustered this day as the previous step but the excessive rain that is now falling will prevent it  I had them hanled out from the bank and the quartermaster has not been able to get them in repair  Bread and tea arc my sustenance nevertheless I am recovering     I have also just now received letters from Pest Vincennes

 ANSWER OF JUDGES SYMMES AND TURNER TO THE GOVERNOR 'S SPEECH DELIVERED IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE CAPACITY  Permit us to congratulate you sir upon seeing you again among us            Sec I  And again Sec II   But it may fairly be presumed their weight would be inconsiderable   365 the members assembled unanimity now becomes indispensable       We grant the impropriety   What does the Constitution say  Words we  presume can not be stronger let the punctuation be what it will      We remember too that the best consideration we could then give the Ordinance inclined us to believe that the powers either to adopt or make laws were optional as to the legislators               367 the Executive   We are persuaded your Excellency 's ideas will in the end meet ours in this respect   JOHN CLEVES SYMMES G. TURNER OBSERVATIONS ON EXTENDING THE JURISDICTION OF A SINGLE MAGISTRATE IN THE TRIAL OF SMALL CAUSES BY GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR IN THE LEGISLATURE                Is it not certain that the decisions will often be contradictory  369 morrow and a third in a manner different from both     The consequences would follow for the reasons I have already assigned to wit that the proceedings are summary and the execution prompt           While credit can be easily obtained debts will be  contracted and sometimes by persons who know not at the time hov they are to discharge them  The effect then must be by increasing credit to multiply lawsuits There is yet another evil which attends the summary jurisdiction

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO WILLIAM ST. CLAIR CINCINNATI June 3d 1795 Dear Sir —An accidental opportunity offering to your country I can not let it pass without dropping you a line My last by Mr. McKeuzie I hope you have received  I can not yet tell you  however when that will happen           Is he an inhabitant If he is or if he is not he ought to send forward his complaint    What happened at it as respects yourself need give you no trouble as the prosecution against you was evidently malicious and evidently caleulated to justify his other proceedings against you     If it is adopted Judge Symmes will be in the county this summer and hold the court as it ought to be held    
 
 GENERAL WAYNE TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR   I had the honor to inclose you on the 2d inst           Your own good judgment and experience will best dictate to you the most proper means to effect this desirable business and in which I will most cheerfully co-operate as far as may be necessary and consistent The measures I had heretofore taken would most certainly have prevented the savages from injuring the inhabitants or committing depredations were it not for the nefarious conduct already mentioned 
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO GENERAL WAYNE CINCINNATI June HtJi 1795   The instances you point to in the letter you honored me with on the 5th inst     If I can get any evidence whereon to proceed an inquiry shall be made into it  although it is probable that thjs party were really the aggressors in the affair      All that can be done is to punish them after the act if they can be apprehended    A man too has since been killed at Muskingum WM

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO OLIVER WOLCOTT ESQ SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY No Date 1795                                  It is the same with respect to the act for collecting a duty on distilled spirits   It will  perhaps prove no more than that people do not always think correctly or alike with regard to the same subject  But it is not a principle to depend upon It is otherwise with the last in question when not even in a virtual extension could that be depended on can be pretended        The second stage was that when having gained a certain population for it it was  supposed the people might be trusted to legislate for themselves but the government is to remain        383 held out which every individual in the United States was free to accept or reject at his pleasure         
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO OLIVER WoLcorr 1 CINCINNATI July 24 1795    Your letter contained no inclosure whatever  I did believe and still do believe that with respect to the penalty for selling foreign distilled spirits and wine without license it would happen    The duty laid on domestic distillation was never conceived to extend to them or attempted to be collected in them under the general law     1 Mr. Hamilton    The revenue that can possibly arise from the licenses in this  Territory is a very trifle and in most cases they have been purchased for this year already

 SOME CONSIDERATIONS AS TO THE DANGERS THAT BESET THE WESTERN TERRITORY AND HOW IT MAY BE PRESERVED AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE UNION The Western Territory is an important appendage to the United States The fertile soil and temperate climate seem to point it out as the place to which the emigrants from the Atlantic States will be directed     With the English settlements on one side and the Spanish on the other they will be exposed to the  machinaVOL    It is not to be doubted but the most alluring hopes and promises would be held out to them—if they did not become dangerous they would at least be very troublesome neighbors  It is said assistance from Canada has been promised them  She would probably stand single in the contest for it could not reasonably be expected that France would change all her measures to support America in a case where the wrong would appear to be on her part            Many people in the interior country now hold themselves in readiness to follow him infatuated to that degree that they are parting with their  property on any terms   The Spanish command on the  Mississippi are also assiduously endeavoring to induce the ancient French inhabitants to abandon their country and they have succeeded with great numbers  The lands upon the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers are fine and the climate inviting   The purchase-money might run upon interest In this manner the United States would receive nearly the same advantage as if the money had been paid in the first instance  This is not a visionary project but warranted by experience    The fear that the most valuable spot only would be taken and the rest remain unregarded is not reasonable to any great extent

 SPEECH OF GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DAY OF THEIR ADJOURNMENT DEC. 19TH   475 industry which have been manifested in your deliberations and the firm persuasion I have that the best effects will follow from them    It might even have been resented as an attempt to influence your deliberations but there is no impropriety in their being mentioned or in your hearing them now and I will give you that trouble were it only to satisfy you that I did not act from caprice    reject improper applications        The act further contemplated that the surveyors should hold their offices during good behavior Had the office appeared to be necessary it would have been among the last that would have been given by that tenure       The  measure appeared to be entirely premature         There is yet another reason gentlemen why those acts were not assented to                      your wishes and you are the best judges when the public business can be attended to with the least inconvenience   
 
 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO JAMES Rosa December no date 1799  Their last act was a very handsome address to the President from which there •wcre only four dissentients I have inclosed a paper which contains what I said to them when they were prorogued    Will you excuse me for troubling you a little further with our  affairs          You seemed to think it would be a proper measure and that nothing made against it but the additional expense it would occasion   But no time shall be lost when it does come about by directing an annual enumeration  11—31         But it is not every division that would answer those  pur» poses but such a one as would probably keep them in the colonial state for a good many years to come    483 the Territory divided by the great Miami the western division must return to the first stage      Their views tiro natural and innocent enough They look no further thaa giving consequence to Chillicothc But I am very much mistaken if their leaders have not other and more extensive views     There should be one lawyer on the bench where their decisions arc final If an additional number is appointed it would be a grateful thing  I am personally acquainted with him  ferent speaker but has fair reputation and is in great esteem with the people

 GOVERNOR ST.

 ADDRESS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL AND HOUSE OF  REPRESENTATIVES TO His EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR  Having naturally considered and examined the Ordinance we find no reason to change our opinion   It appears to the two Houses that this right naturally devolves on the General Assembly for it is a general legislative act within every State in the Union      GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR 'S REPLY             the inferences that may be deduced therefrom It is made expressly his duty   I will not dispute it I will only observe that the Congress did not think fit so to vest it           It would not indeed be very difficult to demonstrate that it is purely executive But it is not necessary to go into that  discussion because Congress has made it an executive duty            I must take the liberty to think that inference does not  follow   But courts would he useless without a fixed place for their sessions from whence their process is to issue and to which it must be returned     But justice can not be duly and regularly administered unless the courts meet at fixed times and places   You seem to think gentlemen that a judicial question may arise on this right I believe it to be impossible that it can  521 been guided the consequences you apprehend would not follow       It is clear they could not                P. 8    1  2  To revise the act entitled an act to establish and regulate ferries 4  u  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13 To amend the act entitled an act allowing and regulating prison bounds 14  15  18 Supplementary to the act entitled an act establishing and regulating the militia 17  18  19  20 Supplementary to the act entitled an act to establish and regulate county levies

 ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO THE GENERAL ASSEBMLY NOVEMBER 26 1801                 A sufficient time has since elapsed to show that it was a needless provision and that the militia may do well enough without generals and the cumbrous staff that is added to them       it to your consideration and it might be left optional with  themselves  In the treasury there is nothing and the revenue has not been so productive as was contemplated        To effect this inspection laws are indispensably necessary and should be guarded by very strong sanctions   That trust has not been executed and unless the Congress use coercive means it seems too probable that it never will be  executed         Your bills are printed that you may be able the better to consider them    I will not gentlemen detain you longer at this time         THE GOVERNOR 'S RESPONSE                REPLY OF THE GOVERNOR   It gives me pleasure to find gentlemen that the time appointed for your meeting has your approbation It was dictated by a desire that your attendance on the public business might coincide as much as possible with your private convenience             TUESDAY November 21th 1801   Door-Keeper—Edward Sherlock Messrs.

 GOVERNOR ST.

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO PAUL FEARING CHILLICOTHE January 15th 1802   We have long thought that very improper practices prevail in the post-office here During the last session the communication with Mr. McMillan was suppressed and when it was not was very irregular   Mr. Worthingtou and Mr. Baldwin must have been arrived at Washington some time Mr. McMillan will not set out under ten days yet to come and it seems doubtful whether Mr. Tod will go or not  present it another and I suppose the principal one is that there would be some difficulty in raising the money necessary for a special agent      I should have langhed nt the effigy   
 
 PAUL FEAEOG TO GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR 
 
    559 keepers informed me that I had two packages in the post-office that were too large to come free and that there was nine dollars postage charged on them I immediately conceived what they were and went up and took them out and got the postage reduced to pamphlet rate I have applied to Mr. Smith agreeably to your request   If Mr. Ross and Mr. Ogdeu should arrive the majority might be on the other side There are also two members absent who would vote with the present majority as is expected   I have seen letters which complain that should the division take place we could not go into a State government for fifteen years and all that time we should be kept in bondage etc I wish the persons were here that you mentioned were likely to come on    You will be able to give me your opinion before the law will be got through I do not know whether you will be able to read and understand my letter I have written it in so much haste 
 
 NATHANIEL MASSIE TO THOMAS WORTHINGTON CHILLICOTHE January 18 1802  the General Assembly will end Nothing very material has been done since you left this place    Mr. Baldwin was particularly aimed at but nothing could be raked up  We have now before us a bill to take the census this year but I am sure it will fail  From the latest information that county is more than one-half opposed to the measure 2 and it  appears that the more the subject is examined the more it is  deprecated    January 25th Colonel Jlassie wrote Mr. Worthington that the legislature closed Saturday without having accomplished much   The whole proceeded from Kimberley 's having expressed himself rather freely as to the influence that Putnam had over certain members which stung them rather much      As it always gives me pleasure to meet your wishes I cheerfully consented to both  There appeared to me so many serious objections to that act that I could not consent to its becoming a law     Cases in which that consent might probably be  obtained will readily present themselves to your minds   VOL        It is a precantion which every prudent married couple on leavinj their own country will take      But I can never  consent that a power to dispense with law in any case shall be vested in a subordinate and ministerial officer Accept my thanks gentlemen for the attention you have paid to every thing that was recommended

 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO COLONEL N.

 571 EDWAKD TIFFIN TO THOMAS WORTHINGTON CHILLICOTHE February 1st 1802  I have used every exertion to get Colonel Massie to draw up and forward on his charges We appointed three different times to meet on that business I always attended but could never get him there  I forwarded on by last post three depositions    
 
 To this gentle hint St. Glair responded in a note dated WASHINGTON June 23rf 1802. A stop shall be put to the fees immediately There are few  instruments so carefully drawn that different people will not differ about their true construction   A. ST. CLAIR Before this result is reached there are other letters which will engage our attention and which will occasion surprise and reflection    they now saw nothing but a change could remedy the evils we labored under and that they heartily wished it could be effected Mr. Smith is sorry he voted for an alteration in the boundary lines   I opposed it violently in the House and got it thrown out  I am informed the Governor intends to start in a week or two for Washington What are his objects I know not McMillan is expected daily through here also  Fearing

 ISRAEL LITOLOW TO THOMAS WORTHINGTON CINCINNATI Mardi 27 1802 Dear Sir    
 
 FEARING AND MR. GRISAVOLD IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE RESPECTING THE ADMISSION OF THE NORTH-WESTERN  TERRITORY AS A STATE INTO THE UNION MARCH 31 1802 Mr    But he was opposed to the resolution on constitutional principles He conceived Congress had nothing to do with the arrangements for calling a convention It was not necessary on general principles or under the compact that the Territory in order to be admitted into the Union should form a constitution By the compact  Congress can give their assent to admit the Territory into the Union before the population amounts to sixty thousand Their power  extends no farther   Worlhington Papers  577 the Territory may see fit Can Congress exercise power given  exclusively to the people He conceived it would be as great an  encroachment upon their rights to say they should meet together in convention and form a constitution as it would be to say so to any State in the Union             Now these resolutions go to interfere with these internal concerns and to regulate them by law       If too you may  legisVOL  late for these people before they are admitted into the Union you may also legislate for them afterwards If you do not like the  constitution they now form you may pass a law for another  constitution  Acting under such a principle there can be no stopping-ldace—you may go any length        I have long been persuaded that when gentlemen are determined upon any particular measure they can readily find pretexts for it The constitution is brought to their aid though the fact is the  Territory existed before the constitution was formed    The gentleman from Maryland and myself agree in one or two points    579 impose a convention upon these people without their consent    How is their  consent to elect delegates to be obtained  How else then can such consent be obtained      If the resolutions amount to any thing they amount to this  I am disposed to let them act for themselves—to divide or not divide the Territory into States as they please but I am against imposing any thing upon them contrary to their will  They and not we are to be bound by it  I contend that such a measure is extraordinary in this  country I know that it has been practiced in other countries    But I do not consider this as a proper objection for us to make as it ought to rest with the people to say whether they are willing to pay those taxes I sav again we have no right to impose a convention   If we interfere with the first we may interfere with the last 1 1 The measure passed and created a great ferment      By thnt article     We may thank our good friends Judges Symmes and Meigs and Sir 7 hnmas for what is done    
 
 581 GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR TO GEORGE TOD 
 
  WASHINGTONCITY April 2\st 1802    You state in your letter that you can not believe that the convention will accept the law us it now stands with the clogs that hang to it     At all events I am not personally disposed to make the experiment      We view it as unconstitutional as a bad precedent and unjust and partial as to the  representation in the different counties     doubtful there  I wish you would do me the favor to write me to Cincinnati and give me some light upon it But I have sir to request you to do me another favor I think it is probable that you may have heard that complaints have been made against me to the President       My  reply was If that is the case I will give them something to repeat  Soon after this Colonel Langham came into the room and the militia came upon the carpet       
 
  
 
 WASHINGTON May 1 1802 Sir —The act passed Congress yesterday anthorizing us to form a constitution    They have reduced the exemption from tax to five years and money to be laid out on roads to one-twentieth I wish you were within the Territory and would convene the legislature before the election for delegates to the convention We want some general system formed so that we may act together There might possibly be time when yon go in June but I fear you will not be our Governor at that time The more I examine the law the more I dislike it For my part I should be glad to see a convention formed by our territorial legislature with delegates from all the 1See Judge Tod 's letter to Mr. Madison    Mr. Cutler is still here and is much engaged in devising some plan to frustrate his friend Worthington I expect Congress will rise on Monday next I should he glad to hear from you You can write to Washington it will be forwarded to me 
 
 GEORGE TOD1 TO JAMES MADISON 
 
     The first subject  conversed upon was the President 's message   His reasons were that it would be trying too great an experiment        He died in Warren county April 11 18-11      Much he said about our militia and against it as being ineffectual but no expression fell from him like wishing for a  standing army    Those who plant themselves with a view to catch what was spoken in a heedless moment might remember many things which even most enemies would have forgotten or kept to themselves

 RETURN J. MEIGS JR. TO COLONEL WORTHINGTON MARIETTA May 18 1802   Thank heaven we shall go into a State government before long   Washington county will give you stiff Federalists in convention although I expect a change in a year or two more If it should happen it will be gradual Federalism has raged here this spring with intolerant fury It can not be tolerated by some that you should have had more influence with Congress than Mr Fearing  If so who will be his successor  Accept my esteem and consideration P. S.—Colonel Meigs has arrived and returned to Tennessee with his family 
 
   
 
 Attest FRANCIS Dex LAV Y J. DARLINGTON JACOIJ WHITE 1 MS. Worihington I upers        The committee in charge will probably induce the people to accept the offer without much consideration while I think it will be attended with a burden they are not able to bear     SPEECH OF GOVERNOR ST. CLAIR AT CINCINNATI Extract Fellow Citizenx —We will soon be called upon to perform a very important duty the most important that will devolve upon us in to the North-western Territory in 1800 mid settled in the Connecticut  Reserve near Puinesvillc  He was elected to the Senate under the State Constitution which ho helped to form and was chosen Speaker            Now this is  exactly what has been done by the societies No body knows what they are doing but the members and they arc pledged to support their own doings at all events  Republicans What is a  republican      Was this a man to say who were republicans and who were not    But it is no sport to us  But this same Mr. Kerr may have had and probably had another design   What was it to him He has nothing to lose by it but might have something to gain and if he did not succeed it was but going to another country   A mistake in the first formation draws after it consequences that can not be caleulated and which may grind our faces and deprave our manners to the latest generations     greatest care It was not with them the only question are they honest are they republicans for they were satisfied that if they trusted it to wise men they were cafe Becanse what they had to do was for themselves and their children as well as for those who  appointed them        
 
 NATHANIEL MACON 1 TO THOMAS WORTHIXOTON BUCK SPRING Sept. 14 1802.   He subsequently served two terms a* United States Senator  In the abovo letter he shows that ho held extreme opinions on popular government Mr. Mac in was educated at Princeton He died in Warren county June 29 1807. in his eightieth year  591 Slate government should succeed it will convince many that you abound with men who love places better than they should  The representation ought to be according to numbers and a married man ought to vote whether a freeholder or not The militia soldiers ought to elect their officers to captains the company officers the field officers and the field officers the general officers  I would prefer to have the Governor elected by the legislature and all officers elected for a limited time  
 
 These hints will show what alterations I would like in our Constitution if it is altered 1 NATHANIEL MASSIK TO THOMAS AVORTHINGTON 
 
 LEXINGTON October 1st 1802.  Indeed from what Major McArthur informs me you are already glutted with hand-bills and long tavern harangues The Major also informs me that Langham 's pamphlet has at last made its appearance and he thought it not quite so deadly as he had reason to expect from its being a great while talked about I suppose it must be the same that I sawjn manuscript at his house perhaps with a little addition  The parties in that county are exerting themselves to the utmost and I apprehend the dividing party are gaining ground They  calculate very much upon the upper counties joining them in this I a n in hopes they will be disappointed  time            —Chase p. 31 3Edward Tiffin was President The political revolution was complete            Errors no doubt I have fallen into    Party rage is stalking with destructive strides over the whole continent  But she is on the waves and can not now be stopped               595 language affords  The first is that the section No  It is to be observed that the section No                    But gentlemen why are conditions imposed upon us before we can obtain a right which is ours by nature and by compact Were conditions imposed upon Vermont or upon Tennessee before they could be admitted into the Union There was none attempted Why then this odious distinction in our case   597 it will not require much time if set about in earnest  It will not it can not be refused  That would go on equally well or perhaps better  The government was not retarded a single moment on that account  We have the means in our own hands to bring Congress to reason if we should be forced to use them
